                                            If your clients are experiencing joy and happiness only as an exception and not as a rule then they may be addicted to suffering. Come, listen and learn how to hear those things our clients use to distract themselves from joy. Once identified you can steer your clients out of their suffering and back to their Fulfillment, Balance and Process.<br />

                                            Eventually in any coaching practice you begin to attract clients who are already successful and who come to you looking for that something that is still missing. They want more depth, meaning and aliveness in their lives. They want to live based on their heart and soul. This call will explore coaching at the heart and soul level, using language that calls forth change from a deep place.<br />

                                            Part of the coach’s job is to support clients through conflicting motivations and desires to come up with their True Agenda. Motivations of the Child, Adolescent and Ego within are coaching agendas that can never succeed in the present, leading to frustration and stagnation in the coaching relationship. Uncovering and empowering the Adult’s Agenda is the path to real change and Fulfillment. This call explores key distinctions to help you listen for the powerful Adult within each of your clients.<br />

                                            We often work with clients who want to jump from one great idea to another, never really landing and making change, never integrating their experiences or discovering what lies under the surface of their wants and desires. This session challenges you to look at your clients and coaching practice from a brand new perspective. Using the CLAIMS model, we will help you move out of problem solving, struggling and suffering with your clients helping your clients find the deeper heart of their lives.<br />

                                            How comfortable and confident are you when it comes to responding to the emotions of your client? Are you able to make distinctions between authentic emotions that provide the fuel of empowerment, and the false emotions that create frustration and stuckness? To be a masterful coach, you must first recognize these distinctions. It is only in the vulnerability of authentic emotion that ownership and real change can occur. Join us for a fascinating session on the complexity of emotions!<br />

                                            How do you coach your clients about money? Finances are often a Saboteur-ridden topic, experienced as a burden to avoid. In this call, you’ll learn tips to combine rigor with pleasure, fun and ease as you coach your clients to financial health.<br />

                                            We so often speak of “holding...” We “hold” our client’s agenda. We “hold the Space” of a classroom, a Pod Call, a client session. What DOES that mean, anyway? This call explores this terminology, and the competency as CTI envisions it and will include brilliant conversation, and some skill drill type practice.<br />

                                            Where do you find your courage as a coach? How do you tap into your heart, since the root of courage is “cour,” the Old French word for heart? We will explore the structure of fear, where we hold back and how to step into a new place with your clients. Your clients will only go as far as you give yourself permission to go. So how far will you go into your fear?

                                            You've known about the skill of metaphor since Fundamentals. Are you finding that you don't use them or you don't find much potency with them? Perhaps you or your clients throw out a phrase every now and then — “you’re soaring like an eagle” or “I see that you’re stuck in a swamp.” Ho hum. Do you know that there’s a whole rich approach to coaching using mainly metaphors? On this call, you’ll learn how! <br />

This call will be a wacky, brainstorming-ish topic call where we will discuss together the intake of your dreams, not bound by laws of money or physics. Wild and crazy ideas will be given, and then some participants will be coached on what they would love to create and how to make it happen. We will demolish stale old intakes that bore the client and feel like rote exercises for the coach, and bring instead a livened sense of what is possible. <br />
