Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I have coached, inspired and motivated people my whole life. I am intuitive and love guiding people to their highest magnificence and wholeness.  I am passionate about coaching and transformation. I am a healer.  My life purpose is to heal others to the wholeness of their core essence.   Coaching does this.   I love it!   When I embarked on coach training, it gave me an avenue to do this professionally.  I love to teach, to guide, to be a channel for growth and transformation.

Level 3 response: : <br /><b>There is an awakening in the world, and a strong pull towards fulfilment in life that many are responding to now.   We have progressed so far in our careers, our success and in technology that we have lost ourselves and people are looking for ways  to rediscover and claim who they always were powerfully and run businesses in ways that serve modern corporate practices & ethics. There is growing recognition and support in the sciences that there is something bigger than any one of us and we are all one and connected with the  planet and its incredible systems.  People have a yearning to be connected to themselves and other and the something bigger.  There is a growing need to return to stillness and become acquainted with inner wisdom and the wisdom field of the universe, especially from the professionals and executives.  The wisdom field which is as old as time.  Its available to all.   Coaching enables people to access the portals to all of these things. Being a FORL gives me the opportunity to be at the portal that is there for the world. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

It was the third coaching session for this client who is very dissatisfied with how her multi-national employer has moved her around in executive positions without regard for what she has told them she wants for her career.   In this session, the client for the first time saw possibilities and choice instead of feeling victimized.   I coached her essentially in Process, touching on Fulfilment.  The extract under critique here is  the first 15 minutes of the session.    It is not my most fiery coaching and it was hugely important to be with the client exactly where she was and enable her to express her feelings, something she had not been able to do in the first two sessions.  Coming from the corporate culture that she does, she has told me expressing feelings is not a successful tactic and she has learned not to do it.   I was patient and curious with her.  As she obtained clarity, I called her forth.  There was resonance and an excitement moving forward at the end.   However, it has to be seen against the backdrop of a 50 minute session.   I felt that I did a great job of getting the client out of her head and into the place where she was actually expressing feeling what putting up with a job she finally admitted as mind numbing was doing to her.    This required the first 15 -20 minutes to get there.  I also took her to feel what it would feel like to have made the choice of choosing for herself this time.   We explored metaphors especially the living dead and the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.     I felt that overall over the 50 minutes I took the client   somewhere and it was new and exciting and resonant  for her.   She found a place of resonant clarity and choice around her next steps in her career and she also rediscovered the one in her who wore red and not the grey and black currently in her wardrobe.  There was a lot of learning overall in the session.   What I would have liked to have done more of was explore that saboteur who had hijacked her value of being responsible to the point that she lost herself and her friends by being ""responsible"".   I touched on it and its a whole coaching session in its own right.    I would also have liked to have slowed down the questions I asked toward the end of the session so that she could come to her own conclusions a little more.    I felt that in the first segment, although it was more of the client clearing and getting the foundations for where we were going. I held the client naturally creative resourceful and whole and she brought the agenda.     It was however as boring at times as her life has become.   We looked at her whole life absolutely and I danced in the moment with this fast thinking, powerful, intelligent, professional woman.   There was listening at level 2 and 3, I used curiosity to open things up for her and spoke my intuitions for her which deepened her learning and forwarded her action.  I felt it was important to be with her as she got it all out as this was the first time she was opening up to how it really was for her instead of talking about it at a high clinical corporate speak level.  I felt that I had created a safe and courageous space for her as we had re-scheduled the call out of office time so she could speak freely and then I called her forth.   Although the first 15 minutes excerpt does not illustrate all of the co-active coaching skills utilized, the end result resulted in the client's magnificence being called forth and July 3, becoming Carolyn's day, the day before Independence Day.  This was so hugely fulfilling for her and she said that after a really negative day, her day had been turned around into remembering that she was a person who liked possibilities. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
