Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Since my very first weekend in a CTI course 9 years ago, I wanted to be one of course leaders up there in the front - I'd never seen more powerful learning happen with just two people and a flip chart.  Throughout my journey as a coach, I've held the quality and integrity of the leading I've seen in CTI courses as the ""gold standard"" I've aspired to in workshops I've lead or co-lead myself.  From a purely Level 1 level, being a CTI Front of the Room Leader would stretch and grow me as a person, coach and trainer, and provide amazing on-going learning and development as a co-active coach and trainer by being deeply immersed in the model.  I know that part of the next phase of my work is about doing more teaching: being a CTI Front of the Room Leader would provide an opportunity to further develop and tap my natural skills as a teacher/trainer.  It would also provide opportunity to work at a higher, broader and more professional level than I am currently to have an even greater impact.    On the purely personal level, the Co-Active model profoundly changed my life, and has helped me create openings and growth in myself, my life and my family I never would have imagined were possible 10 years ago.  I am truly grateful, daily, for that transformation in myself; I am also consistently amazed by what I am honored to witness transform in my coaching clients as well.  Being a Front of the Room Leader also would be a part of serving my current understanding of my own purpose, which is to accelerate change:  I want to be part of evoking personal, organizational and systems transformation on a bigger and larger level.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The world is at a tipping point environmentally, socially and politically, and is ripe for transformation.  What I observe and notice on both an individual and collective level is that there is deep yearning and desire in the world for what Co-Activity offers - in our families, homes, communities, nations and world.  My own quest for development and growth is reflected in and by what I see as a world longing - for meaning, connection and change at a deeper level.  The pressing global issues of the day require a new approach - we won't solve global warming, hunger, poverty, injustice or any other local or global issue the way it's been approached to date.  These critical issues require us to change the conversation.  For me, the opportunity to be a Front of the Room Leader for CTI and leading Co-Active courses addresses this yearning at both the individual and global level.  Being a part of co-creating the emerging future through Co-Activity is nothing less than true global transformation.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My career before becoming a coach was as a supervisor, manager and leader within government and nonprofit agencies.  My primary client base as a coach is leaders, supervisors and managers in county, state and federal government, and have led workshops and staff development trainings within each of those organizations as a coach.  I am very familiar from having worked on the inside as well as having coached clients around typical challenges that leaders in large organizations and institutions face, including leadership development and supervisory/management training.  In addition to the workshops listed here, I have also lead a day long course within McDonald's as co-lead to Nina Simonds.  For the past 2 years, I've also expanded my experience by coaching corporate executive leaders and front line managers as a subcontracted coach with Solstice Coaching and Consulting (founded and run by a CTI trained and certified coach).</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I really enjoy the opportunity that comes with working with intact teams and groups.  The opportunity to leverage learning within an organization at multiple levels and truly shift the culture of the organization is very rewarding.  For me, I have often found that I can coach an individual to a certain point, but then they bump their heads into the systems in which they work.  Harnessing the power of individual change within systems change I find to be very powerful and impactful.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

I briefly designed the alliance with the client at the top of the call, and there was a warm connection with this client (who I'd only met briefly before starting the recording) throughout by continuing to dance in this moment with her throughout.  Skills present included some powerful questions, lots of articulating what's going on, lots of use of metaphor (used client's as well as offered my own), lots of acknowledgment (""it's in your DNA"", ""the amazing package of you"") and some championing (""you're on fire about this"", ""I can't wait to hear about you in your legal career""), and a couple of requests with some accountability at the end.  There was demonstration of range and embodiment through humor, a variety of vocal tones and genuine warmth and affection for this client and her path.      What could have been better: this was good solid coaching, and it could have been more courageous to evoke further transformation for this client.  The beginning of the call is a little mushy: I get a little nervous (Level 1 awareness of this being recorded/ wanting to look good) in places, and client was in a lot of story in the 1st 1/2 of the call, which was invited by me.  I could have gotten the needed clarity by asking more a specific and crisp question instead.  Also being willing to interrupt the client earlier in her stories might have served the client more.  The client's passion was evident, and I could have gone further with process skills to explore and amp this up with her so she could tap into and more fully use it in other places in her life.   Although I use metaphor with ease in coaching, I could have gone farther with some of the client's metaphors (spool of thread, scales) to help her harvest the learning from them.  I talked over the client a few times, asked two questions at once a few times, and just plain talked too much once.  I dropped following up the question about creating a vision from her values because she seemed to get what she needed from it, but stepped over an opportunity to use the example of her pediatrician to get more clarity about her own path.   There were also a few times that I didn't hear her words, and stepped over that rather than exploring or asking for clarification. I could have demonstrated more of my own range, and the tone I used served the coaching over all.  I also could have helped her nail down the applications of the metaphors we used - trunk, shoes - but at the same time she basically got what she needed from them.    Overall, this is a good example of my coaching style and approach.  What generally went well and what could be better in this demo call actually applies to my coaching over all as well: good solid co-active coaching that gets the job done, but could be more courageous for the sake of the client's transformation.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
