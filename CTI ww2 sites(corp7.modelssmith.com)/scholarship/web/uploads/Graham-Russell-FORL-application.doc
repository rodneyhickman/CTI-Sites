Level 1 response: : <br /><b>LEVEL 1 RESPONSE    Monday 10th June. I don't know why I want to check my emails as I get into bed at nearly 2am. Sitting in my inbox is this advert and it suddenly feels like Christmas eve. I am so excited I can't get to sleep. That's the energy I get thinking about wanting to be a CTI Front of Room Leader.    In a true and deep sense I can't tell you why. Yes there are benefits to me and yet this is something beyond me, I just know I have to present myself before you for this role. There is almost a reverence about it.    From the closing of 'In the Bones' an experience has stayed with me. Something 'hit' me that I wanted to be up there co-leading for CTI. It scared and excited me. I lit up, an energy buzzed through me and a passion filled my heart. I wanted to be there as an instrument for change. I wanted to be a part of training people to live fulfilling lives and for them to touch the lives of others. My journey has since then had that goal in mind.    I believe my work is in inspiring groups. I would love to teach and train the Core Curriculum because I believe in it and it works. The CTI way is like oxygen for me - it sustains me and brings me alive. It is my positive connection to life.    I work better with some structure in my life and co-leading courses with CTI will give me a framework and the space around which I can fit my own practice and projects.    I believe in the quality of professional coaching training that CTI offer, I trust the integrity of the training and I am in awe of the passion, the development and the research that has gone into the Core Curriculum. It is a rich, fertile, living course. It's participants and facilitators evolve, and you can't help but grow. And I want to be a part of the evolution that CTI is creating.    Becoming a CTI Front of Room Leader is quite simply a passion, a yearning to be in a privileged position to coach, train and inspire others to be a ripple of a fulfilled life. Gosh it's hard to write this and stay in Level one.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>LEVEL 3 RESPONSE    How do you put the wordless into words? To express my passion that is in the space?    My response from this place is much bigger, stronger, more purposeful and grounded.     This is about touching souls, illuminating hearts and lighting up the world.    I want to lead because it is all about the bigger picture for me. I want to see people living life and not wait in the wings for their cue. To learn what it feels like to be alive, to discover what it means to honour themselves and smile with joy. To touch the truth within and express the uniqueness of life.    Being Co-Active allows people to create an honest and empowered difference in their life, their work, their relationships, their family, to the cashier, the cleaner and the cab driver.    Everything we do in life has an impact somewhere and becoming conscious of our impact creates awareness. What if we allowed our impact to come from each of our hearts? What would the world look like where we are all living our truth? What would business look like working with integrity and countries united in possibility?    Possibility begins with each of us.    "If you think you're too small to have an impact, try going to bed with a mosquito in the room." Anita Roddick    Quite simply I want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader to make a difference. To offer people an opportunity to wake up to who they truly are, and feel the love and the impact they want to have in their world.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

I am currently co-creating two workshops for this year. One called 'Relationship with Self' about discovering ones own wisdom and intimacy.  And the second for gay couples in relationships. This we plan to extend to straight couples and then to redesign for businesses, focusing on how to be in relationship and communication with colleagues. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>BBC - As a freelance Art Director the BBC was one of my regular employers for 11 years.  Here I was in charge of a team to support and execute the creative and design elements of television dramas. I was a part of meetings with executive, creative and production personnel where each came with their own agenda for the show and agreements had to be reached in very short periods of time. Working in television I also had to learn to work under extreme pressure and tight deadlines.      British Airways -  This is a massive organisation. Watching a film about the company I experienced a momentary realisation at just how large it is. What has been fascinating about working here is the complexity of the organisation and the role communication plays, not just in everyday life but also in a major restructuring and cost-cutting programme.  I was part of an industrial dispute which caught the attention of the media and government. The meta-view was enlightening as was seeing what people will do to be 'right' and justify their behaviour, and the impact this has. One thing that intrigued me was understanding the 'presence' of the organisation (as explored in 'Presence' the leadership book on profound change). I experienced first hand how the company's actions had an impact on levels of trust, leadership, direction and morale, and the legacy it has left.  The organisation faces huge challenges in wanting to become more efficient by introducing more automation on the one hand and on the other hand wanting to enhance the customers inter-personal experience.    The wholeness of an organisation is important and that is created by the individual roles of its personnel. What gets created out of that amalgamation both physically, emotionally and spatially and the extent of its impact is sometimes hard for those in leadership roles to understand.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>One area I am passionate about is around openness of communication. Good communication builds trust and motivates teams. In so many places I have worked there has been a culture of blame where nobody will take responsibility for fear of reprisals. When something has gone wrong energy and time is spent on finding the culprit and covering ones own back. I believe a failing is an opportunity for learning and growth, for encouragement and to unite with courage and humility to create efficient and effective results within an organisation.    Having a creative background as well as experience in large organisations allows me to appreciate and coach beyond the confines and narrow perimeters within which some corporate thinkers tend to operate. Creativity allows people to stretch beyond the norm and to explore beyond the chink of light in the corporate cocoon.    I love holding a big space where people can dance and dare to voice deep held thoughts and possibilities. Going to the heart of creativity is where the future can be created.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

This client, Debbie (name changed) - has been working solidly for two years, she is setting goals at work and not getting them, is demotivated and feels guilty about having time out.     Critique:    My focus is on Debbie as a person rather than the work issues she has brought. I don't get caught in wanting to fix or find solutions.    There is room to dance in this session and stay curious as to what we find. I use a blend of process and fulfilment tools. There is a safe space, which allows Debbie to explore her thoughts, feelings and gives her emotions a chance to breathe and surface. I listen and am curious.    Many of the questions in this session are powerful which take Debbie somewhere.    "Where's that coming from?" Debbie isn't sure and I could have suggested that a metaphor might help her here. I use metaphors a lot in my coaching and I notice I don't use them here, which surprises me.    A lot of the questions I ask are coming from her words: "you proclaim you are happy working on your own. How true is that?"  As an aside, a week later Debbie contacted me to say she had moved from her home office and now rents an office space amongst creative professionals - this did not come from any request or homework and is a great testament to the CTI model of people being naturally creative, resourceful and whole and that the learning and action continues after the session.    "Where is this 'should' coming from?" I am curious. What saboteur is here?  I slip in and intrude and bring her back to the question.  I do acknowledge Debbie later on but an acknowledgement around here might have been helpful for her.     The session has an ease about it and there are moments of lightness which brings in some clarity and another perspective.    I ask 'is that being financially independent?' It's closed question and although it has an open intention it doesn't take us far. An open question would have been more powerful.    Intuition is telling me that there is something here around financial independence. I ask the same question twice and although I start to get the same answer the second time a fear of Debbie's surfaces. A reframe here and a more powerful question such as ' What's underneath this desire to be financially independent?' would have served the coaching better. I hear a dissonance and it feels like something is collapsed.  I blurt 'yes, your relationship has got something to do with this'. It completely falls out of my mouth. I have a moment here where I go to Level 1 and self manage hearing what I said.    "What's coming up now" - it takes Debbie further into her self discovery this touches a spot in Debbie's past and her value around equality, which we go on to explore.    At the end of the session Debbie takes away that her tireless drive to work and earn, and consequent lack of motivation is wanting to match her partner's financial input to the household. Her wanting to be financially independent is an old story and doesn't sit with her value of equality in a partnership.    I've loved listening back this session - it was wonderful to create some learning from it ... and shown me what I do well.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
