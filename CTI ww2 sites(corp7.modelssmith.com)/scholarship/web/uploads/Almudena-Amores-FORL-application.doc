Level 1 response: : <br /><b>The coaching in particular and the co-activity in general have changed my life.   I love coaching, as much as I love training. Both are my passions and both, each in a different and, at the same time in a similar way, make me feel alive, energized, useful and resourceful, creative, fulfilled and grateful for the opportunity to support other people to live their lives the way they want to, to live their best version.   Being a CTI Front of Room Leader would give me the opportunity to gather my two passions and training people in co-activity and in help them to become great coaches would be a privilege.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The intense way I've integrated the co-activity into my life, my passion, my generosity, my love, my faith in the human being, my vulnerability and authenticity, my desire to share... in the end, who I am as a leader, inspire people in a strong way and every day I am more and more aware about it. Very often, people in general and coaches in particular come to me looking for resources and inspiration to grow, both, in their personal or professional lives. I am a reference for many of them. This is the impact I have. This is something powerful and at the same time it's also a responsibility I want to take.    I know I have a lot to give, and also a lot to receive and to learn. This is the main purpose for me to be a CTI Front of Room Leader. It's part of my Life Purpose. I can't keep all my resources, my strength, my knowledge and who I am, inside myself; I want to bring it all out and place it at the service of others.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>My current market niche consists mostly of coaches, most of them in their certification processes. I also coach some managers and do some life coaching</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.

What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>o Workshop "Customer Service Skills in the Tourism Industry" (Hotel Sa Franquesa Nova, Mallorca)   o Course "Coaching Skills for Teachers" (Teacher's Training Centre Toledo)  o Workshop "Leadership and Coaching for Science Tutors" (University of Edinburg, Scotland).  o Workshop "Communication and Coaching Skills for University Teachers" (Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya)  o Program "Coaching and Leadership for Teachers, Students and Parents" (Blanxart High-School)  o Workshop "Coaching Skills for Teachers" (Maristas High School)  o Course "Leadership, Team Coaching and Communication" (Conde Rodrigo Hotels)  o Workshop "Leading your life" (Municipality of Noblejas, Toledo)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I'm very used to working in public or private companies, as I did it in my "previous professional life", before becoming a coach. Training in organizations was an important part of my work before, and I loved it and want to continue working in this area.   Since approximately one year ago I've started working again in some organizations, now being supported by the coaching and coactivity approach and I feel I have many more resources and a different and more effective and powerful impact. In these organizations I deliver some training and coach some managers, especially in the Tourism sector.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>What I see is that bringing the co-activity into organizations is something amazing. It has given me new resources and tools to work with, and, the most important thing, a new perspective and a different essence to transform organizations with a huge impact. Seeing how business people transform their lives after few hours working on themselves makes a significant change in them, in the places where they work and in society en general. My belief is that bringing emotions, soul and humanity into business is essential.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Where I succeed was: I was curious and present with my client, listening to him and articulating what was going on (different energies, ex. by letting him know for example "you are more alive now", "there is a big smile on your face"); I used powerful questions (ex. "what is a relationship for you?, What are your hands telling you?, what do you see when you look at the balcony?, what's the meaning of going there for you?, what is it new here now?, which are the possibilities in a place like this?, what are you connected to when you say that?"..); I used quite a lot geography and articulated what was going on because of that; I used my intuition: ex. When I told him "I have the intuition you are leaving your saboteur behind by moving on"; I took charge and made my client move on in different moments; There was accountability through the inquiry: "who are you?". I also followed my client's agenda (ex. not worrying about the recording conditions on the balcony, knowing that it was a place for him to grow). Cornerstones were present in the session: forward action and deepen learning, belief that my client is creative, resourceful and whole and specially the cornerstones focus on the whole person and evoking transformation (increasing my client's awareness about his capability and how achievable what he desires can be).    Something to have been done in a better way was: I should have use intrude and bottom-lining more often (ex. at the beginning to identify the topic quicker and, later on, at least in a couple of moments); I didn't name the saboteur the first time it appeared (when my client was talking about "how difficult finding a soul mate is") although I mentioned the saboteur later on, when it appeared again); sometimes I didn't give full space to my client to answer (a better management of silence was needed); there were some moments when I could have thrown some acknowledgements, especially at the end of the session. And concerning about accountability, I could have proposed a stronger counter offer for the time he will be travelling to help his commitment be more significant.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
