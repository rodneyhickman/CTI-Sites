Level 1 response: : <br /><b>  The reason why I want to be a Front of the Room leader is that I want to be actively involved in creating a learning environment that inspires people to grow, stretch and love. Love themselves and love others. It is absolutely in line with my life purpose, as I am committed to live with an open heart and want to support others to do the same.    Though I am already doing this work in my private practice there is something very special about the CTI community. It is the support network of people, who listen to the same beat and have a very similar calling. I get incredible satisfaction every time I find myself in the company of members of the CTI community, or I partake/assist in a course.    I have been impressed at the way the curriculum is structured. The ability to dive deeper into the co-active work is certainly another motivating factor. I am keen to grow my skills as a leader, being mentored by seasoned leaders and taking advantage of the training opportunities that would arise. Further the networking opportunities will be plenty and I expect a healthy increase in my private practice.    I am motivated to spread co-activity into the world and I am interested in getting involved in Europe/Germany. I am drawn to the traveling and exploring aspect of this work.    Though I am not meeting the requirements for this application, I see it as a great opportunity to invite the possibility to get selected anyways. I now I will build my business and my hours in the near future and I believe I will be a assit to the CTI leadership team.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>For me CTI is about love and aligning people with the consciousness of love. And love is the greatest weapon against the fear driven human behavior that leads to separation amongst each other, oneself and our natural world.  Therefore, spreading co-activity for me is a powerful way to make a difference in this world, which desperately needs us to stand up, lead and co-create together a future that I want my children to experience. I feel like I have a responsibility to stand up and lead, to make a difference.    CTI packages ancient spiritual wisdom in a very powerful and practical way. It calls forth the individual to overcome their fears and step into their light. The work brings out the good in humans and from this place the possibilities of doing good become endless. It brings hope that we can turn around the state of affairs on this planet after all.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Listening to the recording, I realized that I could have created more "black" energy through my tone of voice and my words. Giving myself permission for more range would have possibly extended his range and deepened the experience and learning.   Though a powerful question: "What did you just allow yourself to do?" - it felt like it brought him out of his process. Yet the question allowed him to have a great insight of seeing himself and being seen.  I could have explored the nothingness, the black hole and been more curious about the images that popped up, by asking questions like "What do you see" & "What is the black hole". It felt like there was more to it.  The ship is a reference of his Captain and Crew - I could have tied it in to connect him to his Captain, which again could have deepened the learning.   Acknowledging him for his realization and allowing himself to be vulnerable would have been more powerful then saying "beautiful".   I am ending this 15min. with raising his awareness about allowing himself to experience all emotions and give him some advice. Not very coach like. Instead I could have used a powerful question such as: "What is possible if you don't hold back your emotions?" to make him realize that it is important to "play the whole range of the keyboard".  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
