Choosing a principle and doing process coaching as the client was very much in her head and logical thinking and had difficulties getting into the experience. Creating a safe and courageous space by holding the client naturally creative, resourceful and whole and creating spaciousness by e.g. checking my assumptions, asking for permission to try something, leaving space between the questions. Granting the relationship power by speaking my intuition (e.g. I'm getting a sense that....), listening at levels 2+3 (e.g. I can see an emotion in your eyes, what is that about ?; I sense sadness there, what is it ?), using a lot of curiosity and powerful questions (e.g. what would that give you ?; in what way is that a hindrance today ?;  if we turned up the volume of that, what is it ?; give me an example). Deepening the learning of the client leading to her having an "aha" moment and wanting to go more into depth of her emotional side (e.g. what is going on for your right now ?; what are you learning/becoming aware of ?).     What was not an effective demonstration of Co-Active coaching:  Evoke transformation by intruding more to keep the client in the experience when she goes back to her head rather than living what is happening in the moment. Using the skill of making a distinction would have helped her understand that, e.g. developing antennas to recognise when she may be insensitive does not mean she will loose her natural quick sense of humour, which is an integral part of who she is. Use acknowledgment for her achievement to overcome her alcoholism and making many behavioural changes in her life.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
