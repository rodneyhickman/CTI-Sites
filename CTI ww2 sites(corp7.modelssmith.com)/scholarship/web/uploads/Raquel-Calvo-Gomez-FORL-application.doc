Great level 3 and level 2 listening  Using my curiosity in a ""clean way"" considering my client creative, resourceful and whole, letting her explore the topic and articulating what i was feeling, naming and exploring the emotions that appeared and making the client more aware of who she is and what is important for her, using acknowledgements, metaphors and powerful questions.   I danced in the moment with my client, being able to read the emotional field and articulating what was going on on the emotional level and how the energy was dropping and raising.  Evoking transformation by making the client being aware of her emotions about the topic, naming the emotions and articulating what I was feeling on the level 3.  There was a moment when the client said she was happy and I felt some dissonance in her tone of voice, I articulated that I was listening some worry. So, I was blurting my intuition using the information from the level three.  I used mainly process coaching, exploring how she was feeling and naming the emotions, using some metaphors that came from the client. Also used some fulfilment coaching questions like ""what is your vision? Who is the authentic you? Which part of you is getting in your way?   We explore a couple of options and I asked to make a conscious choice by asking: What are you saying yes to? As we do in balance coaching,  which made her reflect  be aware of her priorities to make a conscious choice. I continued with: What do you want? And she committed with an action to do in the next week, which was something new for her and a challenge too.  So, I just requested an action for the accountability, and she agreed.    I designed with my client to have a15 min session. I'm satisfied with this one as transformation was evoked,  I kept the focus while dancing in the moment, I read and articulated the emotional field, the client was is more aware on who she is, how she was feeling and what is important for her, making a conscious choice to be more fulfilled.     In a longer session I would have explored more the emotions, using geography and more metaphors. I might have used more my range. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
