Level 1 response: : <br /><b>The world of coaching is expanding globally and I want to be a part of it.   Before becoming a CPCC, completing CTI Leadership, and starting my business two years ago, my career has been leading me towards coaching for a long time.  For more than 20 years, I've helped individuals and teams go from good to superb.  As a Director and senior leader in a corporation, I was responsible for leading large and complex programs to deliver software solutions.   I won awards for this, and was good at it.  However, where I excelled was in discovering and developing talent.    The leaders on my team were consistently ranked as the highest in combined performance and promotability within the corporation.   Creating future leaders, and helping people unleash their passions, was my greatest passion.   To do this, I created many forums for my team to grow and develop.  So, within the corporate world, even though my title was Director of Information Technology, my true gift was training and developing talent.      My leader quest is to "be the change I wish to see in the world, for the greater good".  Coaching allows me to do that.   I continually hear about the impact I have on my clients.  I see it in their eyes and hear it in their acknowledgements.   Being a front of the room leader for CTI will allow me to bring the spirit of coaching, along with the powerful expression of coaching that CTI uniquely creates, out further into the world.   To expand CTI's reach, grow the number of coaches that CTI is developing, and impact all the clients whose lives are transformed by CTI, for the greater good.      I'm grateful for this opportunity to bring my gift of training and developing talent, for the sake of unleashing new CTI coaches, and helping them to become unstoppable.   Coaching works.  I'm here, I'm ready, and I'm passionate about CTI and creating new coaches.   I believe in the CTI model, and I believe in creating transformational change through the clients that coaching touches.   I feel honored to be considered as a Front of the Room Leader, and my deepest request is to become part of your training organization.       </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>As I see myself in the front of the room, I see hearts on fire. The world is changing, and the world needs CTI now. There is an explosion, an expansion of the need for new coaches in the world.  The thirsts of these new coaches are quenched when they step into a CTI training room.  More and more, coaches are showing up ready.  Curious and ready, to receive, to learn, and to have their lives reshaped.  As the new coaches come into a coaches training workshop on the first day, the space is curious. It's filled with yellow, some white; there is some nervousness here, a little maroon, and a bit of grey.   They come, drawn by the heartbeat of the coactive dance, eager with anticipation.  Myself, and my co-leader are at the front of the room, leaning in 100/100. We're here for them, we love them, we're ready, and are eager to train them.  To help these new coaches put on their wings and soar.  The workshop is underway. Now there is a big YES, an orange energy in the room.  They know that CTI is their tribe. They've found themselves. They're home.      I'm here today, knocking on your door.   I'm ready.  I am feeling my pulse, my heartbeat quicken with urgency about the new coaches that are waiting, and need for CTI in their lives, and for the lives of all the clients they will meet in the future.  The clients are waiting for them, especially in the corporate world.  They are calling and beckoning for these new coaches to show up in their lives.      The world, the times they are  a 'changing.  The world needs CTI and co-activity more than ever.  I want to be a part of it.  I can make a difference for you.  I feel that in the level 3 space.  When the co-active dance is there, it's one of the most beautiful breath-taking things.   The space needs what CTI brings to the world.    My request to you is to allow me to be a part of your training team.  Thank you. I honor you and the work you're doing out in the world.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

The client had chosen a perspective that she made a wrong decision to heal holistically.  Early in the coaching, the client notices a gap between her elbow and wrist.  Through listening at level 2 & 3, I ask the client to explore that, which takes her to a gap in her heart.  As we explore that, the client discovers a metaphor of 'coating around her heart'.  Using my own embodiment of geography and intuition, I blurt 'umbilical sac', which takes the client into a deep exploration of what nourishes her.  From that place of resonance (the beginning of this demo tape), the client creates a clear view of what healing really means for her: holistic healing with conscious meaningful action.  Throughout, the client repeated a theme of 'time', so I named that.  It was a powerful question for the client and brought her deeper.  The client said that healing is 'moment by moment.  I asked the client to embody 'empowerment', which took her to 'joy'.  Inviting the client to explore her gut opened up a source of intuition and also reassurance about her decision.  It was powerful for the client to get that distinction. The coaching ended with the client in deep resonance and celebration.  I asked her to acknowledge herself, and I also acknowledged and championed her, giving her a larger place to stand in her decision.  At the end, I made a request of the client to 'lock it in', with a request to find a symbol to embody her strength and empowerment for what she committed to doing and being.        My coaching started by exploring the clients' perspective then moved into process coaching to explore the client's heart and gut.  The client was powerfully tuned into her experience, so I mostly listened and articulated at 2&3, to hold the clients' agenda and evoke transformation.  The saboteur sat silently in the background, so I chose to ignore it and build resonance.  Places to point myself to improve my coaching are to use more geography, and perhaps tie in the client's values or life purpose for additional resonance.  Additional acknowledgements could be sprinkled throughout.   I'm curious about my use of self-management, and whether more intruding would have been in service of the client (in L3, I chose client shining/coach fading). Overall, the coach sat solidly on the 4 cornerstones and context of the model, supported by an empowered relationship in support of the clients' agenda.       Dana Kadue Coaching Demo Transcript  (note: Coaching was on Skype and the quality was a bit low. At one point, the call dropped.  So, I""ve included a transcript.  The tape starts as the client called back.  Note:  Client text is in <> )    <I'm sorry I don't know what happened to the connection. When we were disconnected, I just continued with the suggestions that you gave me, and it was just so beautiful, so powerful, I just want to thank you.>    And what are you noticing Laurie?   <It's a healing a wholeness, an understanding, a deep deep deep core understanding of the healing I am needing and wanting to do.>   And what is wanting to be created that you are needing and wanting to do? < Complete and total healing.  its something. I think we can heal a lot on our own. If the body wants to heal, the heart wants to heal, but something I know is that life gets so busy, can become so hectic that we just go about our returning to our daily lives without really taking conscious time . Conscious meaningful action, visualizations, affirmations, just time to heal, to become more whole. To really be able to move on with a foundation>  There is something about time here, and what it is it with time? <Oh boy, Dana that is such a powerful question. For me because time is maybe not for me but for so many people, time is such an important dynamic in peoples' lives.   And bring that back to heart and your healing.  And what your heart is looking for now.  >  What is needed now? <You know, it is the realization.  Wow this is so interesting, I'm having so many different kinds of thoughts and understandings just kind of simultaneously dancing around in my head, and in my heart.  And it's like the power of now.  The power of now, you know what, it's a journey but it's also. I  don't quite know how to articulate it. But it's the realization that healing is in the moment, and its the moment by moment. Adding onto the moment by moment that creates that process.  It's the healing in the future extremely important because I know it is going to take time. But it's also the healing in the moment than is so much more important than I realized before.>  Laurie, and know that in each and every moment you have the answer s that you need.  <That's it.  That's it. you just articulated right there, what I was feeling, what I was understanding. >   And you helped me to find the answer  that you need for your healing. When I say that, what comes up for you?   <Very very powerful Dana.  This is very very powerful, it feels empowering.>      And with that sense of empowerment, what does your heart need right now for the healing ?  <joy>  Joy < Joy>  And where does that joy come from ?  <Right now, it's like it's in my gut. It's in my gut.  >  Yes, so let's go into your gut, and sink into that. look around, feel around.  Whats in your gut, Laurie?  <It's power >  So describe that for me, what is that power like?  <You know, it's the first time Dana. I've heard we have. In Eastern systems we have dantians, and its brain-like tissue, matter, not just like the brain in our head. But in the solar plexus and also deeper area,  lower in abdominal cavity.  And this is the first time I've sensed that as like a brain. >  There is a power and an intelligence.   <Yes, yes, exactly>   So what is needed for your healing?    <You know what. It's what I've just said and what you just helped me do.  connect with that.   with that.  you know.   They say the gut intuition. It's the intuition that I know, I know,  and this is why I did make the decision not to have the surgery.  I have the power and ability to heal my wrist. My body knew that. its why my body told me not to have that plate implanted.>  I really hear that.   You are just alive right now. I hear it in your voice. you have an inspired sense for  what you need for your own healing.   < Dana, that's true, I cannot tell you how important this is.  I have the reassurance that my body did make the right decision.  I know it, I feel it, I don't doubt it.>  And what does your body need right now?   < Celebration>  What wants to be celebrated?   <That I listened, that I really listened. That I trusted myself. That I trusted that.  That I trusted my body.  I truly believe our bodies have the ability to be our best guides, our best physicians assistants.   You know, maybe they say, ok go ahead and get surgery. but there are some times that we have important healing to do in ourselves. its just not about the end result, its about the process. Yeah, and I have so much understanding and gratitude for making the decision that I've made. and I was starting to doubt it and I have come back to really feeling it at gut level - at heart level - a heart decision. >  Creating from this deeper level of your knowing.  In this place of celebration, my sense of it is this crystal clarity is here that you've made the right decision .  In this place what do you want to acknowledge yourself for?  <For making that decision, for trusting. >  Yeah.   <For trusting.  I tell so many people, the reason we do so many practices yoga, meditation, tai chi, etc etc, is to move deeper and and deeper in our own bodies and our own beings where have that guidance, that wisdom of the body.   I practiced what I preached, and I was doubting it.  I'm relieved.  I am celebrating the fact that I did trust.  and  I'm not beating myself for doubting. I think  its part of the journey too. >   And just skip to letting go Laurie. You are here at a place of balancing a part of you who knows. Your mind/body/spirit. And there is just something important here that you just claimed.  In service of you, and in service of your healing.  And, I want to really acknowledge you for that awareness for having that  willingness to put it out there that you were at that low point, and weren't trusting yourself and shining a light on it, and xxx(not decipherable)xx on the right path, in service of your healing.   < Thank you.  >  So Laurie, what is possible from here?  < What is possible from here. What feels so totally possible from here is continuing on this journey of being, and connecting mind/body/spirit in the healing process. The allowing. And I think just .. what makes me feel better is feeling it's ok to have the down times as part of the journey.  It is not just this climb or descent.  You know what I mean.  That there are going to be hills. and that, what I got from this, was that experience of feeling my gut like I did. that was so powerful, I know I can go there. >  I want you to really lock that in Laurie.  Yeah.  I want you to really go into that place and set that intention and hold that intention. And from that place, trust the impossible.   Because you know, you know what you need.   And so what will you do, what will you do to lock in that sense of that knowing?  That you are on the right path of your healing?  < Dana, it feels like I need to do is find a symbol, find a symbol, whether it be a stone or something.  I'm going to.  When I hang up from you, I'm going to go on a walk and find something that I'm going to keep with me, carry with me. Something small.  I'm not sure what it's going to be, but it feels to me like it's going to be something natural, something connected, something with earth energy. And meditate with it. And keep it with me as a symbol that I can always go to that place inside me to renew that strength and empowerment.>  Strength and empowerment.  And I hear that there's these valleys, ascents and descents in your healing journey. And just know you have the strength. That as you take a stand for yourself,  that what you need is here for you.   < I really feel that.  this has been just a.   Dana, Thank you so  much, this has been such a real  real  important renewal. This is exactly what I needed. Exactly what I needed. >  Ok Laurie.  So my request is to get a symbol of your healing journey and the thing that will help keep you strong.  And when will you do that?   < I'm going to do that right away.  I'm going to do that right now. >  And how will I know?  < I can email you.  >   Sounds good. Thank you.  anything else?   < Dana, thank you very much this is very powerful for me.  Thank you for being there.  >  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
