I AM type: : <b>Charm</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Being a CTI Front of the Room Leader has been a dream of mine since I attended Day 1 of Fundamentals.  It feels like a great fit with my training, group facilitation, and coaching skills and experience, my talents, and my passion for coaching.  I have worked for many years as a trainer (and trainer of trainers) primarily in the areas of child abuse prevention, substance abuse prevention, and parenting. I spent many years as a credentialed adult educator.  I really enjoy training adults (almost seeing the light bulbs come on as they "get" the material.)  I am a very interactive trainer and teacher, and am able to connect with the group and individuals in it.   Since taking CTI's Leadership program, I find my most successful trainings are those where I come from my I AM type - which is Charm. True to my type, I find it relatively easy to establish rapport and comfort (personal safety) among diverse groups of trainees.  As an experienced support and coaching group facilitator, I am aware of how things "land" in a group or with individuals in it, am able to check with them on how the landing went, and adjust the training accordingly. I'm also able to keep my awareness on the group as a whole and remark on the level 3 in the room.  Also, during CTI Leadership, I was privileged to learn and practice Co-Active leadership, which seems to suit my style of training. I am open to further training in this method. My experience with Improvisational Theater was also helpful in training me to "think on my feet" and to work sensitively with other leaders. My work with Fritz Perls at Esalen Institute taught me to stay in the present, which has been helpful with leading groups and my ability to use process coaching. Coaching is my passion, and has been since 2006.  My enthusiasm for coaching is infectious with individuals and groups that I coach or try to enroll in coaching. I find myself teaching coaching skills in my coaching groups, in an attempt to "spread the word."  Finally, I love traveling and training together.  I enjoy the learning that I get from being in different places and working with people of different cultures and backgrounds.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I believe the values/concepts taught at CTI can be powerful enough to change individuals, groups, and communities. Values such as respect, holding others naturally creative, resourceful and whole, connectedness and co-activity in coaching and leadership, non-abuse of power in relationships, helping people find "answers" within themselves, and many others, are valuable coaching tools. I would like to train new coaches in order to help them open themselves to these values and reinforce those they already hold. This not only would have a greater impact on coaches, it would also heavily impact the clients and communities in which they live and work.  My wish to have an impact on coaches and the larger community is connected to my Life Purpose; which is to ensure that children have a safe childhood, and grow into respectful, respected, resilient, fulfilled adults, who then have a powerful effect on changing their communities.  I see training coaches as a powerful way to transform communities, and to empower the children within them. As these coaches start coaching out in the world, they become role models for adult clients, and in turn for children (since clients may be parents, grandparents, teachers, and other community members) as they "walk their talk " and live their values.  By impacting children in this way, we can empower the generations to come to work towards a more peaceful, respectful world.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>5. This number is low, and is not typical of my usual coaching average of 10 or 11 clients. During the first 4 months of 2013, I was deep in grieving the death of my best friend of 49 years and was unable to work at my usual capacity. In the months of May and June, 2013, however, I averaged 11 private coaching clients.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <b>11</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>$900. Again this is due to the lower income in Jan.-April.  In May and June alone, my average was $1950.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>45% (Would be 51% if Jan.-April had been at usual capacity.)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2007</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Women in leadership and transition. Parents.Co-Parents. Grandparents.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>10% of my practice is with nonprofit organization leaders</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Coaching groups for Women in leadership and transition. Will begin a Grandmas coaching group in August. Relationships (co-parent coaching for court-ordered divorced couples, married and partnered couples and families with older children.) </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <b>none</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I have led many courses/workshops for parents and teachers, such as: Positive Discipline, Raising Your Spirited Child, Handling Anger (Yours and Your Child's) Interrupting Power Struggles, Keeping Our Kids Safe (for parents of disabled and non-disabled children) and workshops for Single Parents. I also provided Training for Trainers in the Keeping Kids Safe curriculum for elementary school teachers.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>I have been and continue working as a contracted workshop/course leader for the following nonprofit organizations: oParents' Place - San Francisco. At least two workshops per months for the past 20 years. o Family Paths, Inc. Role: Former staff (Parent Educator) Provided 12 session classes for parents (4 per year, for 6 years. Currently substitute teacher for parent classes (3 times/year.) oCamp Tawonga. Role: Lead workshops at Family Camps (approximately 3/year, 3 workshops per camp session, for the past 8 years. I also helped organize the Windcall Touchstone Coaching Program. Role: Serve as member of pool of coaches, providing coaching sessions for nonprofit organization leaders after their residency at a Windcall retreat center to help with re-entry into nonprofit leadership role, or transfer to other work. This was my community project for CTI's Leadership program, and has proven quite successful. (4 years.)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have many years of person and professional experience with nonprofit organizations that make me well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in these organizations. I was the founder and executive director of two nonprofit organizations concerned with parenting and child abuse prevention, for a total of 19 years. While directing the second organization, I completed coursework and received my MPA (Master of Public Administration) in Nonprofit Organization Management from the University of San Francisco. I wrote my Master's thesis on Women Executive Directors of nonprofit organizations; how their feminist values affected their use of power in a management role. After retiring from the executive director position of the second organization in 1992, I became a consultant/trainer with nonprofit organizations, and led workshops on Women in nonprofit management, and other management issues, primarily through the CA Office of Child Abuse Prevention. In my capacity as Chair of the Northern California Coalition of Child Abuse Prevention Programs, I learned from other nonprofit leaders about challenges in managing their programs. I believe the Co-Active training model is a good fit with the nonprofit organization culture as I understand it.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I have also worked in nonprofit organizations as line staff, supervisor, and contractor, and believe I understand the internal workings of nonprofits from these perspectives too.

The session flowed. We "danced" together well. I stayed with her - matching her energy, and tone of voice. Starting the session with the question, "What would you like to work on today?" got her to her agenda: getting her business started. I helped her move it to a big A agenda, (Serenity), which we explored and ended with the Inquiry "What does Serenity mean in terms of the cloud metaphor?"  Details: There were several points in the session where my use of powerful questions and focusing on how she was feeling in the moment were helpful in moving her forward.   o Having her tell me when she felt excited led her to her bigger goal. Bottom- lining her when talking about a new client felt somewhat abrupt, but it helped focus her on her excitement, and telling her she looked happy and asking what that was about led her to talk about having control of her time, an important value for her.   o Powerful questions such as, "What's important to you about helping others?" and "What does it mean to have meaning in your life?" helped her look at "meaning" in her life and led to the concept of "right fit." When asked for a metaphor for "right fit" she came up with "cloud."  Then we danced in the moment using the cloud metaphor; having her show me her feelings of lightness and freedom using her body. This was perhaps the highlight of the session, in which I perceived her at resonance. We continued with this metaphor; asking her how her work related to the cloud.   There was a point in the session where I may have strayed from the Co-Active model, but I think I recovered. When she mentioned "Serenity," and I asked her what Serenity meant in terms of the cloud, I reacted with chills to her answer! I reported it to her, because of its strong impact on me. (Maybe I could have spent less time on my level 1 reaction, but it was so strong.) I did tell her that when people have strong reactions to her statements as I did, they were probably deeply held values for her.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
