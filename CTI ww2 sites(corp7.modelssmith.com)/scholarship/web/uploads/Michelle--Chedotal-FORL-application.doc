Level 1 response: : <br /><b>The co active coaching model and its way of delivery is totally mind blowing ! It has taken me to a different level of understanding not only of myself, but of others and I believe it should be delivered to as many people as possible. The co active coaching model helps change lives. By becoming a Co active leader, you are learning at a deeper level, from the model and from the participants. It is organic, changing, evolving and you are part of it. The co active coaching model is not limited to life coaching, but to any ways of life, social, professional or cultural.  Coaching and leading make you a better person, more connected to others and seeing them for who they truly are helping them to go where they want to be. And that is phenomenal ! </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>When I read the new book again (3rd edition) I could feel the energy of Laura Whitworth, a gentle and yet powerful energy holding my hand as I was turning the pages : I was in a space of deep gratitude. I have never met Laura and yet her presence is so amazingly ""present"". Being able to hold anyone naturally creative, resourceful and whole, to be able to love enough to be fully present, curious beyond measure and to trust that all is always perfect as it is, and yet being bold enough to tell the truth when truth is not obvious, is a gift !    I want to become a co active leader because it is the right place to be - at service to others so they can grow as human, emotional, spiritual and professional levels.  It is truly whole.     It is a crossing edge experience for me as I did not go through the audition 3 years ago in Paris, (two weeks after my husband left after 28 years of what i thought was a perfect marriage ) and yet, I trust that it is by crossing these edges, being brave enough, by feeling the fear (and do it anyway) that we can help our clients do the same.

Short background :  Hatty has lost her husband two years ago from cancer and is raising her two daughters being a full time artist.  She started this new career soon after her loss and stepped in supporting the family fully.  She has done 2 exhibitions since which have been helping her pay the bills.     Her coaching was about being a "" Successful Artist"".   Hatty was very down and drained when I met her. I chose to focus on where Hatty was. I wish she had been in a better ""coaching mood"" but she was not. I coached from there.   What I did well was that I used the cornerstones by holding Hatty naturally resourceful and whole while dancing in the moment. Using curiosity I started by asking her to rate on the scale of 0 to 10 how she was rating herself at the moment as. successful artist and what she believed would a 10 look like. I articulated few times what was going on, and found out that she needed a ""breakthrough"" ...zooming up ""......she said ! ...Grooming, PR and PA""   I used intuition few times especially when i could feel a glamorous Hatty and a drained one did not match. There was something unnamed so I dismissed some very subtle saboteurs which were coming out, did not named them, just pushed them away while Acknowledging Hatty ...(I know your work is amazing !) ...few powerful questions included ""What does Hatty needs to become to be HOT"" ?   There was so much dissonance, that I was geared to take her towards fulfilment with value work  And yet, the coaching process took me towards her ""looking and playing with her toes"" ....so I stayed there, taking her where she has chosen to be and that is ...engaging without being engaged . I called her forth as she was escaping in a different direction sabotaging herself....""commit to your toes, stay with your toes..""I said. ... And used again curiosity with her, wiggling her toes.  I was listening, watching what was happening in the space. Calling forth Hatty, challenging her with "" what stopping you ? ...,safe and courageous, I took charge and chose to put the saboteur away by saying "" put the work on the side right now"". I finally got Hatty  in a more playful mood when connecting to her toes. Shift happened !   ""Groomed ! She said ! ....over PR and over PA ....Looking after herself was what was needed to happen"" !   When I ask Hatty what her commitment to spend DHS 1000 on her would mean ""to her""....she said it would give her a "" lift""...I used that ""metaphor"" to get her up from a sitting position to a standing, tall position using a change in physiology. She felt immediately more alert, taller and is that when she claimed "" her new shoes"". ....Which would help her to "" walk tall"", proud and hot ! And Successful !     What could I have done better ?  I could have taken Hatty deeper few times  - when she said : It can be done....  And when she said "" groomed ! ....Or drained myself out ...which would have taken the coaching to a different process work.   I missed opportunities to do deeper process work.  Matching my voice with her tone of voice would have created more intimacy. And slowing down the process would have given Hatty a deeper experience.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
