Level 1 response: : <br /><b>It is incomplete for me. I failed my first audition, and then went on to devote much of my life to bringing Co-Activity into the world, even to the point of co-teaching CTI approved coaching courses at John F. Kennedy University. I am one of the most experienced Supervisors, and a very experienced CPL. But there is a magic and a wonder to being a FORL and inducting people new to co-activity into this amazing world, that I still want to taste. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>One good reason I was put on the Earth this lifetime is to spread the Good News about co-activity. In my writing and co-writing of the last two books (Becoming a Life Coach and The Stake) I did  my best to give my readers a taste of the magic of this work and this world view. I believe I can speak powerfully to that  end in the front of the room, because I have walked this road with dedication since 1999. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

"Excellent, let's put it on the table!" was a bit forced.  I am not used to being recorded, so I showed up nervously enthusiastic.     When he dropped off the line that helped me. When he came back on, I played with the Level 3 "You choked off."  Then I went right into the emotional level of the issue.     I felt it was a fulfillment call at this point, knowing I could also go down the process tunnel, but I felt fulfillment was closer to the issue, in that his newly emerging values were in conflict with his old strategies. His story was resonant, so I didn't feel a need to intrude until I felt he was not being completely truthful.     The dissonance showed up. His saboteur was minimizing how much he had changed from the guy who couldn't handle his divorce.  I tossed out my opinion, and should have made it a powerful question. I backed off from my statement of truth and invited him to clarify. Then I stayed with his "Don't kick the sleeping dog" metaphor as a saboteur strategy.     I used profanity twice and would not do that as a FOTR leader. I used visioning to explore how confronting his ex-wife might impact him. I blurted my strong instinct to take him on: "I want to grab you by the neck".     Then I called forth the values of Phil who is emerging. "Who are you becoming?" Articulated and nailed several saboteurs that came up. (End of 15 minutes). By end of call he committed to designing an alliance with his current partner and committed to call his ex-wife and ask for what he needed.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
