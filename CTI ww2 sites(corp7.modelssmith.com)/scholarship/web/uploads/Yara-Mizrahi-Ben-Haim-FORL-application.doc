Level 1 response: : <br /><b>To be honest-I feel that I am your best choice for this role. In every single course I've been the leaders consistently told me that I should be a FORL. They knew long before I did what it takes and saw it in me. Thanks to leadership I can see it too.  I have an ability to create shift into transformation in a full room. I had the pleasure in doing that for the past two years with groups I lead in Israel. They keep telling me how deep their experience of transformation. I also know I'm a great coach and supervisor, and I'm very sure with my ability to train and guide people to become great coaches.    I am fierce, bold AND loving and compassionate. The seed was planted almost 10 year ago in  Fundamentals and now it is a tree full of fruits waiting to be picked and served to others. I am so ready for this, my heart is bursting and pounding and sweet -spicy ripening for this..   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>There is a gathering of energy around the world, a dance of cultures, spices, colorfulness. Something about getting together around the big fire, an ancient wonder that wants to become new again. There is a need, a thirst to transformation of connection  every where- countries, organizations,families .Cti is part of the quantum leap of humanity into the co-active connection. I know that my life purpose is all about peace and connection, and I feel this is a call from universe to my soul to show up and participate. There is a synergy between my level 1 and the level 3.   There is also something about level 3 that calls out for bold and courageous  FORL's, who can challenge and call forth the coaches to become even bolder. To bring qualities of leadership into their coaching, that will eventually catalyze the human leap process.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

I had no previous contact with this amazing client, I deliberately searched for a client who has no cti background, so she won't make it "easy" on me. In the level 3 there was a lot of curiosity which enhanced my ability to ask many powerful questions. I also created from what she brought into the space (words, feelings) and from my intuition. I think 2-3 questions were a bit too long, though. There was a lot of dancing in the moment which took her down and up the tube. I offered her a metaphor (the band) that was right on for her and it deepened her learning of her emotional experience (she will take her daughter's rubber band to her big trip).In the level 3 there was full permission for both of us: for me to fail and for her to play along with me. We co-created safe space to play, dance, feel and express her needs and emotions. I was also very aware to her use of tone and choice of words and I kept reflecting and mirroring it to her. I think that one time it didn't  really "land" for her. I could have tone it down a bit. Later on (not in this segment) we used a lot of geography. The two main principles that I used were Balance and Process. We were both diving into were ever she was in the moment, exploring and witnessing the colors, the feelings, not running away from the sadness and the darkness. Staying and expanding the moment. Doing the work of process allowed me to move her forward into the work of balance, and she named the current perspective (the Sheriff) and moved to choose a different perspective that serve her values and needs better (the rubber band). It could be more affective if I gave her more time exploring more perspectives.  It was effective when she brought the perspective that felt most accurate to her in a blink of an eye. After listening few times to the call I would slow down a bit my pace of questions and give more space to silence. Over all, I feel it was a very good coaching session- I emailed her few days later- she slept like a dog after our call for the first time in two weeks. I feel fulfilled with my work.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
