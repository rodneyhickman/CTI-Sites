Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Deep inside people are desperately looking for a meaning in their lives, want to be fulfilled in their relationships and do not know how to achieve it. Co-active approach provides "know how" to it in the midst of the world whirling around like crazy. It is just high time for us to stop fool ourselves and choose right actions.

The work concentrates on Process. Using metaphors of the mouse in the box, the wall ...helps her get closer to her feelings. Acknowledgement concerning her increased awareness  of what is going on within her body encourages her to stay with her feelings here and now. Thanks to it later on she realizes what she avoids in her life.  When she starts moving, the work touches Balance:  the new perspective arises . The question: What is needed here? leads her to listening to the space around, more movements, looking for new perspectives in the way she has dressed herself this day (her intention for the day was already there with her): colourful pullover, and in  the space around (picture behind the armchair, that she found supporting) and the returning theme  of Africa - the need for openness, independence, stability (Fulfillment).  Later on she realizes that by constantly changing a lot in her life she stays in her comfort zone, escapes taking responsibility for consequences of her actions (her impact on others).  Returning to the topic of the session (the relationship) with the question:  how does it apply ...? (taking charge) makes her realize that she wants to concentrate on herself and live according to her values, that are not met in this relationship (Fulfillment). She wants to let go of control and instead of hitting the wall, she feels supported by it (difficulties increase her growth,  maturization, learning). She is learning how to trust herself. She wants to take care of the  delicate and vulnerable seed inside her. Noticing the gremlin and not fighting with him make her become curious about herself and foster further discoveries: the will followed  by her commitment to  practice being centered and grounded in herself.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
