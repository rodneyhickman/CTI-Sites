Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I believe with my whole heart that FORL is the next powerful step on the path of my destiny and I am the next generation of CTI's leadership.    My path became illuminated on day 2 of Fundamentals when Michelle McHall came to me with tears in her eyes and told me that she knew I was meant to do this work. That she was crying because she felt it so deeply. Monday morning after Fundamentals, I was inexplicably laid off. 10 months later and the government was paying for my training to become a CPCC. A year and a half later and I was the recipient of an gifted ticket to the Summit from someone I've never met. Next came Leadership, which I completed in December.    Co-Active, CTI and the greater coaching community has transformed my life, my world and my perspective of what is truly possible.

This is a recording of our 1st coaching session together - about 20 minutes total length.    Overall Analysis: Great coaching foundation set; Amazing rapport building - including pacing; Solid use and demonstration of Process Coaching; Clever and insightful homework; room for lots more curiosity with an actual full-length coaching session.    Opening: Solid Foundation Set to begin the Coaching  o	Clearly established coaching topic and set a firm foundation as to what the client wanted and the importance/ reasoning around what was wanted.  o	Had there been more time, there were places to use more curiosity: beliefs around career search "long process"; "this is huge"; finding a "right way to move".    Client declares she wants Clarity: Fulfillment to Process  o	Used a Fulfillment question to launch a Process exercise - "What do you want your end destination, "clarity" to feel like?"    The Process process: Darn good Process (lite) Coaching  o	Decent use of naming what's going on  o	Fail: "What do you know about your solar plexus area?" Question took her into her head and should have been omitted.   o	Good Catch: Talking about dancing = weak sauce. And it was evident. When Lindsay began dancing things got much better.  o	Good Dancing in the moment: When the client articulates that talking has the tendency to take her into her head, for the sake of the client, I ground her in the importance of what we are doing - instead of asking about the importance of what we were doing. Could traditionally be seen as a bad coach move (telling), but for the sake of the client's experience, it was the right move.  o	Great use of intuition: I blurt that I sense she's received an answer to the question I asked, but is dismissing it. And I'm right.  o	Articulating what's going on: Saboteur catch! We didn't have the chance to explore the saboteur, but I caught him and named him.    The wrap up: Great assignment  o	Dancing through the day: Creativly appropriate assignment; client confirms excitement about after I stopped the recording. Could have checked resonance during recording.  o	Fails: Technically should have explained the rules of a request; a few yes/no questions that were a bit of sloppiness vs. bad coaching; and clearer accountability process was necessary.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
