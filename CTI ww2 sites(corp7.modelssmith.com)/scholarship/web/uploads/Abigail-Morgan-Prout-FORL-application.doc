Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My intention is to be well used in this world, to contribute my strengths towards the work of human transformation.  I want to grow myself while growing others, to bring my brilliance to work in service of activating others towards their purpose. I cannot think of a better match for my skill set than training coaches for CTI.       I want to show that CTI leaders can be mothers, too.  As I amp up my coaching business after raising our children, I know what it takes to "get back out there". I understand how to harness the passion, patience and maturity that I have embodied towards specific learning goals.   Co-Activity is a way of life for me - Clive and I base our marriage and raise our family according to Co-Active principles.  I want to use all of what I learn in my Co-Active life as a CTI FORL.    I know what the CTI FORL job entails-I have spent the last 10 years as support leader for Clive as he has crested the steep learning curves of leading for CTI.  I want to participate and play in this evolving conversation on a regular, ongoing basis within a broader (CTI) community.    Finally, to lead workshops for CTI is long-held dream.  I first felt the resonance of the CTI curriculum 14 years ago in 'Fundamentals' in the old San Rafael office.  My life has taken many turns since then; what remains true is my commitment to growth and the Co-Active way.  It is time for me to step into Leading from the Front.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>We live in a powerful time.  We need to wake up to the profound opportunity we have now to create a future to match our deepest longing and boldest dreams.  We need to become agents in redirecting humanity's current path from self-destruction to sustainability. Right now the world desperately needs communities of individuals who are aware that their personal evolution is correlated to growing global consciousness. CTI offers a path for this awakening.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Leading within organizations requires a heightened sense of social intelligence. It requires that one be finely attuned to the relationships and behavioral norms within the room and throughout the wider organizational culture. And it requires that one quickly gain fluency in the particular language idiosyncrasies of the organization (the acronyms and buzz-words).    In some senses going into a new corporate environment is a bit like traveling to a foreign land where you don't know the language and expecting to function as a leader. I first did this when I visited Denmark as an exchange student at 17. This developed my social intelligence as much as my Danish. I have continued to develop this skill with frequent geographical moves. I have lived in six different cities since graduating college in 1994. Each move has required that I attune myself to a new social environment, create new networks and establish myself as a leader again.    Before I had children (6 years ago), I frequently worked as a facilitator and trainer within both non-profit and corporate venues.  Since having children, I have not traveled very much for work.  I have, however, retained several powerful corporate clients (2 Partners of Deloitte, and one Chief Accounting Manager at Bank of America).  Through these long-term and highly effective coaching clients, I have retained my connection to the fast-pace and high-expectations associated with the corporate mindset. My coaching comes alive when I am engaging with a high-powered cooperate clients.  I look forward to re-engaging in person within organizations utilizing the CTI curriculum.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

It is easy to hear how I am holding Angela NCRW while evoking transformation and dancing in THIS moment to do so. There is an overall sense in the coaching that there is no problem to address or fix - that the coaching is simply a process of intimate discovery. My presence embodies the qualities which Angela values (because she knows them in herself and offers them to others) of honesty and gentleness. The empowered relationship is deepened further during this segment at 13 mins when I acknowledged Angela's gratitude at being reflected.     The coaching starts in and develops from the Process principle (through the exploration of the sense of mystery and fear that is keeping Angela stuck at the beginning of the coaching). There is saboteur awareness and management throughout without specifically calling it out. E.g. at  4.20, "I'm no gardener.".   I did not buy into the saboteur voice, but called on the client's deeper wisdom with "As the gardener of the seeds of your heart...." 4.26.   There is a dip into the Balance principle when we reveal two possible perspectives on the seeds (they must be kept safe or they need to be planted) at 7 mins.    All the contexts are present throughout. Most noticeable is the Intuition (e.g. "It reminds me of the pregnancies which didn't flourish" at 6:05), which is driving most of what is happening. My deep Listening at levels 2 and 3 that, together with my Curiosity is fuel for FA/DL. The majority of the movement in this coaching segment is towards deepening learning.     The main skills I am using in this coaching are AWGO, metaphor, acknowledgement and powerful questions. Some examples are:    AWGO: e.g. "one of the seeds wants to be planted in a new job. That is what your deep intuition knows...Can you hear that?" at 10.00. Also "This tension is occurring right now" at 5.15.    Metaphor: the seeds metaphor that comes from the client and I deepen throughout the coaching.    Powerful questions: e.g. "What surprises you?" at 5.25.    Acknowledgement: e.g. mixed with AWGO "All these seeds are really precious.. They are like your unborn children." At 10.55.    There is also evidence of my willingness to intrude and take charge with "Don't say "But" after that.." at 9:48.    What is next for me as a coach:    What this coaching segment suggests is next for me is:  1.	Use more powerful questions and self-manage more tightly so that more of the wisdom of the coaching emerges through the client's mouth.  2.	Take opportunities to point out the Saboteur to the client, so that she is building the capacity to recognize and manage it herself.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
