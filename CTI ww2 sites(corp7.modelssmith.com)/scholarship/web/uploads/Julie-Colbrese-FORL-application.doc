What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Entrepreneurs. Creative types.  20- to 60-somethings in career confusion.  Individuals who are misunderstood in their workplace.  Co-active coaches in certification.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>About half</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Significant (maybe 25%) of my work is coaching business partners and leadership teams within for profit and not for profit organizations</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes. I am a contract (1099) Executive Coach/Group Facilitator for Vistage International, a global membership organization for business owners and leaders. As a Vistage Executive Coach, Group Chair, I facilitate monthly peer group meetings and coach members on a 1-2-1 basis throughout the month.   In addition, I am a new Chair mentor, trainer and speaker for Vistage.  Vistage represents about half of my business/time (approx. two weeks/month). At times it has been more; at times it is less. I value and appreciate the relationship -- primarily because it offers me the opportunity to utilize my co-active coaching skills within a well-established model & brand to reach executives within organizations.  In the addition, the flexibility allows me to take on other work and maintain a ""portfolio career"" that keeps the work and the relationships fresh and interesting for me.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Prior to becoming a co-active coach, I was the co-owner of an integrated marketing services firm. I have a strong business background, particularly in marketing, creativity and business development/sales. This experience enables me to go toe-to-toe in a corporate setting with credibility and professional presence.   In addition, about half of my coaching practice (within Vistage and some without) is with senior level executives of businesses and organizations (profit and not for profit) of all sizes and structures from 1M to 1B in revenue. I am very comfortable in this environment</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I believe CTI would be better served if the role of the front of the room leader was expanded to emphasize a responsibility for service and sales. Front of the room leaders are your best, most highly visible and most direct marketing tool for your brand.   I understand this and am, in many ways, uniquely qualified to help shift that culture and champion the role within CTI and externally.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

However, we do want more language diversity in our leader body and seek those who are multilingual.  We are looking for leaders who are fluent in Canadian French, Parisian French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>Regardless of the outcome of this application, listening to myself coach for the first time since certification has been a valuable exercise. So, thank you for that.   I chose this recording not because it's the best example of my coaching (it's not) but because it represents what I do well consistently and what I do not so well -- hopefully not as consistently and offers a definite place for improvement.  In this example, I do an excellent job of quickly establishing rapport with a new client, putting him at ease and connecting over humor. Secondly, I successfully identify the topic: put this meeting/conversation w/ his work peers behind him. Then, I give him space to ""air out"" his current feelings about this recent work meeting. Throughout, I offer reframing (instead of looking at this one conversation, look at the entire arc of the time between now and the end of your sabbatical as exploration) and help to articulate what is going on (in what ways are you holding an unrealistic expectation/wish that everyone else would stop planning their life/career so you can plan yours?)  I remind him of our topic: put this conversation behind you and re-connect him to his Big A: allowing space to get to his upcoming sabbatical to explore his ""what's next"". Finally, I acknowledge the great relationships he has established with his leadership team and the mutual respect and care they hold for each other.  In the areas of improvement, I would like to see myself take a more active role in the coaching. In this example, I start slow and am listening more than I would like to and too often talk about the topic (head) rather than coaching the client in his deeper understanding (heart/feeling). This client is extremely articulate and I think a more visual metaphor and/or exercise with some physical movement around ""putting his conversation in a box with a circle around it"" would have helped him move on more cleanly.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
