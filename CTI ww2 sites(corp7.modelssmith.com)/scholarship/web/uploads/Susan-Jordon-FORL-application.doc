Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Are you kidding me!   Who doesn't want to be a Front of the Room Leader and have all of those young, starry eyed new Coaches who have just completed Fundamentals idolizing you, looking up at you like you're the next best thing since sliced bread!   I would never have to look for a client again, they would be lining up to work with me just because of my role!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Honestly, I the last few weeks since the announcement of the audition, I didn't think this role was for me as I never felt awe struck by the Front of the Room Leaders as many students have expressed to me during training together and in discussions as Ambassador.   I've felt honored to watch the Leaders Be and model Co-Active relationship, as messy as it was sometimes.    I've also felt such gratitude and honor to be aligned with them when meeting with students during workshop visits as Ambassador and in my role as Ambassador for CTI.   I love being able to share, to model, to represent CTI and all that it stands for.   I feel like this work was made for me - it's who I am supposed to be.   I'm a Connector, it's a strength of mine and when I'm able to make connection with the students, in whatever form that may be, I'm alive, I'm passionate and I know I engage theM in what is Co-Active Relationship and model the skills whenever and wherever possible, in my Program Advisor role as well.  So I've dealt with some self-limiting beliefs to get myself to submit this application and took the time to be Coached and mentored about what this really means to me and why it's so important to me which I will share more on.  This S C A R E S  ME and it makes me F E E L   A L I V E....stepping into a BIGGER ME!  A ME that longs to share the magic of Co-Active with the world and model my humanness, growth, and vulnerability in doing so.    From the day I left Fundamentals I've felt this and shortly prior to completing the core training I wrote in my journal the following, as I had to go back and check:  I am committed to completing the yearlong Leadership program in 2012 after Certification.  I am a Leader and I am following this Co-Active calling in my Life.  I am committed to leading for change, for opportunity, for others to call their best self forward.  I will consider any possibilities that may lie with CTI and being a CTI Leader and Instructor (more discoveries to be done here)...  So why then when this opportunity came forward did I dismiss it or say, no I don't think it's for me?   It's because it means that I will have to stretch, to grow, to put myself out there in a bigger way, in that place of vulnerability... and to acknowledge an area of self-limiting belief and doubt in myself.   Oh, how fun is that living in that place of self-doubt and in contradiction!   And  to what I had envisioned for myself in May of 2011, as shared above from my journaling.  So as I've grown in this consciousness over the past few weeks, had Coaching and mentoring from fellow alumni, it's become oh so clear that...   "No, I'm not waiting, that's not for me.     I've been confused, unsure where to step & I've been mixed up, of course.     So, in Life's great Balancing Act, I'm now sure where to step.    Yes, I will succeed, indeed!    So, Sue Jordon, you're off to Great Places, my Mountain is waiting  & today is my day ...  I'm off and away!"    Oh the wisdom of Dr. Seuss, and what's ironic is I just purchased a Hard copy edition of this book 4 weeks ago, on a urge, that I needed it for me.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>I am available to travel anytime.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>On average during 2013 I have maintained 7 clients.   Coming out of Leadership I had a lot of messed up times, lots of processing which also had an impact on my Coaching practice.   I also took on the part-time role with CTI as Program Advisor which has now balanced itself out where my practice is growing again.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <b>3 this week.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$2000.00</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <b>30%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>during Certification.   I had a goal of having 12 clients by the end of Cert, which I did and earning $2500 per month, which I also met.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>My primary profile is working with Professionals in Career/Business, and young leaders in business.   I'm also quite drawn to working with men who are in mid-life, struggling with who they are Being and what Life is all about.   Really want to run Fundamentals for Men in Vancouver! </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>25%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I do not have a lot of experience.   I have co- led a few workshops for our Certified General Accounts associations, groups of 100 plus.   I have assembled and led Teams for Trade Shows for CTI as Ambassador, as well as my Co-Ambassador Team(s).   I am not a trained facilitator yet am being drawn into this arena more and more and loving it!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>It is all generally through my CTI training.  I did do some Coaching when I was in management positions but nothing with a formality designed around it.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I strongly believe my Business Experience as a Senior Executive, and Leader for the organization I co-founded, and ran for 15 years is a minefield of experience to draw upon.   I am a Business Professional who did not have the support of Coaching and know the ways to lead that are not effective, through experience, and the outcomes they bring.  I also believe my experiences with CTI as a Contactor are areas to draw upon as we model this way of being in Co-Active Relationship and how the skills and tools can be used and draw upon to help us as humans, do our best, and how we can help each other be our best.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I love business, it's a world I'm naturally drawn to which is why I feel I've aligned with CTI currently in the roles I am in.

Hence she's not successful and in inner turmoil about all of that & judgement.     Powerful questions were used, articulating what was going on, using metaphors like an Etch a Sketch, blue sky it, and felt I used range of myself and my energy with my voice.   I acknowledge and championed the client and called her forth.  We identified Saboteurs, named them & client felt where they were taking her out of action.   Requesting at the end, moving into action with brainstorming and finalizing with a Vision Board about her why, and her purpose.     The coaching was mainly Fulfillment with some perspective work, and geography with the either/or perspectives and shifting of my body.  I feel I used language like ""I don't know what's important and I don't know and I would love you"".   This makes it sound like it's about me and could be reframed to point to the client, not me.   It's my intent, yet it pulls it away from the client to me.   I feel it's an excitement part and if I slow down a bit it would be more impactful.   I also do not like the use of the word Honey....it sounds to me, after the fact like I would have preferred to use her name.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
