Level 1 response: : <br /><b>It is part of my life to continue, on a regular basis, to grow as a human being, a leader and a coach. I always visualized, since the beginning of my adventure with CTI, in 2010, that I would be a CTI FORL. This is a must "next step" for me. I strongly believe in my natural resources and capacity to co-lead, specifically when I'm fully embracing my "I'm type" and responsible of my impacts. I'm a mature person, accepting easily any constructive feedback's. I'm not afraid to fall and to try again and again. Being a CTI FORL will help me to grow my personal coaching business: providing in house CTI workshop to the Quebec companies and potential individual clients. It will also at the same time, reinforce my credibility in my role of co-ambassador for CTI and have me promote CTI course with my own community. I want to give back to my community by drawing and co-creating with others a different world, a world in peace and responsible of their impacts.   Finally, at level 1: I honor my life purpose: "calling forth people to unlock their potential to leave their marks in the world". </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I do really enjoy (that create rainbow in my body) that moment when co-leading a workshop, we, the co-leaders, read and smell the space - than, we say at loud what is there, and by expressing opinions or an urge, we bring the group to grow and learn all together. Co-create and co-play with a partner (co-leader), a group and the world, is so powerful - We are one! Every moment, situation, words bring their own colors and learning.   Being a CTI FORL will certainly motivate and inspire not only me, but all the people that I will be able to reach (other coachs-leaders) to knock to the door of business people in Montreal & Quebec, in order to propose a customize CTI program. Our community (CTI leaders and coaches) already feel the urge to co-present a corporate program and I feel it is the time for us to give to the corporate world the taste of a innovative program which will bring leaders, executives, staff to commit to a better collaboration and communication.    Promoting and marketing CTI program in both languages for our community is a must. Actually, our community does not have any CTI FORL to spread CTI programs. It is making sense to have our own CTI leaders talking to their people. The "colors" of Quebec Province (State) are unique and so special.  Goal is to grow and develop more coaches because we are a very young community and as a coach and leader I feel the hunger in the space to move forward.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
