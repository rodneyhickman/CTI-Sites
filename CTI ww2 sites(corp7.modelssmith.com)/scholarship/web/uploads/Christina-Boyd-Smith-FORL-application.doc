Level 1 response: : <br /><b>The chair in front of the room calls to me. Working with talented co-active leaders calls to me. Being steeped in the co-active model calls to me. I've seen the transformation that happens in CTI courses both as a participant and an assistant, and it's amazing. Now that I'm trained in and regularly practice CTI leadership, I want more. Co-leading a workshop leaves me walking on air and bubbling over with love and wanting more for our participants. When I'm leading I see all that's possible and feel on top of the world. I want to experience and lead more of that kind of transformation for others and for myself. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The Level 3 demands that I lead.  Opportunities to lead find me - like the business workshops, workshops in Kenya, and even this application. Feedback from CTI leaders says I'm needed. I have a diverse set of experiences and a global perspective that makes me uniquely qualified to relate to people in business and people from different cultures. You can put me anywhere, and I can thrive and succeed - a boardroom, a rural village in India, a non-profit that serves refugees.... I see the potential for co-active work to travel to the far reaches of the globe in service of the exciting work that is already happening. When I am in front of the room, I can physically feel the heat and pulse of the energy being exchanged between me and our participants. The space wants me to step into that energy and lead.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I spent 10 years working in a large corporation in the highly regulated medical device industry in positions of increasing responsibility. I worked with executives and teams across many functional areas and understand the needs of business leaders. Throughout my 10 years I received high performance ratings and many awards for my work. I am well suited to the fast-paced, business-casual, need-to-see-results culture of the business world. When I resigned from my position and started coaching, the business world found me and drew me back to practice co-active leadership. I now co-lead co-active team workshops for a financial firm. I can speak the language of business. I am funny and quick-witted and quickly create a connection with business professionals.

This segment of the coaching screamed for an acknowledgement, and I missed it. After Choua yelled from the tabletop the space was ripe for an acknowledgement of her courage and the depth of her passion. Such an acknowledgement would have deepened her experience of the risk she took and the elation she felt afterward.    In a few places I edited my urges and fished for the right words. I would have liked to see more blurting and more trust in my intuition, knowing that whatever words come out of my mouth will be the ones that take the client deeper into her learning.    Some of my range sounded wimpy. The inflections "uh-huh" and "mmm" distract from my power as a coach and add nothing to Choua's transformation. When I made a request, I said, "Can you stand on your chair?" Rather, I wish I had simply taken charge, held her NCRW and said, "Stand on your chair."    Now for the good stuff: Choua and I created a strong, empowered relationship that enabled her to overcome her fear and self-consciousness while she took a stand for her passion. Life purpose came alive in this coaching. My range included soft, spacious energy to mirror Choua's natural pace as well as a moment of loud contrast to call her forth and add electricity to the coaching. Choua took that energy and morphed it to her pace and style.    Choua is a thoughtful, spacious person whose power is in listening to her core and allowing herself to take up the space she deserves. I had to employ strong self-management to create a slow and thoughtful atmosphere for Choua to see and experience the power in her natural way of being.    When Choua's saboteur kept trying to derail her before she could commit to a request, I used my humor to call attention to her saboteur without giving it much energy.  I held Choua to her accountability until her saboteur piped down, and she moved forward.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
