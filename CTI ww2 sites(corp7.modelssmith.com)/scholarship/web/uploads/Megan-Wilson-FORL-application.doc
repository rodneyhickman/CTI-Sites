I AM type: : <b>Intelligence / Eccentric</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>The "Front of the Room" is where I belong. It is where I am most alive, articulate and truly, where I feel most at home. It's why I perform live music on big bright stages with big bright bands, and it's why I run workshops and train teams. It's why my "bumper sticker" in a recent team-building exercise I was leading read: "Have flip chart... will travel!"      Maybe it's in my blood. My mother raised five kids in a step-family and while she hated missing the occasional soccer game or choir concert, she always loved her work at the front of the room and included us in her passion for it. As a teenager, I barely understood how remarkable it was that she was dancing her way through corporate leadership until she retired as the Senior VP of Organizational Development for a major international grocery chain, the only woman on their International Executive Committee and perhaps most remarkably - entirely and authentically her joyful, crazy, creative self. "I just followed my bubbles of excitement," she would tell us.     Learning, Growth, Freedom, Challenge, and Contribution. Those have been MY bubbles of excitement and they have led me to some incredible adventures. As an Intelligence / Eccentric type (my tribe argued mightily over which one I was - a sure sign of a shape-shifting Intelligence I was later told), I delight in the facilitation of tough definitions and discussions. I find myself drawn again and again to the chaos and electricity of real-deal, life-transforming, full-of-potential Learning.    At its very best, Learning shatters, leaps, seeps and explodes through a good workshop or seminar - though naturally we try to pin it down with an agenda that will keep things on track. And if the learning is real, the agenda will almost always go to hell at some point, but when we stay and  keep dancing with it, suddenly the group is lighting up, waking up, and getting all shook-up and that's when I feel my ""Big Gold Heart Gong"" - the warm resonance of my whole being saying, ""YES! This is what I was put here to do."     So. Level-1-deep-desire-for-real: Why do I want to do this? Why does this excite me? As usual, the values tell it all: Learning, Growth, Freedom, Challenge and Contribution. As a Front of the Room Leader, I would be honoring my deepest values (anyone who loves learning knows that teaching is yummiest way to do it, especially when you let go of knowing-it-all), and teaching this amazing model with groups of other hungry learners would be a bellows to my passion for, and commitment to, the power Co-Active Coaching.     I've been watching CTI for almost ten years as a loyal fan and groupie, and ever since Rick Tamlin pulled me aside to say, "When are YOU going to be at the front of the room?," I've been waiting for this opportunity.    No one else has a curriculum as powerful, complete and cutting edge as CTI's, and no one else has the same level of impact.     Right now, CTI is the most badass rock band on the planet, playing its most important tour ever, and I'm ready to put on my black stilettos, grab the microphone and join the show.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>"This. Is. Very. Important. Work."    Those were the only shaky words I could muster at the closing circle of my Fundamentals course. I was in between "real jobs," after leaving a torturous but highly educational experience in Corporate America, and had given up a full scholarship for an Masters Degree in Creative Writing to pursue a Spiritual Warriorship program in Martial Arts where most of our training occurred in the backwoods of Maine - a decision that my parents smiled at through very worried eyed.     I had been thrown off the rails and put back onto them by the grace of God so many times, I really wasn't sure which side I was on but my big brother Devin - a CTI-trained coach himself, paid for my course assured me: "You've BEEN a Coach your whole life, Meg... you might as well get paid for it."     The training was powerful, of course. I was completely in love with the Leaders and while I was intrigued in the model, I didn't necessarily see how I fit into all of it since I was sort of irritated with half of the group and envying the rest. And then we came to the closing circle.      As I sat and watched each flawed and terrified and brilliant participant open their mouths, their hearts, and their souls with such incredible courage and willingness, I could feel something powerful blooming inside of me.    "This. Is. Very. Very. Important work." It's all I could say. "I am complete."     In almost 10 years of Coaching and teaching Coaching skills, I have never forgotten that message. It has been the solid ground I've returned to after every failure and fuck up and disappointment in running my Coaching business: This is very important work.      In a world that is undeniably in the midst of an incredible transformation, we Co-Active Coaches and Leaders are critical to determining in which direction that transformation moves. We are willing to call out the lie - the illusion that "they" and "them" are to blame. We're willing to take responsibility for our experience and to choose the risk of fulfillment over the alluring poppy dust of status quo. We're willing to make fools of ourselves if it means someone will wake up to their calling and purpose! We are willing to get over ourselves to and stumble and fall - LORD KNOWS we have all stumbled and fallen in the name of this process, this paradigm, this way of being and doing that is so hard to pin down and that's what makes it so necessary.     Why do I want to do this, Level 3? Because unless we start teaching leadership that includes heart and courage and integrity, we are just spraying mist at a raging fire, and honestly I'm tired of spraying mist. I've worked with education leaders, non-profits, and social justice organizations and nowhere is there more potential to change the world than by injecting these skills - these ways of being - into our mainstream leadership and corporate systems. The potential and possibility makes me jittery with excitement.    I see myself representing CTI at the Front of a Room of powerful leaders. I'm holding the space. I'm present with every cell of my mind, body and spirit. I'm doing whatever it takes. And I'm buzzing with the potential of this thrilling possibility:      That we may all learn to dance around our saboteurs.   That we may all honor our purpose in the world without apology.   That we may all learn how to choose a more supportive perspective.   That we may all learn to listen deeply to one another and to ourselves, and   that we may all make fulfillment, joy and contribution our measures of success.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Professionally, I am currently training and teaching coaching skills at a large healthcare organization in Maine (MaineHealth) and have been for over 2 years.

The contexts were also present, though Curiosity was probably the strongest, and Intuition the weakest. Overall I could have taken the reigns to push faster though I was mirroring his pace which seemed effective in creating safety and trust.     This clip begins with our exploration of the tightness, where I ask "What is the tightness saying?" and his response is... "Of course it's back." Good calling out of saboteur, and could have followed with a Powerful Question i.e. "What's the truth about your heart?"     My leading question about removing tightness would have been more powerful by keeping it short and open: "How would you like to remove it?" My comment, "Very safe, I love it" made light of his courageous vulnerable exploration and wasn't great self-management.     Good naming what's happening: "Not as constricted." I could have followed it with a good Powerful Question i.e.: "What's possible when your hearts not constricted?"    After his "Sweet and Dandy"comment I could have courageously stated, "You're avoiding Sweet and Tender". I was playing it safe and as a result started working too hard to get it right and make him feel okay. Then he got confused and pulled way out of the moment.     Good clean authentic acknowledgement, 'It's one of my favorite parts of you".    Good distinction: powerless and passive vs. sweet and tender. I let him reiterate it in his own words and could have followed with another powerful question i.e. "How would being powerfully sweet and tender serve your project?"    Good interruption and acknowledgement of his powerful and tender self and then I ruined the tenderness by rambling on way too long about how powerful tenderness is!   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
