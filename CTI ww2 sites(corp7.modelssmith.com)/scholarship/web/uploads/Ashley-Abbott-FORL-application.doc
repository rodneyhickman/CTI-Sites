Level 1 response: : <br /><b>One of the major impacts of the CTI curriculum has been to bring me more ""out into the world"", and I intend to keep putting myself out there to see how far I can go.  I keep getting called on this in my Leadership tribe, that there's something ""in me"" to let out: ""We're only seeing the tip of the iceberg, you're a natural!"" and I'm often reminded by others of the popular Marianne Williamson quote (""... Your playing small does not serve the world..."").    People say that if you really want to learn something, then teach it. This has certainly come through in my practice - I've learned unexpected lessons from my clients, and I can only imagine what I might learn as a FORL.    I also love travel, which is part of why I left the corporate world to choose a more meaningful and independent vocation with an aspect of contribution to people's lives, rather than just management of people, projects and resources. I'm building a more flexible life that allows me to seize opportunities for experiences more readily, even though it has meant certain sacrifices in lifestyle. I chose to attend the Leadership course in Spain rather than here in North America, and that has brought me to a wonderfully diverse tribe that has touched me deeply.  Even locally    I have noticed moments while leading meetings, discussions or sessions, when I feel like I'm ""shining"". It sounds odd, but something that I'm taking as a clue or a pointer towards my path.    Not to gloss over the more practical aspects of applying: being a FORL leader could help me in my own practice and life with deepening credibility and additional income, in a flexible manner rather than tying myself to a desk with computer cables.  This is a rare  opportunity to engage in part-time work with lovely people who are ""up to something"" all over the world - how could I say no to such a privilege?!    I'll end this section with two quotes, posted on my wall, which have guided me in recent years:    ""The moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves as well. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A stream of events issue from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen accidents, meetings and material assistance that no one could have dreamed would come their way. Whatever you can do or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.""  - attributed to Goethe; though Scottish mountaineer W.H. Murray, wrote most of it    ""Making mistakes is a lot better than not doing anything."" - Billy Joe Armstrong, musician  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Part of my coaching practice focus is summed up by these words: ""Work doesn't have to be miserable"" and ""Collaboration doesn't have to be about convincing others, nor difficulty, nor battle,"" and ""Leading isn't about power and authority.""  In my 20 years in the corporate world, again & again, the most effective & lasting change I've seen in people & teams has had an element of opening the heart, seeing others, and seeing problems as things faced together (rather than to be broken into bits & assigned to individuals). I believe that Co-Activity is the best model I've experienced that allows for this transformation to take place. It's so widely applicable, and I think the world needs championing to move forward.    I believe people are looking for new excuses to connect, to turn towards something more for themselves and for others than is offered by their current lives and workplaces. Perhaps this is what eventually led me out of a regular corporate life - not simply to escape its obligations, but to have the opportunity to make a bigger difference in people's lives than it allowed me to do (even though one of my most rewarding positions was Consulting Practice Manager, which oversaw the personal development, evaluation and assignment of consultants).  I've taken my own development seriously, which hasn't always been easy or fun, but certainly enriching and worthwhile. I feel a sort of responsibility to people who are becoming leaders and teammates, to share what I've learned about managing, coaching, listening; about Co-Activity.    One of my mentors once said about conflicts that ""the person with the greater awareness has the responsibility to act."" At first I resented the extra work, it seemed unfair.  Now I see it as an opportunity: what a better world we might live in, if we have -more- people who are -more- aware, and taking responsibility to act accordingly?  Is that fantastic?  Becoming a FORL offers the chance to be part of a local community, as well as be connected to the world at large, to many others doing similar work. For me, this has been the heart of the Leadership program - and I'm only half way through.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>At this point, fairly flexible. 2-3 times per month?</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <b>2-3 times (could be more)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <b>Yes, in general.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <br /><b>Yes, I'm very familiar with Paris, London, Barcelona in particular. I have Canadian and UK passports.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>It has been 5-6 clients, primarily because I was finishing a near full-time corporate project management contract (started while completing CPCC) which funded my participation in the Leadership program. This affected my availability to pursue more clients. I'm currently in a practice growth phase, now that the contract has concluded. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>Four - I started a new one this week as well. (It was a short week due to Canada Day & July 4).</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>Approximately $1000 (excluding contract work)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>Perhaps 15% including consulting (non-coaching) income.  I have just increased my rates, and don't intend to take on additional non-coaching consulting work.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>In 2011.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>I focus on ""new managers and their leaders"", though I'm also working with 3 coaches as clients (two not trained by CTI), the dean of a school of a Canadian university, a bank employee looking for more meaningful career/life, and a man working in increasingly senior roles in a North-America-wide retail company.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>Currently, about 50% or more.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>The most specific example is co-leading a group of 29 women and 1 man which was the entire team of Ovarian Cancer Canada, a national not-for-profit agency.  I worked with an ORSCC coach to lead sessions (Lands work, goals, strengthsfinder types, etc.)   In general, I've spent 20 years in the enterprise software business, leading teams in various capacities (e.g. project implementation teams on client site including client team members, leading groups of account teams, managing a consulting practice of approximately 45 consultants, led small ""Client Success Team"" of 5 to serve sensitive account relationships.  I also formed a digital marketing agency with four partners, I was the general manager.    All of these roles involved working 1:1 and with the group to produce results and address issues, though the most sustained coaching-focused work was while leading the consulting practice and account teams.  I've also been consulting to Project Management Offices (PMOs), and formed & co-led a ""Coaching Circle"" of about a dozen coaches during the Intermediate curriculum, to provide an opportunity to practice coaching with each other.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I've attended various seminars at the Toronto ICF chapter, as well as some management training provided by consultants to companies I've worked for, but nothing  part of a formal curriculum.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>OCC 2-day workshop for entire organization of 30 (see question E8 above). Team discovery, dynamics, lands work, goals,     PMO (project management office) brief best practices seminars in 2 organizations    ""Talk the Walk"" - co-leading outdoor seminar near Mt Fuji, Japan (July 21) with Japanese translators. Stake: ""Nature is essential to inner wellbeing.""    I'm currently working on some ""Entrepreneur Development"" modules for use with a company accelerator/incubator organization.    I've led numerous PMO and project meetings in the workplace, as the usual convenor.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>Nope.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have a particularly involved corporate background, having spent about 20 years in the enterprise software business, primarily in client-facing roles. This involved working in many different client corporate cultures, while reconciling client needs with my employer's expectations.  I've been asked consistently to lead teams and small organizations in all of the companies I've worked for.      One of the delicate aspects of ""professional services"" work is needing to influence people I depend on for success (e.g. client contributors) even though I had no direct authority over them.  It helped me form the belief that relationships are the foundation for success. I believe that having a pre-existing constructive relationship with someone forms a solid base for overcoming the inevitable conflict and disappointment that occurs in business (and technology projects in particular).    I've experienced both success and failure, both as a corporate employee, and having my own agency / business with partners, which gives me an appreciation for the strains, politics and demands people face at various levels in a company (e.g. skilled contributor, project manager, Director/VP or decision-maker level).     Working as employee, consultant, and as a coach has illustrated to me the difference between consulting and coaching (which at times demands self-management to keep the inner consultant/fixer under control!)  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I really feel for people in business, leaders and their teams.  I myself have taken the tough road of burning myself out at least twice, until I started seeking out a better way to be. I learned that entertainment wasn't always the antidote to overwork. I learned that connections with people were more important and rewarding than I'd realized - both personally and professionally.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

In addition to English, what languages do you speak? : <br /><b>I speak French (mix of Canadian & Parisian - it's really mostly the accent and some expressions that differ, much like UK vs. American English).  I visit Paris about 3 times a year, as I have a bit of a base there. I speak some Spanish, which is improving each time I go to Sites for a retreat.

Being in the diplomatic corps is part of Rachel's ""big agenda"". She has identified ""Eeyore"" as one of her saboteurs, as well as some guides: Grandma, her list of ""bad-ass women"" that she created as previous homework, and the image of herself in a power suit & heels.    Critique    I feel this was primarily Process coaching, in personal life vs. business.    On the downside, I took too long to get to the real topic in the session. At times, I injected too much interpretation into the dialogue. I could have had us ""stay in the process moments"" longer to actively notice & feel them more, and let insights arise.  I had some long articulations, and perhaps worked a bit too hard, rather than just being curious by using simple questions.  Although I wanted to have an appropriate pace to allow space and being, I allowed some stories to go on for a while - I could have interjected to get a bottom line, and succeeded with a shorter session.  I could also have varied the pace a bit more and offered more acknowledgements.    On the upside, I think there were some good examples of articulation and noticing of geography (e.g. heaviness).  I used metaphors, and although I suggested some (e.g. boa constrictor) I allowed her to choose her own word (clamp). I spoke my own L1 when tears came to my eyes, and left lots of space for her to feel her way forward, while really being there with her.  I reframed an uncomfortable situation by asking what she could appreciate about her aunt's point of view. There were some good open questions (How do you want this to work out? What is important to work through?) and we identified what she wants: a solid family unit, including a good relationship with her aunt.  This pointed her towards a diplomatic role in the family (which we later linked back to her big agenda).  I threw in some intuitive words (e.g. control), and supported with some acknowledgement (she is succeeding) - a ""being"" moment.  She identified her own saboteur at play (Eeyore) as well as ways to help him out (reassure him & break down the problem) which shows she is becoming self-sufficient at managing her saboteur.   Later in the session (beyond the recommended clip), we got to some acknowledgement, championing, called up some guides (30:10), some actions (find a confidante 34:10) and ended with the inquiry ""What is diplomacy in family?"" (36:20) and ""What will you do?""  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
