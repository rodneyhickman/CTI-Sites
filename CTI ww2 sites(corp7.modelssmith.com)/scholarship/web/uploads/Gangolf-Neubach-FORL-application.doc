Her voice sounds nervous and excited. I heard this. But something took me away to articulated it. I did not want to dive into a problem in this coaching environment immediately. (It sounds for me that she was nervous because of the situation). First I asked her about the positive experience with the group. This took probably to long. The "real topic" was still sitting in the background.   So I asked her about the women. Her voice had a different tone and as she was talking about her step father, something deep open up. I articulate the laughing. Her mood changed. First she feels freedom but then I heard  a  deep-drawn sigh. I picked this up. It was the feeling of her sadness during her childhood. It sounds deep. I mentioned it but I did not want to go deeper. (If it would be an old coaching relationship without recording probably I would have gone deeper but this could be the border to psychotherapy.)  Asking her about the laughing her intentness to go her way came up. I tried to amplify this.   At the end my language may be cause some misunderstanding.  But we could finished with her feeling of freedom.  Challenges:  long questions, with to much words and a little bit spluttering, not native language  more acknowledgements possible  to shy to go deeper in this situation  to long in the beginning with the topic "group" which was focused by me not by her.  Strength:  following her she felt connected to me (she mentioned later)  listing level 3: the laughing, the sadness, the freedom, the decisiveness  articulating what I am hearing  focus the person, not the issue (the women)        Remark: You asked for my best coaching. I do not think that this recording is my best coaching. But I ve just received the possibility to apply for FORL via Christiane Wild. It is difficult to find a client who is a new coachee, talks in English and accept to be recorded. So I take this record because I won't be able to record another one.  I do not have the Leadership and I am only ACC.
