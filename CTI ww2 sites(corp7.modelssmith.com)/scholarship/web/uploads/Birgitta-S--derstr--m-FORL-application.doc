I cannot say it represents my best coaching - however, I think it shows that the model still works and the client will have deepened awareness and transformation.    I suggest listening to the mid-15 minutes of the mp3 file.    One of the major things that work well is the designed alliance, the space is one of total trust. In this coaching session the client is given total trust to explore and find her own answers. The coach is asking powerful questions and the client is also displaying trust in the coach and the process by being honest, vulnerable and daring to look deeply into herself for answers.    There is a lot of curiosity, intuition and dancing in this moment as the client is discovering and exploring.    As the coach I felt a bit of a failure in self management where the coach (me) is questioning ""why"" the client is looking for safety and economical stability from outside herself (when client is expressing the 'need' of a man to provide this safety) however, I think I recover by giving the client the inquiry about safety and how to add more of this in her life. I also see that I as the coach truly believes in the client to be creative, resourceful and whole when her saboteur is taking over. Another failure was that I did not point out the presence of the Saboteur - and point to the magnificance of the client.    Some powerful metaphors are used that beautifully symbolize the feeling felt by the client. The coach (me) is articulating what is going on and is acknowledging the client. The coach is holding the client's agenda and intruding when the client is slipping out of ownership and empowerment (as when she is claiming that 'this is how it is in China').    I am missing bigger championing and would also like to see some embodiment since it would have deepened the experience of process, especially when the client is talking about ""drowning"" in feelings of despair - the embodiment would have taken the awareness to a deeper level.    Witnessing and being with is clear throughout this session. The coach and client are very much in the 'same' energy which is moving and changing throughout the session.  The energy is somewhat heavy with a certain feeling of helplessness when the client is expressing her feelings of despair, depression, loss & need etc.  There is visible transformation at the end where the client is showing higher energy and resonance about exploring more about how she can add more safety in her life, from within herself.    The coach would be more powerful if ""i"" would use ""I see"" instead of ""I think"".    Even if this is not my most powerful coaching I am very happy to witness how the co-active model WORKS and what a gift it is to the client (and always to me/the coach as well) - every time. It is bigger than me/the coach.
