I AM type: : <b>Danger</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I still remember walking into my Fundamentals course six years ago and being thunderstruck by the fact that there were TWO leaders at the front of the room. Before the course even started I pointed up at those chairs and said to myself ""I want to do THAT."" It only took me half a day of Fundamentals to fall in love with Co-Active work and this incredibly compassionate, responsible and transformative way to be in the world.     Quite simply, I LOVE the work that CTI does and I was born to ""Co"". I've led a lot of things on my own and vastly prefer the magic and impact that two Co-Active leaders can have on learning in the room--modeling dancing in the moment, authentically leading "on-type" and the power of spontaneous co-creation for the sake of a shared stake. I am on fire at the thought of dancing with the caliber of leaders that have taught me my craft! And I relish the deepening of my learning it will mean to teach the Co-Active model to others.     I am a generous and "all-in" co-leader. I delight as much in empowering another's leadership as I do in boldly taking charge or silently holding space. My hunger for learning and my commitment to the shared stake always overrides my 'ego' resistance to feedback or a need to be right.    Twenty years ago, when I taught English as a Second Language in Italy, I fell in love with what I call the "wow moment"--that almost audible "pop" when a student shifts from thinking they can't do something to realizing that in fact, they can. Coaching for me is a potent distillation of this "wow" moment. To train others to be coaches themselves distills that elixir of possibility and empowerment to an even more intense level.  My face lights up just thinking about facilitating and witnessing all that Co-Active "wow"!      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The space I create invites others to play, get messy, and feel safe doing it. When I show up as a leader, I give people a natural sense of invitation--to dance in the moment, to risk, and to willingly go to the "scary" places within themselves. In my experience leading transformative learning experiences, one of the most important things I bring into the space is the permission to self-express, experiment and "fail" in the name of learning. I believe this is exactly the kind of impact that FORLs need to make to successfully enroll and train Co-Active coaches.     My natural essence delightfully tempts people to question assumptions, dream big, and boldly claim who they are. I embody fun, creativity, curiosity and wonder. My inner trickster loves to call out "the emperor's new clothes" and remind people that they still have all the passion, freedom and resourcefulness that they were born with! My genuine love of people, coupled with my natural ability to hold a big, safe space for them to grow into their potential, mirrors what I experienced with the FORLs during my own CTI training.     When I found CTI, I found somewhere to call home--and a way to be in the world that resonated deeply and completely with my values. I also found a passionate, provocative community committed to humanity's highest potential. I became a CTI Ambassador a year and a half ago to help build and grow this community in my home town. I am honored to step up and take an even greater part in the spreading of this amazing work as a FORL. I am thrilled--and humbled--at the number of lives I can touch, teaching the  Co-Active "magic" from the front of the room.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

I keep her in her body, out of her head, and in her true nature of playful wackiness. The Process principle not only resonated deeply with this highly creative client, it also side-stepped her rather "heady" Saboteur. There's a feeling of spaciousness and authentic curiosity to the call that gives the client lots of room to explore and embody her process "adventure".     What worked:    I nail many powerful questions that open up the space and allow the client to go to a different place emotionally regarding her situation: What do you wish you could do?; What do your legs want to do?; What isn't here?,  What do you want next?; What's the flavor of that?; What urge is growing in you right now?   My Level 3 intuitive blurt: "OOOooo. There's something! What do you see?" really brought the process alive for her and helped her discover something new and powerful.     I articulate what's going on in several places, notably naming when the "bigness" of the wall/block had become a "bigness" of space/opportunity. In addition, Championing her bolstered her confidence and trust in the process:   Follow that instinct!; Poke it! Awesome, Go for it! Let's try it out! If not here then where?     What didn't work:    A book reference (Dr Seuss) didn't really land, but I was unattached, and it took me to an empowering question: You're the boss! What are you going to do? I also feel that while the pace matched the client pretty well, I could also have moved her along a little more quickly.      There were times when the client had to ask for something to be repeated, or we spoke at the same--which is an opportunity for me to speak more clearly and tune in even more to the level 3.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
