I AM type: : <b>Danger</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Level  1 - What's in it for me?  I understand that there is lots of training for new front of the room leaders once taken into the leader body and that it is an enriching and enlivening community.  Being part of the CTI Leader Community would be a huge opportunity and chance for me to keep growing my skills so that through interactions with other leaders and the experiences with participants, I will be able to constantly work on my edges, to determine what struggles I have with my growth edges, to be aware of where I want to put my attention in terms of my own evolution, and to have me be cognizant of where I repeatedly get stuck and need to shift the pattern.  I have often been asked to be more vulnerable. What I know about where I am growing and how it fits with what is needed now, is that I know that I am growing into my full range and capacity as a human.....I incrementally crawl toward being more vulnerable. I am now much more able to calibrate my Danger Type energy and dance the paradox of calibration while letting my authentic self loose, not being careful, and not stopping myself as that is where I am at my best and really shine through. I am compellingly on type more often than being uncompellingly on type which has needed huge awareness and fidelity to the CTI models to be true. For the most part I wield the "sword of truth" for the greater good and not to slay or intimidate. I am a Danger Type that is finally comfortable in her skin and not resisting it. I am working on wholeness by integration of the shadow side and light side of Danger energy.....yet there is still a long way to go and I feel that being a CTI front of the room leader will be a catalyst and will fast track that process...something which ultimately will be for the benefit of myself and for of all in my sphere of influence.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Level 3 - What's my bigger picture?  I believe in the work that CTI does wholeheartedly!!!!   I am a CTI junkie who has done the core courses, assisted the core courses, done certification, done ORSC courses under CTI, done the Leadership Program, assisted a Leadership Program in Spain and then just recently retaken the core courses again 7 years later, just to be up on current content for use in my coaching practice and life......I have drunk the Co-active "Koolaid".   I have had constant reaffirmation that the CTI Co-active model works and I want to be of service in introducing new people to the model. The Co-active movement needs to spread like a good fungus over the planet and I want to be a part of that bigger outreach and a part of the deeper, faster impact to access more people for transformational change. I am wildly passionate about coaching and I like working with people who are just starting out and new to the curriculum. I feel it would be a delight to guide people through their learning about themselves, others and coaching and to have more transformative conversations with people. The more people the better who are in touch with their life purpose, values, who are at choice, insightful, self-actualized and aware....the more people the better who are living juicy, rich, fulfilling lives in alignment with the CTI Co-active models. We really are contributing to the world being good, true and beautiful!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>January 2006</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>My niche is Legacy Coaching. I work with affluent and successful high net worth individuals such as CEOs, CFO's and Private Bankers and their clients.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>None. My target client is a high net worth corporate executive, however I do personal legacy coching not corporate or business coaching with them.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I did the 5 ORSC courses when Centre for Right Relationship was under the CTI umbrella back in 2007.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>None other than I did the 5 ORSC courses when Centre for Right Relationship was under the CTI umbrella back in 2007.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>1.) I faciliate a monthly woman's intentional conversation circle called ""Pink Pearl Circle"" which 12 - 20 women attend. I pick a ""heart"" not ""head"" topic and generate some powerful questions which are thrown into the space for open discussion. The women are nudged into deep rich authentic sharing with each other and stretch their views of themselves in an enlightening, supportive and empowering environment that I lead. Guaranteed the chatter is always real, sassy, provocative and revealing!  2.) A few times per year, I am hired as a Life Coach to lead a girl's night out workshop called ""Pink Pearl Party"". See my website at www.pinkpearlparty.com for more info. Simply put, this engaging and experiential workshop involves teaching basic life coaching skills, to a group of fun loving gals, who have no interest in becoming life coaches themselves. These life coaching skills are learned and implemented, for the purpose of enriching conversations within their circle of girlfriends, in order to skip pretenses, bypass superficial interactions and to be more authentic with each other. Then, with regular use, these new communication skills allow them to develop deeper, more meaningful, fulfilling and satisfying relationships with all of those who matter most to them, and who they cherish in their life, such as friends, spouses and family. As with all the other revenue generated from my coaching business, all the fees collected from these workshops are donated to charity as part of my own legacy and way of giving back to my community.  3.) For the last 4 years, I was the Chair and Progam Co-ordinator for the West Vancouver Women's Network which is a professional business woman's networking group that holds monthly dinner meetings at the local country club.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I am not going to try and bullshit you, as you can see from my resume, I was a marine biologist for 17 years before becoming a coach so I am way more comfortable on a boat, in gumboots covered in fish guts, than in a corporate boardroom.  However, throughout those years I also developed real estate and invested wisely and took investment risks which paid off very well financially.....much better than my government job. I am now a high net worth individual myself who coaches other high net worth individuals, some of whom are corporate executives and investment bankers. My husband is the CEO of a large North American utility company so I am sure I can draw on his guidance as to proper corporate etiquette.   I ""clean up"" well and promise not to lead Corporate Training wearing gumboots.  In addition to my corporate coaching clients, personally, my lifestyle and social life includes many corporate folks, who under their ""big wig"" titles, I have found are real people with all the joys and fears as any other non-corporate folks would have.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>If I was a crayon I would be the Hot Pink one as I think that it is the color of joy in the universe.  I am easily seduced by beauty.  I tango in authenticity.  The shield of warrioress comes easily to me, while nurturer not so much.  I cordially decline offers to conform.  I would rather walk barefoot through sand than grass.  Give me beat up cowboy boots over stiletto heels any day.  I unapologetically wield the sword of truth.  I believe that rainbows and full moons are good luck symbols.  My totem animal is black jaguar.  I am passionate about the ocean and I feel that I was a mermaid in my last life.  I believe that it is possible to be spiritually aligned and wealthy.  I wish on the first star I see at night.  I move toward what I want rather than away from what I fear.  I detest olives with a passion.  I wear color; color does not wear me.  I am unabashedly a mushy romantic; a total candlelight, wine and roses kind of gal.  My affirmation is "Courage is Fuel".  I don't seek permission or an apology to be who I am.  Abundance is my birthright.  I take every excuse to pop the champagne and celebrate.  I am unafraid to make enemies yet respectful of many voices.  My last boat was named "Calculated Risk".  I always come from kindness yet it does not always look nice.  I lead by living in paradox.  When I find a penny I pick it up, believing that all day I will have good luck.  I feel that the only way out is through.  I dare to live on the edge of my being.  My least favorite smell is ammonia.  I prefer the role of servant to that of the served.  Trusting my intuition has me stand strong in my integrity.  I juxtapose energy and stillness and love to move my body.  I journey with unlimited curiosity.  Gratitude catapults me into my heart and fosters my generosity.  I am joyfully deliberate, intentional, intense, and focused.  I take what serves me and I leave the rest.      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Amping up the Level 3 listening would have allowed me to articulate more fully what was present in terms of asking powerful questions that were creatively generated or formed by being more in the moment, in the coaching. I could have articulated what was going on without the intention of taking it anywhere and also articulated what was not being said using statements and acknowledgements. Through deeper Level 3 listening, sensing and even more self-management to tune into my client, I could have gotten closer to my client's "Big A" agenda and the coaching might have then gone up a notch in terms of strength and this would have given more polish to what was already there. My client was looking at who she was being in terms of her drinking etc. and it was a great opportunity to call her forth in a way that says "I see who you are and what you are up to". For the sake of her aliveness and biggest life I could have asked her questions about where she was selling out on herself or where she was making a stand or standing up for herself or making things happen in a way that she never has before. I could have pointed the client more toward who she is and who she is becoming so that she could really feel the size of herself. As a coach, I feel that I gave away some of my power and needed claim my power to trust what was working or to try new strategies and to feel the size of myself more as well in the call. I could have paid more attention to calling forth magnificence which could have been as short as one line or could have been layered in throughout the call. There was more room in the call for me to express what I was sensing and blurt my intuitions. The tango dance discussed, was a beautiful metaphor that could have been played with more, and embodied in the coaching, in terms of geography. A shift in geography may have accessed insights or created new powerful questions. A different quality of energy may have been available in a different geography and an unusual geography could have been used to uncover and unpack what was needed in the moment.      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
