I AM type: : <b>Danger</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I've wanted to be a front of the Leader since Fundamentals with Lorry Schneider back in 2008. I knew I COULD be one when I watched Helen House in Process; I saw myself in her style and energy. I have a deep desire to express myself fully in my life and that means showing up and stepping up to the front. It scares me, but I feel it in my soul that it is my calling to do so. When I attended Fundamentals I felt like I stepped into another Universe - one that I really resonated with. They were speaking my language; they were scaring the crap out of me; they were exciting me with my own potential. I'm not polished, I'm real and I know people are hungry for that as it allows them to do the same. So why CTI? Because of the people, the leaders and the model - in fact, I have assisted approx 13 times.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I am far from a master coach, but I am a committed learner and self-grower. Nearly 6 years ago I hit the floor and followed my heart into a Fundamentals class. Through the curriculum, my life opened, my heart opened... I started to emerge. I took a big chance and went to Leadership as I felt a strong calling to do so. It ignited me. I completed the process with certification and continue to grow and blend and seek opportunities for more growth... I recall a call with Henry where he put it so eloquently: ""We need to keep cleaning out our own basements... in order to hold space for others to do so."" My Life Purpose statement remains:   ""To Fiercely hold others to their truth and illuminate the possibilities""</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
