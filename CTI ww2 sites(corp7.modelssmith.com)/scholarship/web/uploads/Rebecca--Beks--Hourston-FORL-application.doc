I AM type: : <b>Intelligence (with Wit, Charm & Playful)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Because CTI is quite simply the best of the best in terms of front of room leadership, and I want to be - and be surrounded by, inspired by and learning from - the best of the best.  I have 6 years' extensive experience of co-leading front of room workshops for demanding corporate clients including JP Morgan, KPMG and top tier law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer - and although I always get outstanding feedback on what I bring, I want to step it up a gear.  My deep-seated  Level 1 reason for this application is that I know I will get the best personal development and stretch imaginable, that will take my own leadership, and the difference I can make through it, to fresh heights - and I feel hungry for that.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Firstly, I see a massive need in the world for a coaching approach.  Life, workplaces, communities and parenting thrive when they are co-active, and most people don't automatically know how to do that - they need help to understand what it means for them, and how it can make them so much more effective, and life so much more fun and fulfilling.  My passion is for spreading co-activity in the workplace, homes and world so this level 3 need can be met.  My primary motivator is not necessarily training professional coaches (which I realise may sound odd since that is what CTI FORLs are doing!)  But the need I absolutely see is for the co-active coaching approach to be spread and spread.  Whether that's through people I might train going on to set up their own coaching practice, or whether it's that the skills I would help them gain would go on to enhance their work, lives and other interactions more generally - for me it's less about the method in which they would channel their skills, and more about equipping people with the skills themselves.  So much is spoken and written about coaching nowadays (a big change from when I started 10 years ago) yet still there is a big ""please show me how"" in the Level 3, and I want to help people discover how to coach.     Secondly, the coaching profession needs excellence and high standards in order for it to be well perceived.  Unfortunately, in the Level 3 there can be confusion and distrust about coach training programmes, as frankly there are some terrible ones out there.  It is really important to me that the coaching profession grows in stature and scope, and that can only be done by outstanding training programmes existing.  So there's this need for turning out people who can coach with depth, finesse and brilliance and I would love to be a part of enabling that to happen.    Finally, certainly in the UK, there can still be something in the Level 3 about coaching, and coaching language, being perceived as a bit ""woo-woo"" or fluffy.  It's simply awful if people then close down and refuse to give the ""soft stuff"" any time of day, when actually that is what will make the single biggest difference to the kind of impact they make.  I know I am a good person to counteract that as I have high credibility with those who can be put off (Cambridge University education, corporate management background at cosmetics giant L'Oreal, and 10 years' coaching experience with a wide range of well-known corporate clients).  With a life purpose of being the deep, solid earth that gives roots and makes it safe to grow wings, I naturally bring groundedness, connection, warmth, spark and safety to the room, and the Level 3 of a CTI course room needs those qualities to be present.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Are you available to lead mid-week courses?

Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <b>Yes</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>5-7 in my most recent full year of practice (2011-12).  I have been on maternity leave for much of the last 12 months, having had my third child in June 2012. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>None this week as I am in the midst of a big house move after 13 years, with 3 kids in tow!!  (I am determined to get this application in amongst all that, though!)  In an average week I would have two 1-1 coaching clients, a front-of room lead every couple of weeks, plus office-based design and development time.  I work part-time (2.5-3 days per week) alongside bringing up my young children.    As you will gauge from the details I give elsewhere in this application, my coaching work over the last 7 years has been very much focused on front-of-room leading (my workshops always take an experiential, coaching-based approach, include a fair amount of ad-hoc 1-1 coaching opportunities, and quite often include some 1-1 coaching follow-up with participants).  I deliberately chose to go in this direction having done, and loved, the CTI Leadership program.  In fact, I consciously decided to do Leadership and Certification in that order, rather than the more usual way round of Certification first, as I knew I was drawn more to working with bigger groups than in a 1-1 setting.  That instinct has certainly proved to be true for me, although I do very much enjoy my 1-1 clients too.    I know I might not quite 'tick the box' for you in terms of the typical quantity of 1-1 clients in my practice, but I believe this is balanced by my front-of-room coaching experience plus the type of 1-1 client I have being demanding and high quality, tending to be corporate and senior (and my fee reflects this - eg. I am currently in the midst of a year-long coaching program  for a Director at the professional services firm KPMG to support her through the process of promotion to Partnership, the program fee being $18,000). </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$1700 per month</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>33%.   My income from 1-1 coaching and front-of-room leading has tracked at $90,000 to $100,000 per year for the last 5 years.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2003</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Mid- to senior-level women leaders in organisations who want to improve their leadership, have more impact/presence and/or get a better balance.  I am in the process of focusing even more specifically on part-time working moms, helping them to have more impact in less time.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>90-100%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>* Designed and Co-led (with Tony Barton) a 2-day team coaching program for leading professional services firm KPMG's International Legal team    * Designed and led a year-long group coaching programme for 6 senior women at a Housing Trust (ran this with 2 groups over 2 years)    * Designed and co-led for MSN (Microsoft) Europe a 2-day team coaching programme for 70 of their senior management.

What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>* ORSC Fundamentals (done in Paris, March 2011   * Accredited 'Firework' Career coach (a UK-based program originally co-designed by a CTI graduate)   * No other training program but regular attendance at various professional development seminars, forums, co-coaching events etc.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I've front-of-room led and co-led extensively over the last 7 years (with some gaps to have my 3 boys who are now 6, 4 and 1).  The workshops I run all take an experiential, coaching approach (vs. ""training"") to the topic in question.  I nearly always design as well as run my workshops, using co-active principles.  In the last 2 years, workshops I've run include:    - A 2-day Women's Leadership Development program for KPMG ( I run this approx once/quarter)    - Various workshops at Freshfields, one of the world's top law firms (a one-day conference-style workshop for c.60 global female Partners; Gender Diversity discussion groups; 'Raising Your Profile with Confidence' half-day workshop for female junior associates)     - Several 1-day programs for KPMG's 'emerging leaders' talent pool ('Navigating Organisational Politics' and 'Leadership Style and Impact')    - Numerous workshops for Blue Rubicon, a PR and reputation management agency with clients including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Shell, Kraft Foods, Unilever etc).  I designed and led a bespoke workshop for them called 'Coaching-Based Leadership' which over the last few years I've delivered to all 60 of their senior management team, and have since created further programmes ('A Coaching Approach to Creating Time for Strategy'; 'A Coaching Approach to Team Talent Development')    - Currently running another program I've designed, 'Coaching-Based Consultancy' for a small Digital Media agency that did the Obama re-election e-campaign and is part of the WPP group    - 'Executive Presence' half-day workshop series for JP Morgan    - A year-long small group coaching program for 6 senior women at a London Housing Trust (run for 2 groups over 2 years)    - A half-day 'Coaching Masterclass' for the HR team of a large UK regional law firm, Burges Salmon    - 'Leverage your network' workshop for Linklaters LLP, one of the UK's top 5 law firms    - A number of workshops for senior women, including 'Presence and Impact', 'Your Leadership Network', 'Visionary You', 'Time & Life Leadership' etc  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes.  For the last 7 years I have been closely involved (for much for that time, as the ""right-hand woman"" of the founder/CEO) in Aspire (www.aspirecompanies.com).  Aspire has won various awards and has worked with over 10,000 senior women leaders in the last decade, many of whom I have been privileged to work with myself.  I have the role of Director of Programs for Aspire, and over the years have co-led or solo led 100+ workshops for demanding, savvy participants.  I am an Associate of Aspire (albeit a particularly closely involved one) so I take jobs on a case by case basis, and have full freedom to accept or decline work (ie. I am not contracted in to a set number of hours).  My work with Aspire has primarily given me great exposure as a front of room leader - all the other coaches working with Aspire are also CTI-trained, with several having done CTI Leadership too, and some (Tony Barton and Sandra Richardson, with whom I have co-led, plus Tina de Meeus) being CTI FORLs too - and so the CTI/co-active approach has always guided my front-of -room leading style.      My intention is to continue with the Aspire work over the coming few years (hopefully alongside leading for CTI), as I very much enjoy it and feel it is very aligned with the CTI ethos.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I would love to do this.  I know the corporate world DESPERATELY needs co-activity, and for it to be accepted it has to be carefully positioned so as not to be thought of as 'fluffy' - and I am good at making sure of that!  Having secured a prestigious graduate traineeship with L'Oreal when I left Cambridge University, I spent the first 7 years of my career there in nothing at all to do with coaching/development/HR - instead I was at the 'coal face' of business and marketing, primarily managing leading cosmetics brands ranging from Lancome to Maybelline.  My time there culminated in being appointed Head of Consumer Affairs for L'Oreal UK where I led a large team and sat on a divisional Management Committee.  This corporate background has given me first-hand experience of the stresses and challenges facing busy executives and leaders operating in high-pressure working environments, and time after time has made me well-placed and credible to ""meet them where they're at"".  I am confident and at ease in corporate environments, and passionate about making them places with more heart and fulfilment too.   To me, there's no such thing as work-life balance - it's all one life, and work is a big part of it for most people, so I feel incredibly strongly about helping people make sure that their time at work is enriching and amazing.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>This reference from a corporate client of mine, Blue Rubicon - a PR and reputation management agency with clients including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Shell, Kraft Foods, Unilever etc:    ""Blue Rubicon has traditionally developed all its training capabilities in house. However, when I decided to run a leadership development programme to ensure we supported our senior managers in making an effective transition from management to leadership, I wanted to seek outside support.    I turned to Rebecca for a number of reasons.  Firstly, she spoke passionately about how a more coaching based approach could help give our staff some useful tools and a framework for developing their leadership skills. Secondly, having worked in marketing herself at L'Oreal at a senior level, I knew she'd be familiar with the world in which we operate - instilling confidence in our staff that she wasn't your average 'trainer'.  And lastly because I knew that with her excellent academic background and strong personality, she'd be a good cultural fit for the company.    Rebecca worked very collaboratively with me to develop a tailor made 6 month coaching based leadership programme. She put so much time and thought into this and after each session, we tweaked it according to what worked / didn't work with each group.    The entire management team of sixty people have now been through the course (from senior consultants up to the Board) and have scored it well above 90% for impact. It is having a huge impact of people's confidence with leading teams, managing clients and coaching staff as part of day to day line management.    I've co led the session with Rebecca and have learned so much from this myself. She puts a huge amount of energy and intellect into her work and it's hard for people therefore not to respond very positively.    I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending her to other organisations and would be happy to give further verbal endorsement if required. I can't speak highly enough of her.""

Are you currently an ICF member? - Yes/No : <br /><b>I am a member of the Association for Coaching (AC) because it is big in the UK and shares a near-identical code of ethics to the ICF.  I was a member of the ICF from 2003-2009 but switched to the AC as I found that the member benefits from the AC were considerably better than those of the ICF in the UK.

In addition to English, what languages do you speak? : <br /><b>French & Italian - both studied to degree level.    I lived in Paris for a year and then worked 7 years for a French company (L'Oreal) where I regularly used my French for business, travelled to Paris for meetings in French typically every quarter, and was surrounded by French documents.  My French is therefore very good, and although for the past few years I've not been speaking it, it tends to flood back!  I also lived in Rome for a year, and for the past 1.5 years have had an Italian nanny who I speak Italian with on a daily basis.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b>English (French in the past)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>Overall I was pleased with this session - I completely danced in the moment to what was needed and ended up doing a bit of Process, a bit of Fulfilment and a bit of Balance, creating a safe space where I listened actively, asked (in the main) good powerful questions, and very much held her as NCRW and championed her throughout.    I waffled right at the start (had a Level 1 moment of being conscious this was being recorded for my application! - which I pretty quickly got over) and could have asked the 'what do you want to get from this session' question more succinctly. Good intruding - cut off the story, kept her focused.    Got her into her feelings when she was starting to ""talk about"" it - getting her to experience the feelings of ""tightness"" and prodding her to explore that.  Good curiosity - what's it like to 'not know'?  I could have used geography better here and got her to move around/curl up/create tightness, but didn't (also as we were using skype with headsets and she's 8mths pregnant, to be fair!) - I think she got there pretty well without though.    Process coaching on feeling of aloneness and out of control - reassuring her about why we're talking about this, holding her in it while she sits with it.  Lots of space holding, gently asking her to say more (she is a 'talker'), and I consciously wanted to give her room for this.     Acknowledgement, championing - she's so brave, flouting the 'rules'.  I offered a context/perspective, following my intuition and what I know of her, that the reason why she's feeling this out of control is because she's bravely choosing to go into this birth in a different way to the usual (she lives in the US and wants a natural home birth and has signed herself off insurance cover).    When she asked 'what do you advise?', I didn't get sucked in to that, but instead asked her what the gift of the fear is to her.  I really wanted for her to not be afraid of the fact she has fear around this, but to embrace what is positive about that fear.  I gave her space to list things and then I added another thing that I see for her as being a gift of this fear (the fact that she'll be able to look back on the experience and be so proud) which my intuition knew would resonate for her - and it did.    I had created a safe enough space for her to say that she fears that she might be setting herself up for a fall (which she said she hasn't spoken about to anyone else).  A bit of Fulfilment coaching came in here when I identified the saboteur (the 'Background Cloud') and used her language to build on the metaphor.  At this point I started saying stuff myself about the weather coming and going, etc - I would have been better not to do that! Listening back, I could have used the weather to supply fresh perspectives, and moved into some Balance coaching, getting her to choose different kinds of weather to explore.  However, she did seem to really latch on to the idea of the Cloud.      I offered the 'African sun' as another perspective for her, and really championed her on this, which did really resonate for her.  Got her to explore what this image meant to her - that was a better approach to have taken because then she was really getting into the visualisation of it and I just let her talk it out as the metaphor was helping her.  I intruded at one point when she was saying ""Especially because..."" and probably shouldn't have, although the reason for it was that I knew the session time we had (I had arranged a 15 min coaching slot with her) was up and so I was conscious to bring things towards a conclusion.    I picked up on her language of 'clinging on', got her to think about what a more empowering alternative would be - she came up with 'riding the sun'. I then looped it back to what she'd said at the start about being a follower (which I KNOW is too small thinking for her - she is not just a follower at all and I wanted her to be able to get over this limiting belief!) and championed her to think of herself as a complete leader of her experience here.  Called her forth strongly about being a leader, and that 'I'm a follower' is an outdated label for her.  Followed my intuition that the train driver analogy she came up with was not as right for her as the 'riding the sun' imagery.
