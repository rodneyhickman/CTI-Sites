Level 1 response: : <br /><b>From the moment I met my first CTI FOTL, an inner voice gleefully shouted, ""That's for me""! That urge never left. Now I'm trained and ready (including room in my life) to leap. I'm thrilled to build upon my 15+ years as a spirited co-leader of experiential workshops. I delight in coaching, in CTI's values and in the fact that there is no ""heart-ectomy"" in the Co-Active Way. A lover of ""dancing in this moment"" with a roomful of beautiful people, I believe I will be a natural, powerful FOTL. I embrace this opportunity to lead, serve, and grow fresh coaches. I believe  Co-Active coaching is nothing short of transformational, and I'm honored to represent it. Henry Kimsey-House once advised me by saying, ""Eat the Plum!"" Being a FORL is my plum. And it's juicy!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>As a joy enthusiast, Big Love Warrior and servant leader, I say ""Yes!"" to this call to passionate, front of the room leadership that will fuel the next wave of Co-Active, global transformation. Yes to deepening in the Co-Active Way, to nourishing new coaches rising, and to igniting organizations. Yes to my impact in service of the world that is longing to be born. Dawna Markova said it beautifully: ""I choose to risk my significance, so that that which came to me as seed goes on as blossom, and that which came to me as blossom goes on as fruit."" Breathing deeply, feet firmly on the ground, eyes shining, I say yes to this call to lead...and apply with joy.""</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2007. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Talented, creative mid-career professionals who are hungry for more on-purpose, turbo-charged living.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.

With the addition of Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) clients), 40%.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>My private coaching clients' relationships often surface (of course!). I've led teams as nonprofit Board Chair, thus coached informally in service of organizational mission/goals.  I hold an MA in Counseling and previously counseled individuals and couples.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>The Center for Creative Leadership, New Coach Orientation Program (2013), The Institute for Life Coach Training, Basic Program (2001). I'm also a member of ICF CO and participate in professional development.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I've led ""Our Whole Lives ~ Sexuality and Spirituality"" Training of Facilitators weekend experiential workshops approximately 4x/year nationally (since 1999 when I applied for and was invited to join cadre of trainers). Led Training of Trainers in US and Canada. In 2001-2003, consultant trainer with The Corporation for National Service leading trainings (primarily Washington DC) for Americorps*VISTA volunteers. As a co-author of comprehensive groundbreaking curriculum, designed and facilitating trainings for professionals in response to national demand, 1985-1989. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes, onboarding with the Center for Creative Leadership (in Colorado Springs where I reside) as contractor/Adjunct Staff. My roles are 1) to facilitate the Organizational Workshop debrief, 2) be a Feedback Coach with executives during the Leadership Development Program, and 3) provide three follow-up coaching sessions with coachees once back in their organization. Like CTI, CCL provides contract coaches advance dates to select from, and I will schedule based upon my availability. I anticipate approximately 4 days onsite/month with no travel time needed.    Stepping down from ""Our Whole Lives"" national training cadre (after 15 years) to be CTI Front of Room Leader...so no conflict there.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>1) My current role as Adjunct Staff/coach with the Center for Creative Leadership in their Leadership Development Program. 2) Nonprofit board leadership, including Board Chair. 3) I've managed staff. 4) But most importantly, I live a life of Co-Active servant leadership. Wholehearted engagement in all things. For instance---in 2007 I  jumped into serving a presidential campaign, becoming our National Delegate, interviewed by national and international media, and worked side by side with local, state and national elected officials and leaders in making a difference. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Bottom line: I'm bold, creative, curious, fearless (especially when in service of a cause bigger than mySelf), inspirational with both gravitas and ""presence"",  and am passionate about the huge difference that the Co-Active frame can make for corporations/organizations, frankly ALL human systems in the world! I have a keen intellect, see and love the big picture, lean into potential...and am willing to learn.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>15 minute segment with ""M"": 2:00-17:00 (4th coaching session)  When ""M"" named two possible topics for today, career or ""feeling underwater,"" I got curious and reflected both her body language and metaphor: ""I notice you said with your hands overhead that you're 'underwater' two times...Everything, all of you is welcome here."" This created space for the agenda to come from her, in service of her bigger, whole life. The PQ that followed, ""If we had a super-charged session, what would be true an hour from now?"" helped ""M"" connect with her desired future state. As we explored ""underwater,"" I embraced the Process principle, inviting her to experience ""the squeeze"" between the silent judgment of her ex and the ""verbal vomit"" of her boyfriend all while ""underwater"". I echo her, and ask: ""Money...tight...strangle...show me you you feel NOW?"" I sensed a watershed moment when ""M"" stated, ""With Lance it's exhausting...I can do no right."" Listening to my intuition, a bold question formed. I did a L1/L3 gut check. Then, I articulated what was going on in me and asked the PQ: ""I almost blurted. I guess I better. My intuition in service of you. Tell me again why Lance is in your life?"" (This would have been even more powerful without 'tell me again' and 'why' but even so, it was evocative.) ""M's"" tears flowed and clear knowing rose. ""Is it enough to stay with someone? (She asked herself.) No it's not. It feels like I'm doing the wrong thing."" I took her where she was, deepening into Process, welcoming her tears: ""So, those tears are water flowing. Painful. True. No rules. Allow yourself to Be THERE. What is true.?"" This was the divine Process floodgate. ** END OF DEMO SEGMENT** ""M"" thanked CTI for this demo synchronicity in her life. By the end, two gorgeous inquiries emerged in ""M's"" own words: ""How Do I Want to Live? and ""How Big Can It Be??"" BIG PICTURE CRITIQUE:  1) We danced in the moment---real, flowing in the Be With of Process. Relationship vibrant, trusting, risk-taking in deep, strong container. Client benefitted hugely. 2) This session went long. This was my self-management challenge, as""M's"" big break-up decision emerged in real time. Advice to myself: Remember (really) that the client is NCRW! </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
