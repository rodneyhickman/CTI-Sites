Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Since the day I did my fundamentals course I knew I wanted to be a FORL for CTI. The way the co-leaders are vulnerable, real, dance together and draw learning from what is present in the room is unique and I want to be and do that. It fits in so well with my values of continuous learning, wacky fun, of service, creativity, variety, present moment and challenge. This is so different from every other training course I have ever attended and I took the CTI Leadership Program to learn how to do this myself.   I've incorporated co-leading into my training job and changed how we train leaders. I am now co-leading (with a CTI leader) the leadership development for all middle managers. Even when I am solo, I co-lead with the material so it is completely different from the way I trained before. I know it works because participants tell me it is the best training they have ever attended and many tell me they noticed a huge change in the way I show up in front of the room. I can be me.  Being a FORL for CTI would enable me to do what I love, have fun and get paid for it. I would grow as a leader, hone my coaching skills and learn so much. I would connect with a larger group of people who also love coaching. It would give me more credibility with prospective clients. The best is that I would stay at my current job which is part time and also contract with CTI.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>When I attended the CTI courses I was going through a difficult divorce. The coaching skills I learned there changed my life. I used to come home from a course and teach my children (6 and 9 at the time) and we used these skills together and were able to emerge from that experience whole and healed. This was because of what I had learned and how I had grown from being coached.   People need co-active coaching in their lives. I see it every day, parents struggling with teens, teens trying so hard to live up to expectations and find their way. People are going through transitions, trying to find meaningful careers and live fulfilling lives. In my Indo-Canadian community, we need to be able to see different perspectives, learn about our saboteurs so we don't follow old patterns and find ways to integrate with society in authentic ways that preserve the best of our heritage. These are leader quests I am pursuing because I attended Leadership.  As a FORL, I would be having that kind of profound impact on the people who attend the courses and I would learn from them in the process. I would be able to give back to others, the way I was given when I attended the courses. I would be at the fore front of helping spread co-active coaching and be part of the group of people who do magic in the world.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>5 Coaching clients who sign on for a minimum of 4 months.

When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>I began coaching for my company (in addition to training) when I started CTI coaching courses in 2005. At that time I coached for  my company and so began receicving payment for professional coaching. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Each year I work with different teams and groups at my company to understand their needs and provide training/coaching to meet that need. Here are some examples of what I've done in the past 3 years:- o	Lead an immunity to change workshop for company directors to help them uncover their personal immunity maps and big assumptions. The whole group were working on one group goal. We worked in pairs and shared these assumptions which were very personal and at the same time global. Followed up with group members to keep accountability on actions. o	Facilitated an off-site retreat for Operations managers. They wanted to regroup and recognise where the organization was and set goals for the next year. I used a SandTray (using images to help facilitate dialogue from the heart) and helped them uncover deep truths. I helped keep them on track and not fall into the trap of complaining and staying stuck. Followed up with group leader for accountability on actions. o	Facilitated a one-day retreat for a newer group at my company. Some of them were meeting face to face for the first time. I led exercises to help them learn about each other and build on that for future working together. Facilitated their visioning session and then led a brainstorming session on how they can achieve that vision as a team. I followed up with group leaders to keep accountability on actions.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I attended the Immunity To Change Facilitators workshop given by Bob Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey at Harvard University in Feb 2013.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I am a corporate coach and trainer working for a High-Tech company in the Lower mainland in BC. Each workshop listed below is given once a year and if there are enough participants more than once a year.  I lead workshops for directors, middle managers, technical managers and engineers on the following:  o	Managing in the Middle program: I co-created and co-lead this 4 day experiential program for middle managers with Joni Mar (CTI Leader). We cover Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Coaching Skills, Emotional Intelligence, Change Leadership, Group Dynamics and Managing Stakeholders.  o	Intermediate Coaching Skills Workshop:  I co-created and co-lead this 2 day experiential program for middle managers with Joni Mar (CTI Leader).   o	Supervisory and Leadership Training Program: I created and lead this 7 module leadership series for first time supervisors and team leaders. Subjects covered include cover Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Coaching skills, Situational Leadership, Developing Effective Teams, Giving and Receiving Constructive Feedback, Influencing Skills, Conflict Resolution, Presentation Skills.  o	These other workshops are from half to two days in length given for a general audience at my company.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I started my career as a software engineer and moved into team leading,  project engineering and technical project management before a career transition into training and coaching. I've worked inside organizations my whole career and understand the challenges, way of thinking and communicating, and the skepticism of "soft skills" training that can exist inside an organization. I use this experience to give real life examples, explain concepts and link them to practical tools for change.  With my engineering background I am not afraid of acronyms, team dynamics and handling questions related to "prove it works". I've also learnt how to use all the co-active coaching tools but use different language to describe them so people inside organizations are open to using the tools.  Once they have accepted me and there is trust in the room, it's fun to change people's perspectives and have managers in the room start talking about how to access their gut, what the energy in a room/group is, global listening, be vulnerable and share from the heart. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I have worked for the same company for 19 years and have trained mainly in the Lower Mainland office. My company has subsidiaries all over the world. I have led training in subsidiaries in the UK, Montreal, Ottawa, Gatineau and Halifax and I understand how different each subsidiary's culture and norms can be.  This has helped me to be able to listen to what is needed for that particular group and dance in that moment.  The most exciting thing about this is coming back to the leaders at the head office and starting the dialogue on what the subsidiary needs are and help them improve communications between the groups</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Please forward to 9:10 and listen until 25 minute mark. I've written a critique of these minutes of coaching.    Preamble: The client started by saying his topic was to give constructive feedback to a direct report. He was stuck because there was new feedback, it would be over the phone a first for him and he didn't know if his goal of the employee hearing it and making changes would be achieved. He used the metaphor of a rabbit hole.    9:00 onwards: I used curiosity and had him explore the rabbit hole and he realized about where he didn't want to go during the feedback call. I used L3 listening and articulated what was going on so client became aware of his topic; he wanted her to listen, understand and take action to improve. I asked powerful questions about what could happen if employee didn't listen and he realized that could mean dismissal in the longer term. He was stuck in a perspective of concern, caution and this call being difficult. I helped him connect to his stake for the call and then used the balance formula to explore several different perspectives. I used geography to help him feel the perspectives. I blurted, used my intuition during this and he chose a powerful perspective heart-to-heart from which to brainstorm possibilities. He was able to quickly brainstorm 4 ideas that were about dialogue, connection to her and the message. He forwarded the action by choosing to use them before and during his call. He deepened his learning and realized it could be about an attitude as he made this call. He called it a different dial on a radio. At the end of the coaching I acknowledged his genuine concern for his employee.    I made a request and he agreed to create a heart-to-heart structure to use during his call. I would have liked to have made it about the dial on the radio and have him realize he could be in this heart-to-heart perspective during other interactions at work and use the structure there also.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
