Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love doing that dance with someone sitting next me. I love to look around the room and seeing people crying and laughing. I love that I feel I can be fully myself in CTI's classes and that I don't have to hold back. I love seeing the closeness that develops among people when they go through this together, and the 'settling in' to themselves more deeply that happens for people over time when they keep taking the classes. I love that I can connect to my emotions more deeply in CTI's learning environment, and that it is OK to do that. I love how people who come from corporate environments are knocked off kilter when there are no PowerPoint slides or desks and then they soon say, ""This is the only way to learn!"" </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>My Level 1 response above contains a bunch of things I've noticed in the Level 3 since I've been assisting the whole Denver series. But my Level 3 response is even larger than that.      The world is a better place when people get connected to CTI's coach training because they treat each other more compassionately. Every person who comes through CTI's coach training (even for one class) brings something back to the other people in their life.  They are forever changed - in how they show up, in how they listen, in everything.    The way my Slalom Colleagues (4 are in the Denver series - see F4, below) are interacting with people at work and they exchanges they are having with clients has changed because of CTI coach training. Everyone's eyes have been opened. Conversations are different.  There is an air of possibility.  Each person is experiencing passion and sense of possibility (wanting to start their own coaching business) and a collective sense of possibility (of what's possible for us at Slalom).  There is a huge ripple effect of curiosity.  Other consultants are curious and hungry to learn more.  People are leaning in all over the place.    The love, trust and support that gets created in the CTI learning space is an explosion of stardust that the world needs and I feel I can really help sprinkle that stardust. I think the world is having a Level 3 urge for this kind of transformation and I want to be a part of responding to that urge.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I feel quite prepared to lead co-active coach classes in a corporate setting because this is where all of my leading experience has been!  I got typed as an Eccentric (I AM typing - Henry, Kate & Athena - Boulder, 2011). Since then, I have been leading on type (sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing wildly!) in my roles at Slalom Consulting where I'm on the leadership team and work as an internal and external coach.  My mission is to help people KNOW AND BE WHO THEY ARE when they work, and when I am on type (leading a team or leading a workshop), people let down their normal corporate guard and connect to their true selves, their values and their strengths. I love that and feel honored to be a part of people's journeys. I've spent most of my career in the corporate world, so I know how to navigate it, to connect to the people there, and to form a bridge between co-activity and the results that a group is trying to achieve.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I want you to know that I am carrying a flag for CTI's Coach Training and Co-Active living and will continue to do so whether I make it to the next stage of this process or not.  My life has been impacted so much in the last six months by Co-Active everything, and I want to be a part of expanding that impact.    I had a lot to do with getting the full series of classes to run in Denver, CO this year.  My coach Marlena de Carion and I had a dream to get Fundamentals here.  I influenced my management at Slalom Consulting to pay for seven people to attend, then I reached out to my local network, and we ended up with 23 people in Fundamentals!  It was magic.  The passion was so strong among the attendees that my dream expanded to getting the whole series here. It was touch and go for a while (we didn't know if we'd get the required attendance numbers), but we did it! Synergy is at the end of July, and more than half the attendees are moving through to certification.  I've been blessed to assist all the classes because they're taking place in my office building and I'm handling the local logistics. So much transformation is taking place in the Level 3 in the world around me. I don't want to be repetitive with the response to the Level 3 question, just know that there is a huge amount of overlap I'm noticing!     I have seen four of my colleagues fall in love with co-active coaching - they are all in the Denver series.  I now have co-travellers with me on the journey to create a coaching practice at Slalom.  We are creating a new way of being and working in our office, and the curiosity is growing. Other Slalom offices are now considering sending people to CTI training, and people are wanting to co-lead meetings and workshops internally and at their clients.    A big blessing of having the series in Denver is that my husband is taking the series too, and is starting certification in August. This work has already has a huge impact on him and on our marriage - we want to bring co-activity to our lives and the shared language and experience is helping us do that.      Watching Marlena and Anne-Grete in front of the room made me fall in love all over again with the co-active leader dance - so much so that I signed up for Leadership the next month.  And in all the classes so far, each co-leader, leading on type, breaking, giving, blending - is magic for me to watch, and I want to create more of that.  I remember coaching with Marlena in the building lobby during Fundamentals and saying that I really wanted to do that amazing co-leader dance and create from each other and the space.  I also know that I'm a powerful manifester, so look where we are - a few months later, auditions for FORL are announced, and here I am - applying!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

From the start, I sensed tension in Michelle's voice when she said that her life was feeling unfulfilled, like Groundhog Day, which was a good use of level 2 & 3 listening and intuition.  From here, I moved into Process. I used the skills of taking charge and geography by having her put her hand on her chest so she could truly be with her experience.  That evoked the metaphor of butterflies and led to her awareness of nervousness. The yes/no question I asked at that point was not powerful, but Michelle made it more powerful for herself by naming what she was nervous about.    I articulated what was going on (an intuition I had) - that there was a disconnect between what she was really feeling and the image she wanted to portray.  This landed with her, as did the powerful question "What's scary about being seen?"  I sensed a lot of emotion coming up, and asked her to check in again with her body and feelings and be with her experience. I demonstrated "being with" and "taking her where she is" and acknowledged her vulnerability in this coaching. When she talked about her partner, I sensed disconnection there as well - not fully using metaview, but definitely focusing on her whole life.  Until this point I think there was good "dancing with the client" but also notice that we strayed a bit from the original topic - moved from feeling unfulfilled to being seen and vulnerable.  It might have been useful to name that.    I noticed a saboteur, named that and asked her what she wanted to say to it.  It would have been more powerful to have her REALLY say "BE QUIET" and "I AM A GOOD PERSON."  I used geography to ask her to swish it away after she said those things.  My listening and intuition told me something shifted - transformation being evoked.  By bringing in her values of authenticity and accomplishment, and sticking with Process - asking her to check in with what's here now - she evoked the metaphor of juggling. The other avenue I could have pursued here was the inauthentic robot, but the juggling seemed more aligned with the shift that I had heard. There was a definite shift in her energy to a more empowered place.  Dancing with the juggling metaphor, and relating that to the client's whole life ultimately led to the inquiry at the end of the coaching. I tried to bring back the original Groundhog Day reference to her new perspective of empowerment. The inquiry was kind of clunky on my part. Michelle helped make it stronger and we ended the coaching just after the recording finished.    I usually coach with Michelle in person, so I experienced some Level 1 as we were working on the phone. I could have been more curious about the nervous laughter in Michelle's voice; I wondered if that was another saboteur keeping us from getting to the true heart of the matter. Overall, I held Michelle NCR&W, focused on her whole person and danced with her pretty well. There was good Level 2 & 3 listening and Intuition, as well as self-management, since I know her work situation quite well but did not want to 'advise.' </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
