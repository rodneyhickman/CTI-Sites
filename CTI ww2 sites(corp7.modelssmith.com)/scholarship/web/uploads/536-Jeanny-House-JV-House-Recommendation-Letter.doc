\pard\s2\nowidctlpar\nooverflow{\b\f1\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\s2\nowidctlpar\nooverflow{\b\f1\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 I am writing this 
letter of reflection on leadership on behalf of Jeanny House. I served under her
 leadership when she was an Association Minister for northern Wisconsin within the
 United Church of Christ. I have served as pastor on Madeline Island for the past
 17 years, and serve in a variety of leadership contexts on the Island outside of
 my ministry, and with community boards. My perspective on leadership is based on
 an understanding of guiding, supporting and nurturing those in need or those seeking
 change. \par}

\pard\s2\nowidctlpar\nooverflow{\b\f1\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 My knowledge of Jeanny
 House is based on experiencing her leadership in three areas: as a colleague when
 I chaired the Division of Church and Ministry; as a participant at District clergy
 meetings and educational events; and during worship on Madeline Island where she
 represented the Wisconsin Conference to my congregation. Jeanny modelled a style
 of leadership that was collaborative. She represented her perspective to the Division
, but listened to other perspectives in discernment of several difficult situations
. That is a true test of leadership and its impact in the world: to remain calm 
and compassionate while upholding principles with integrity. We met frequently to
 guide the work of this Division which clearly shaped the future of ministry in 
northern Wisconsin by working with called pastors and those seeking calls. \par}

\pard\s2\nowidctlpar\nooverflow{\b\f1\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Another gift of leadership
 is to inherit a process, assess its strengths and add elements where needed. She
 exemplified this aspect of leadership while leading monthly district clergy meetings
.\par}

\pard\s2\nowidctlpar\nooverflow{\b\f1\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What was established
 was a schedule, a Scripture study, and an educational discussion. What her leadership
 created was an opportunity to touch base as colleagues on a personal level and 
a shared ritual. Those elements still exist two years after her term as Association
 Minister ended. Those elements exist without another Association Minister leading
 us. Those elements exist because they became part of our corporate identity. Finally
, leadership requires, at times, to represent a larger perspective or entity. With
 joy, strength of character, humor  and an articulate and well-delivered message
, she shared the direction and challenges of the United Church of Christ to a small
 congregation far removed from both state and national offices and created a connection
. I believe Jeanny House models these types of leadership: she guided colleagues
 and seekers who are leaders in their communities both as a pastor and association
 minister; she supported people through strength of challenging questions and dialogue
; and both sought and affirmed leaders-in-the-making. But for me, a great sign of
 leadership and its impact on the world is one of modeling. In the past two years
, Jeanny has modeled taking the time to re-evaluate her own skills, talents and 
short-comings. This experience, done well, can serve as another well of experience
 and discernment from which to draw when guiding others in becoming the leaders 
a world needs at this time. \par}
