Level 1 response: : <br /><b>In my passion and commitment to helping coaches grow powerful and confident, this is a way that I can not only connect with many coaches, but also at a fundamental time in their coaching development.    Also, I've revisited the co-active model to great depths over the years and I know that I have a lot to give.  I also believe that there is a difference between being a great coach and a teacher, and I feel that I'm skilled in both arenas (many coaches that I've worked with have confirmed and supported that.)   For the last 10 years, I've worked with coaches as my major niche.  In that time, my understanding of my coaching and the coaching profession has expanded greatly and I know that I can help many coaches by passing that learning and gift on.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The timing is just too perfect to pass up.  After completing my three year unofficial ""Leadership Project"" of creating the Midwestern Regional Coaching Conference, I knew it was time to step away and shift my focus in another direction.  And this popped up.    Not only that, but I believe there is a continually growing cry in the coaching world, demanding more, craving more, seeking more in our coaching and how we can impact the world.    I hear that call.  I answer it daily.  Whether or not I'm selected as a FORL, I believe that this opportunity has been placed before me to remind me that there's a bigger game that I need to be playing, for the coaches in this world, new to come and already existing, and for the clients that each of them will be connecting to.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe. You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>Not quite sure as my schedule shifts and changes.  However, I could safely say on average of once a month--give or take, depending on the need and my availability.  I will say that the earlier the notice the better the chances in my schedule.  And I know that CTI tends to plan these things pretty well in advance.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <br /><b>As before, on average of once a month.  But if there are times where more is requested, I would be happy to do what I can to make that happen.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <br /><b>Occasionally.  Considering that I need to maintain my own business of clients and classes and calls, I have to try to keep some time consistently available.  But I'm sure that should the occasion arise, I could pretty easily work it out.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <br /><b>You bet.  Just don't tell my wife.  She'll be jealous and want to come along.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>On average I've had about 10 clients.  Give or take.  I also have a class that I teach quarterly that averages 6-8 and open confernece calls that have an average of 20 coaches at any one time.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>This week, to be honest, it's a little on the low side.  I have four calls scheduled, but some of my clients are talking every other week (and this is their week off) or are taking a summer vacation break.  Also I'm heading out of town to present at two East Coast Chapters, and so I've had to schedule around that  as well.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>Monthly, i think I'm pulling in about an average of $3500-$4000-ish</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>It's about 80-90%.  There isn't much else that i do to supplement.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>Just after my Fulfillment course in March of 2003</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>I help good coaches become GREAT coaches.  Powerful, confident and successful.  Second to that I coach for  Nightingale Conant, working with their clients of all sorts to achieve their goals (in all sorts of arenas)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>I'd say none at the moment.  Although I do work with clients on their business and employees, but not in an internal capacity.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I've taken the ORSC training (and assisted twice after that) and also trained and certified in Team Coaching International with Phil Sandahl.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>Having served on the board of the Chicago ICF chapter, I've mixed and worked with many coaches from other schools, predominantly Coach U, iPEC and more recently Accomplishment Coaching.  Also, because my focus is working with ALL coaches, I interact with many coaches from all types of training.  As much as I love and believe in the Co-Active model, I love learning about other methodoligies and approaches.  It helps to round out my coaching.  Also, in my bi-weekly open calls, I meet coaches from all over the world, sharing their own coaching perspectives.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>The Fast Pass to MasterFull Coaching - 13 weeks long.  How to Find your WOW, NOW!

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>I am a coach for Nightingale-Conant on an ""as needed/ per client"" basis.  That's it.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Aside from my ORSC training, I've also had over 20 years experience as an actor (improv, group games, directing, etc.) which has also allowed me to adapt to my surroundings and BE what is needed in the moment.  I know that if I were asked to lead in corporations, I would do a great job, but there are also others who might be better suited for that task.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I hold the record of assisting CTI courses.  (32 in all.  And that's not counting Leadership, which I hope to assist should I be selected for this position)  I have a skill of being able to translate concepts in a way that others can easily understand.  I've done this many times with many coaches (from CTI and other schools) who are struggling to comprehend their training, only to completely ""get it"" after talking with me.  I also believe that it's important for us to have fun when we're learning. It allows us to open up and receive things more deeply.  I am a strong advocate for others showing up fully (which includes recognizing and embracing their personal gifts, strengths, and power) and then discovering all the exciting ways to reveal and share ourselves with the world.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.  In order to maintain our accreditation we must have ICF credentialed trainers for our programs. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Are you currently an ICF member? - Yes/No : <b>Yes</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. What ICF credentials do you currently hold? (ACC, PCC, MCC, or None): <br /><b>PCC (though I'm in line and waiting approval of my exam to receive my MCC)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	If you do not currently have an ICF credential: : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>a.	Which credential are you pursuing? : <br /><b>MCC.  And I won't stop until I've got it.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>b.	Have you applied for the credential? Yes/No : <b>Oh yes, indeedy.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>c.	If "YES", enter application date. : <br /><b>The first time was back in August.  The second was February.

How many more hours do you need to receive your credential? : <br /><b>got more than plenty.  Over 3000 logged hours, and that's not counting all the comp, pro bono, and open coaching conversations that I've offered.  Perhaps about another 1000-1500 hours there.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section H:  Languages : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>For the next several years, we will be offering our programs in English; all of our leaders must be fluent in English.  However, we do want more language diversity in our leader body and seek those who are multilingual.  We are looking for leaders who are fluent in Canadian French, Parisian French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	In addition to English, what languages do you speak? : <br /><b>I speak very basic French.  Not enough to be able to survive in Paris (unless it involved eating) but enough to be able to learn and build upon.  However, I'm willing to learn.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Which of these is your native tongue? : <b>Just English</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>CALL #1:  It took us a little time to clarify what the ""Agenda"" really was for the client and distinguish the conflicting ""agendas"" she was struggling with.  I was cautious of that fine line between ""articulating"" what I think I'm hearing from the client, and swaying the client into another direction.  But even after sharing ""what I think I'm hearing"", I was clear to check in with her to see how it landed.   Also, I recognized that coaching is very new to the client.  She saw this opportunity and was curious to experience it, so there was also a little bit of ""training"" going on to guide her into some perspectives or conversations.    There were a few times when I got a little wordy in my questions.  Sometimes that's a good skill to ease the client into the question or to begin painting the picture for them.  Other times, I recognize, it can postpone the client from really connecting.  (Something that I continually work on to find that balance.)    I love the moment where she mentioned about being in an empty room with an echo, and I was able to hear the Level 3 and bring that into the coaching.  Listening back, I'm tickled at how I misheard ""You got me"" as ""I don't know"" and yet, that question was right on and took her instantly deeper and where she was really wanting to go.  This started off as a Fulfillment call (focusing on her vision and dream) and then it shifted to more of a Balance conversation (exploring the different internal perspectives/voices) that are competing internally.  I love the fun and playfulness that occurred in the session, while still keeping our focus and moving.  the lightness and levity, I think, helped the client to feel more relaxed and safe in the experience. A great example (I think) was the bantering with the accents and ""voicing"" her inner Saboteur voice.  I also misread my clock (I didn't set the timer, like I usually do) and so this ran over a bit.  I apologize for the extra time and you can stop whenever you feel necessary).  The last five minutes of the call, I became a little more concerned with wrapping up the call and so the agenda of coaches shifted slightly to ""I have to wrap this up in order to keep it in 15 minutes.  I caught that and decided to stay with her to give her a clear ""homework"".   This was her first coaching experience, so I wanted to be sure she got as much of the full experience as I could in that time period, including the wrap up portion.  Not only that, but as you can hear at the end, there's another intuitive hit that grabbed me right at the end.  I also admit that I've just been through the process of recording a bunch of longer calls to submit to the ICF for my MCC and they're quite a stickler for the details of ""goal setting and accountability"" at the end. So while that's important to our coaching, I played that more than was probably necessary in that particular moment.  Overall I really enjoyed this coaching experience and am pleased with not only the client's take away, but also how we were able to connect and explore her in our coaching.    CALL #2 (what can I say?  I'm an overachiever.)  I thought for a moment that I spoke out of turn when I brought up ""her pudding"".  I've never used that phrase really, and it suddenly just popped up.  And it turned out to really hit my client and open up her conversation and reveal more of her frustration.  This started  out being a Balance call, looking at the conflicting voices.  My initial impulse was to look at the ""old"" voice.  She was willing to go there, but it quickly turned out that the ""championing, I'm not old"" voice really wanted to speak.  So we went that way instead.  However, once that voice got to speak, we were able to look into her limiting definition and meaning of ""old"" and the fears that are coming into that conversation.  It was then that we started to shift into Process a little (exploring where she's feeling the fear and belief of ""old"").  I also loved being able to follow my intuitive hit and take her to her Tarot world and explore ""Death"" from that arena.  That was where she started to shift, and  became less of a ""victim"" and more of a powerful advocate and champion for her age.  After that, the rest of the coaching had a different energy and we ended it just when we had that shift. (But isn't that always the case).  So I was able to have her continue to explore it on her own.    Again, that ending felt a bit rushed.  I would have been content with completing the call at about 15 minutes, but the ""MCC application"" agenda still crept in which added a few minutes to the call.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
