Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love being in the front of the room.   I love having an impact; being a force in creating a powerful and transformational experience.  I love watching a group of people walk tentatively into a room, unsure of themselves and of each other, and being witness to their process of coming into relationship.  I love seeing them walk away excited, empowered and connected.  I love the challenge of dancing with all that shows up, the good, the bad and the ugly, and creating from everything.  I love (truly, madly deeply love) having a co-leader.  I love working with compelling material in a community of people committed to making a difference in the world.  I love performing; bringing my full range, always authentically, and always in service.  I love seeing the ah-ha's, as confusion becomes clarity, and insecurity and uncertainty become competency.  I love being able to bring my gifts and talents to a room;   --The gift of my intuition and my ability to see above, below and beyond the immediate, to the unspoken truths  --My gift as a weaver and my talent for being able to find the connections and the common ground  --My fascination with people and with the human experience  --My sense of humor  --My compassion  --And my wisdom  I love the way being in the front of the room gets me out of my own head and my own life, and elevates me to a higher place and a greater sense purpose.  And I love being able to do all (or even some) of the above, and get paid. It doesn't get any better than that!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>We are at an amazing point in the history of the universe.  Biologically, humankind has evolved to become the highly complex species we know today. Technologically we have progressed to a point where almost all the knowledge of the ages is available with the click of a button. And now, we are witnessing an evolution in human consciousness, as we shift from a paradigm of survival being about feeding the body, to one where survival is about feeding mind, body and spirit; from a place where the purpose of life is to obtain and maintain food, clothing, and shelter, to a place where life's purpose is about planting the seeds of a brave new world.    And as we navigate this ever-changing landscape, science is providing a groundwork of data that supports what so many of us have known for so long: that we humans are hard-wired for connection, that we are each capable of a rich, expansive emotional, intellectual and spiritual life, and that a life lived on purpose is a life worth living.    It is the potential for bringing my gifts in service of this evolutionary impulse that has drawn me to coaching.     As coaches, we are the architects, the instigators and the implementers of this evolving consciousness. We serve as witness to the incredible, fierce, tender miracle that is the human heart. We hold space. We stand for our clients when they may not be able to stand for themselves, and when they do stand for themselves, we cheer them on as we move the bar just a little bit higher. We are champions of resilience and challengers for change. We know the power of perspective and the beauty of "yes, and".  We know that we are "all this and so much more", that the brightest light casts the deepest shadow, and that if we turn our clients' issues upside-down, we will find their greatest gifts.     On a cultural level it is about changing the lens through which we see both the essence of who are within, and the external world in which we operate; transforming it from one of scarcity to one of sufficiency; and it is about bringing awareness to the reality that we are truly a global community.     On an organizational level it is about facilitating a shift from lone-wolf-leadership to collective leadership, about creating business models that operate from a place of presence and purpose, and about building organizations that recognize the creative power that lies within their "human resources"; organizations that understand that inspiring and supportive working environments generate the triple win: people, planet and prosperity.    And on a personal level, it is about changing lives, one session at a time; connecting people to themselves, to their world, and to their deepest longings and desires; allowing them to see the ways in which they create their own reality, and giving them full permission to experience all the shock and awe, the imperfect glory and the true wonder, of being fully "in" this journey we call life.    As a front of the room leader, I am helping to build a cadre of co-active evolutionists, each of whom will venture forth with greater awareness and new competencies, and touch other lives. It's like being the stone, as it falls into the water, and seeing the ripples as they expand out in every-widening concentric circles of influence.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>As an entrepreneur and CEO, I spent 17 years coaching relationships among my employees (who numbered 50 at our peak times) and working with our management team.   Most of my formal experience working with groups is as a workshop facilitator, with some team coaching on short engagements.   In addition, I have been involved in a number of powerful, team / tribe / community learning experiences throughout my life. I've been paying close attention to the common elements that make those experiences truly transformational, and recently I've taken the combined learning from those experiences, along with my coaching and mentoring expertise and my time as a CEO, and I've created a model for team coaching that I am very excited to be rolling out for a beta-test within the next few months.  One other piece that's pertinent (and which has influenced the creation of my team coaching model) is my experience with highly dysfunctional project teams. As a subcontractor, working on construction projects, I had many an opportunity to witness the painful results when finger-pointing, abdication of responsibility and cutthroat competition are the name of the game. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>In September I will be completing Thomas Hubl's "Birthing a New We" program, which focuses on the competency of Transparent Communication. Although the program is not specifically designed as coach training, Transparent Communication aligns beautifully with the Co-Active Coaching model in that it emphasizes reading energy, the level 3, what's in the space, and the truth of the individual and collective soul.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My 17 year tenure as owner and CEO of a multi-million dollar commercial construction company has given me a profound understanding of what it takes to operate successfully in the corporate arena (from strategic and financial planning, to training and development, to operations, to sales and marketing) along with a genuine appreciation for the challenges inherent in infusing creativity and managing change in an organizational setting.     In addition, I began my coaching / mentoring career during that period, as I served as a mentor to a myriad of other business owners. That experience allowed me to expand my understanding of both the commonalities and the idiosyncrasies of the business world, and it provided an opportunity to develop tools, techniques and the language to introduce concepts around purpose-driven organizations, 21st Century leadership, and social and emotional intelligence (to name a few). It was this experience as an entrepreneurial coach mentor that eventually led to my decision to step out of the business of bricks and mortar, and jump, with both feet, into the business of evoking transformation.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I'm smart, I'm articulate, I can think on my feet, and I understand a business culture. I have the fluency and flexibility to meet my business clients where they are and build the trust that's necessary for them to begin to step into unknown territory.    I've also had my share of experience being the only woman at the table (often the case in the construction industry, particularly early on in my career), and I'm quite comfortable in that setting.     I come from a family of academics and intellectuals, and can hold my own around intelligent people. I also have an artistic side and a spiritual sensibility that I can bring forward (as appropriate), which allows for just a bit of an edge and keeps the electricity on line.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

The focus of the call was to examine the swirling range of feelings that were keeping her unfocused and ungrounded.   Early on (prior to 14:25) we identified that she has been in a place of competing energies.   14:25 - "How do you want to be with all this?" Christina has a chance to step back from the whirlwind and explore trust and the responsibility she has taken on for her sisters' life.  19:00 - "What if the time you spent on yourself fueled you in being with her?" The question evoked a strong reaction of "not enough time", which ultimately led Christina (who is brilliant at staying tuned to her experience moment to moment) to a summation of all the learning to that point.   20:15 - I ask Christina to step outside herself and look at her attachments. She begins to connect to her loneliness and vulnerability.   26:33 - I acknowledge Christina's beauty and grace, which touches her deeply, and connects her to some of her guilt and the way that guilt disconnects her from her self.  28:50 - "Where do you feel that (the guilt) in your body?" We begin to make physical contact and in the process, Christina realizes this may be where her sister was positioned in womb. As she connects to the spot she is able to "plug up the leak...and connect to self".  31:30 - I guide her through a short visualization that has her draw out the challenging energy and place it gently on the seat next to her. This allows her to release the power of her sister and experience both a letting go and a healing.   Towards the end of the session Christina is feeling spacious, and is able to speak to her sister from a loving place. At the end I ask if she will create a ritual based on our visualization to use when she is going to take time to create for herself (an idea that she truly loved).     Feedback:  The session felt open, spacious, and full of tenderness and compassion. I was able to hold Christina as perfectly C, R & W as we tapped into the full range of her experience without sinking into despair (which didn't feel like it would serve in that moment).  Christina had many ah-ha's, and was able to leave the session with a practice that would continue to serve her after the session was complete.    One of my edges is to say what I need to say and then stop, rather than feeling I need to explain it 3 different ways, and I notice that occasionally I talk on top of the client. I'm also playing with delicate balance of dancing in the moment, and taking the client someplace; i.e. simultaneously being with and being directive. Sometimes I think I hit this spot on, and other times I fall a bit to one side or the other.  Note on the interaction at 19:00 - I could have stayed with Christina's perfect articulation for a few more moments in order to lock in the learning more deeply.)  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
