Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Ever since training as a co-active coach in the core curriculum I have seen myself as a front of the room leader with CTI.   Until recently, there has also been a part of me that has held back, knowing that my own creativity and my own purpose needed to be honoured, to flourish and to be embodied.   I am now the owner of and visionary leader for Lauvitel Lodge.  I have a small number of international coaching clients.  I am engaged with others in developing and leading my own programmes, from Reiki Initiation to Authentic Leadership.      It is now my intention to be a front of the room leader for CTI in the Co-Active Coaches Training Programme.  This will play an equally important part in fulfilling my life purpose of presencing spirit. My natural strength is physical embodiment, bringing the wisdom of the body, from tension to intuition, into the conscious realm.  Co-activity is my home ground.  It is the balance of masculine and feminine, the integration of breath and movement, that enables action to emerge from a place that is centred in oneself, grounded in reality and open to possibility.  Leading the co-active coaches training is a place where I will be fully alive whilst evoking presence, connection and transformation with my co-leader and the participants in the room.    Quite simply, I want to become part of the CTI community of leaders that bring co-activity to the world.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>This is how I read the level 3.  It is not so much about training coaches as it is about bringing co-activity to the world.   Not everybody who experiences the co-active coaches training will go on to become coaches.  Their challenge is to integrate co-activity into their way of being, particularly in the corporate environment.  It is about how they show up as a new recruit, how they manage their team, how they lead their organization.  It is about listening to themselves and to others; about seeing things differently, not as fixed and stable but as fluid and changeable; it is about taking responsibility, stepping in from a place of authenticity with both confidence and humility.      Co-activity needs to grow in corporate life and corporate life needs to grow with co-activity.  One of the hardest things to do is to change something that has already been established.  It takes great courage, tenacity and vision.  The skills and practices of co-active coaching facilitate this process.  They are the agent of change, both the process and the outcome.  By bringing the emotional, physical and spiritual aspects as well as mental abilities into the arena, participants are more able to draw on all of who they are in an ever greater diversity of situations.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Critical personal choices throughout my adult life reflect an emphatic rejection of values and limitations that seemed to be an inherent part of institutional and corporate settings.  My early work experience in a Residential Assessment Centre for children showed me many facets of institutional life in a very intense and essential way.  Abandoning my career in academic institutions was inspired by the complete lack of joy and vitality both at the London School of Economics and at Surrey University, along with a desire to be more hands on and real!  Perhaps the hardest thing I ever did was choosing to leave corporate life, a life that seemed abundant, but had drained me of my ability to be myself and to make what I considered a worthwhile contribution.  And it was not even me in the corporate job!  My then husband worked for Price Waterhouse Coopers, Paris and was only really happy and alive when on holidays or climbing mountains; my young children were living values and creating expectations that I did not believe in; and I felt powerless to do anything about it from within the system that I had helped create and continued to sustain.  It felt like the only way forward was to leave.       During this same period, I was a member of a team of coaches involved in the Deutsche Bank Leadership Programme, an intensive residential training for vice-presidents on a fast track to senior management.  This was an amazing programme that I really enjoyed being a part of.  It brought me face to face with a number of paradoxes:  the conflict between leadership training and leadership assessment; the desire for corporate change (a greater sense of responsibility, creativity, risk taking and leadership) within a high achieving organization with no room for mistakes; a real commitment to the company that was sometimes in conflict with a commitment to oneself.  Participants on the training and their bosses both grappled with the dilemmas of creating change, and the choice to stay or leave.    I now run my own business in the Southern Alps of France, a business that was already established with its own set of limitations and expectations.  Transforming this business, both in its physical reality and its mode of operation, has been my personal journey; a journey into the world of business, living in a small community, and working in a foreign culture.  Whilst this situation may seem in direct contrast to large international corporations, they are, in fact, one and the same:      o	Understanding where other people are coming from;   o	Giving up pleasing everyone and fulfilling other people's expectations;   o	Identifying what needs to be changed and finding ways to make that happen;   o	Formulating and communicating a vision that is a true expression of oneself;   o	Knowing how to stay in the process when it feels overwhelming;   o	Taking charge of the situation;   o	Trying to do it all oneself;   o	Building a diverse team that effectively integrates their strengths;   o	Getting the job done;   o	Being a profitable organization.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>People are always surprised when I express my passionate interest in working inside, alongside or with large corporations, no doubt, because I do not appear to fit very well into the corporate model.  My conversion came with the simple realisation that most people are going to be working for large companies.  They cannot all leave!  So the only solution is to change those organisations, facilitating the process by which people can be themselves, bringing all of who they are into their working lives. This is my part in transforming corporate culture.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

The acknowledgment could have been made more explicitly an acknowledgment.    Where is the frustration coming from?    Great question.  It could have been even more powerful if it had been left to stand alone.  (25.10)  The client would have happily talked about the books she was reading.  Bringing her back to the cupboard kept it personal and the feeling of dissociation present.  (26.15)   Again, it would have been worth while acknowledging both her courage and willingness - this would have been more effective in encouraging her to look deeply, even where it was uncomfortable, rather than lightening the journey with playfulness.     In the following process coaching there are a number of missed opportunities.  For example:   how is her childhood experience showing up now?  (23.55)   What is she hoping? (26.05)   'I can feel I could burst into tears with it.'(28.50)  I would that I had remained curious about the tears rather than making the statement for her.   'Shit! Something's happening, she's here!' (32.50)  I could have simply asked - 'What's happening?'    I am picking up a sense that I 'need to know' before I ask about it which is curious to me as I consider living in the unknown as one of my strengths.    At the same time, following the intuition to explore all the senses was fruitful.  By giving the cupboard space and the boxes shape and form it became possible for her to get hold of them and explore what had been kept boxed away.  Furthermore, the core shift coming out of this process coaching was a sense of being more completely in the moment with her senses, in this case, the sense of sound.  It also gave permission to be with her feelings.  Healing her relationship with her father and allowing herself to be celebrated and appreciated came in the subsequent coaching session.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
