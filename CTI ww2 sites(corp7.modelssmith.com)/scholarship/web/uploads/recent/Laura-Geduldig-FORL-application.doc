Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My strongest level 1 response is simple... I want to be a CTI Front of the Room Leader because I love CTI. The depth of learning and growth that the CTI courses, Co-Active model and CTI leaders have given me in my life has been profound. I walked into my first CTI course in 2001 unsure of what I would find, and I walked out two and a half days later with a new direction to my life and career. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to have a private practice as a coach AND I looked at those amazing leaders at the front of the room and thought to myself... ""I want to do that!.... I bet I'd be good at that... and that looks like FUN!""    I want to be a CTI Front of the Room Leader for so many level 1 reasons.     1) Reaching a peak experience: In my life I have always loved being a leader for things I've believed in. Training bright-eyed (and sometimes skeptical) students in the art and science of Co-Active coaching would be a peak experience for me in my career as a coach. I have led many groups and workshops over the years and I always love the richness and depth of the experience.     2) Continuing my passion for working with emerging coaches: Within the past 6 months I have solidified my niche in the area of working with new coaches, in particular those going through CTI certification. I love working with this group and feel I have so much to offer them as a mentor and coach. As an added value for my clients I have created a monthly Tele-Class for new coaches entitled ""The Coaches Think Tank"". I always step off of those calls feeling lit up by the experience of mentoring other coaches in their work. I can only imagine that leading for CTI, the "mothership" of all coaches training, would bring that much more fuel to this already ignited fire.    3) New training, learning and growth: I'm ripe and ready to go through more CTI leadership and coaching training. I feel excited about Leader Days and any other trainings and supervisions needed to be a FORL. I welcome the opportunity to expand my knowledge base... even if it will be challenging at times.    4) New coaching colleagues: After being in private practice for 13 years, working from home, and mostly going it alone, having new colleagues to interact with would be a welcomed addition to my overall work as a coach.     5) Building my coaching practice: Being a CTI FORL would bring a new venue for me to be seen and received as a seasoned, well-trained and respected coach. It would give me a much larger playing field to share myself and reach a broader, captivated audience. This new possibility for natural connections with CTI students feels exhilarating. I'd welcome the opportunity to build my practice in this organic way.     6) It would be fun to be a CTI Rock Star!:  My husband calls me ""showboat""... maybe that says it all.  I'm a dance teacher, a singer-song writer and a person who likes to perform. From my seat as a CTI student, the Front of the Room Leaders always looked like rock stars to me! And that has always intrigued and enticed me to want to step into that role. I understand that part of the gig is to bring entertainment value to the participants and that would be a fun addition to my life and work as a coach.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>From a level 3 perspective, I want to be a CTI Front of the Room Leader for the sake of creating a sea change for the people on our planet. We are at a crucial stage in our evolution where Co-Active learning and communication can bring limitless transformation to so many more people.  That can only happen, however, by expanding CTI's reach into new arenas such as large companies, organizations and new markets around the globe.  We need new leaders to create this level of expansion. I have been preparing for 13 years as a Co-Active Coach and leader in order to be ready for this call to action. At this advanced stage of my coaching career, I'm ready to deliver the promise of Co-Active Coaching to as many participants as we can reach.    It would be a true honor to be a ""mid-wife"" for CTI's programs in order to bring the Co-Active model farther out into the world then it's ever been before. I would delight at the chance to share my experience, knowledge, and insights as a seasoned coach and leader with students who are curious about Co-Active Coaching. CTI's courses have given me so much in my life and now I feel compelled to step to the front of the room of our Co-Active community to share the gifts of this learning with as many people as possible.  My intimate, private practice feels small in comparison to the impact I could have as a CTI leader. I'm more then ready to make that leap. Together we can, and are, changing the way people communicate, strive for their dreams and collaborate to make the world a better place.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <b>14</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>Right now I am on sabbatical in Indonesia for the summer. During my last week of coaching in June before my break I had sessions with 12 clients. I had already completed with some of my other clients in preparation for our summer break.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$4,800</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <b>1/12</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>2001 when I was going through the initial 5 CTI courses</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>New coaches who are going through CTI certification and launching their new coaching businesses. I also have a niche in the area of health, wellness and positive body awareness.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>My current coaching practice is not corporate focused but I am open to this as a new possibility. I would feel very comfortable working with corporate employees and organizations.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have extensive experience in managing, mentoring, supporting and coaching work teams and groups within the organizations I have worked for including Pathways Hospice, The AIDS Ride and The Fresh Air Fund. I have also led many workshops, trainings and group coaching courses for small and large groups. I have worked with several couples as their coach to strengthen their relationships. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>In preparation for my ICF MCC exam I worked with multiple MCC level mentors who were from schools other than CTI. I made this choice intentionally in order to "cross pollinate" my coach learning outside of the Co-Active context. I also completed the following training programs: -	Creating a Life Worth Living 6 month teacher training course -	Helix Wellness Training Program -	Coach and Grow Rich: Attract Great Clients Marketing Program -	ICF Conference and chapter workshops  -	*Nia Dance white, green and blue belt training week-long intensives. Even though Nia is not coach specific training, it is leadership and front of the room training with many theories and principles that directly apply to my coaching and leadership work. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>Creating a Life Worth Living: For the past 10 years I have led CLWL courses. I have offered this course as an 8-week in-person workshop, a 1-day intensive and a 12-week Tele-Course. This course, based on the book by Carol Lloyd, supports artists, entrepreneurs and creative people to develop a sustainable career and life that honors their artistic longings.      Tele-Calls: In my current practice I lead two popular group coaching Tele-Calls for my clients as an added benefit to our one-on-one work. One course is called ""Creating Change"" for my general clients and the other course is called ""The Coaches Think Tank"" for my clients who are emerging as new coaches.     Nia Dance Class: I also lead weekly Nia Dance classes. Check out www.nianow.com for more information on Nia. I have found Nia training and teaching to be a beautiful compliment to Co-Active Coaching. Teaching Nia has given me TONS of front of the room leading experience! This is truly dancing in the moment. :)  While leading my Nia class I have to be 100% connected to the level 2 and 3 in the room from a place of body awareness. Being a Nia teacher has also taught me to be highly attuned to my intuition and ability to forward the action while deepening the learning for each student in their personal movement practice.     Parent University: I've also led a workshop for the past two years for Parent University, which is a day of new learning for parents. I led interactive sessions on balancing work, life & parenting one year and carving out time to be in nature with your family for the following year.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>Not at this time</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I'm excited to share my extensive 12+ years of experience in the areas of leading workshops, trainings, managing teams and coaching within both corporate and organizational settings. The common thread throughout all of my organizational work is my committed to transformational experiences for others.     As a coach I've been hired to lead workshops, trainings and events within many Bay Area organizations including; presenting at the ICF conference in 2005, JFK University coach training program, CTI's Call to Action Marathon fundraiser for the Time to Change Project in 2004, The American Jewish World Service, The Marin JCC, Parent University at Redwood Day School and Temple Sinai's Leadership Development Program.     As the Volunteer Coordinator for Pathways Hospice, I was responsible for recruiting, training, supporting, managing and coaching our volunteers to sit at the bedside of hospice patients. I infused so many of the skills that I learned from my CTI training into the training program for the volunteers including; active listening, designing the alliance, intuition, self-management, curiosity and holding all people... even at the end of life... as creative, resourceful and whole. The volunteers I worked with felt held and heard through my co-active style of management and as a result I grew the volunteer program from non-existent to overflowing with 20+ volunteers in 2 1/2  years.    During my five years at the California AIDS Ride, I held many roles that gave me countless opportunities to coach, to manage employees and to envision, create and lead large-scale events and workshops in a corporate setting. The company that produced the AIDS Ride, Pallotta Teamworks, was a corporation, not a non-profit. I spent two years as a Rider Representative (which essentially was a coach) where I was responsible for 500 participants per event. My role was to coach these 500 participants, who were just regular people, and make sure they were ready to complete this huge commitment they had made to ride their bikes 600+ miles and raise a minimum of $2,500. I supported, motivated & championed literally thousands of people to help them achieve their goal of completing the AIDS Ride, changing their lives and making a difference in the fight against AIDS.     I moved up the corporate ladder and become the Rider Services Manager and eventually the Associate Director for the San Francisco office. As the Associate Director, I oversaw a staff of 12 employees.  I created, organized and implemented large-scale complex events for 10's, 100's and even 1000's of participants. I oversaw the speaker's bureau that trained volunteers to give fundraising speeches on behalf of riders. And I single-handedly created our ""Rider Expo"" which was a day long event with multiple workshop choices every hour that served 400+ of our participants over the course of that day.     Finally, I'd like to highlight my work with the Fresh Air Fund in New York City. I worked with this organization for five years and become the Program Director. I recruited trained, managed, supported and coached 50+ staff at this summer camp for inner city kids from New York City. I created and led the staff training which was for a very diverse group of counselors that recruited people from inner city New York, international camp organizations and college students throughout the U.S. I was on the team that trained these novice 20-somethings on how to be supportive counselors to this underserved and oftentimes rough group of 200 boys. I was also responsible for creating and scheduling the programs for the entire camp.     With all of this combined experience, I truly believe that I would be a confident, effective and connected leader for CTI's Co-Active Coaching trainings in any corporate or organizational environment. I'm a people person. I feel very comfortable with people, all types of people, and I can sense that people generally feel at ease and connected with me. And if given the opportunity, I would pull in all of my past experiences to provide an exceptional learning environment for our CTI students.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.

There were pieces of Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy that showed up throughout the call. Right off the bat, we designed the alliance and granted the relationship power by setting the stage of 15 minutes of time, committing to confidentiality and setting the client's agenda. Through active listening we were able to lock in the agenda by stating, "You are ready for this for this in your life!" and "how does it feel when I say that to you?".  She immediately jumped on board and it felt like we were off on a journey into forwarding her action and deepening her learning. Even though she went to some stuck areas of her past, together we navigated those potential roadblocks with the powerful question, "In what ways?" and the acknowledgement, "you ARE doing great". I also picked up on the client's language by using the ship metaphor and asked, "as you steer your ship, what will be your compass/guiding light?"  That championed the client's dream/goal/agenda and called forth her magnificence. I held the client as creative, resourceful and whole by asking, "What do you want to make sure to get out of these last two minutes of the call?". When she said she wanted me to "hold her declaration and be an accountability sister" I used my skill of intuition to get us both up on our feet to step into this crucial declaration to have the biggest resonance for the client.     My overall score for this session is an 8+. I feel this was a very good model of Co-Active coaching. The session could have been even better if there were more powerful questions and a bit more intruding/taking charge from me. The client got a lot of talking time, which felt important and honoring, but she might have been better served with some additional questions like "what are you ready for?", "what would transform this area of your life the most?" or "who do you need to be in order to make this change in your financial life?".   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
