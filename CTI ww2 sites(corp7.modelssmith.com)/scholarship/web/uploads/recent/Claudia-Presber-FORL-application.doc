Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Because CTI has absolutely changed my life,  Because I will never cease to be grateful,   Because I love to swim and resource myself in this international pond of like-minded people,  Because I want to keep learning,  Because my passion for this work is endless,  Because I know what a difference it can make!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I am on a ""mission"" to support people in general (and especially those working in organisations) to stop the ""hamster wheel"" of doing, give them a chance to breathe, think, become aware...and help them realize that they have the power to make any change to their work or lifes that they truly want. Ultimately, this is about personal leadership, irrespective of ""hierarchy levels"". I have a specific passion for CTI work in corporations which, to me, is the most powerful approach I have seen to stopping the ""task driving"" and supporting people to grow ""as humans"" who lead from a place of choice and inner power - and inner smile:-)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I am an authorited facilitator using the Team Diagnostrics instrument by TCI and also certified to use The Leadership Circle 360? and Culture Survey; in addition, I am using existing in-house approaches whenever required by my clients - and I have run a number of group workshops and team coachings over the past years</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.

The collaboration will be focussed on corporate coaching assignments in Continental European countries where I speak the language of the coachees.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have worked inside corporations for many years myself. Throughout my career, I have acted as trusted sounding board and coach to numerous internationational teams and executives on all hierarchy levels in fast-changing corporate environments, expansions, mergers and layoffs - and I have been facing many of the same challenges that leaders and managers are confronted with today. It was a true passion for the people in the workplace that led me to move into HR many years ago - and ultimately into wanting to become a coach. I used to love this moment when my peers or managers came to me asking ""Do you have 5 minutes?"" - to obtain my views on what to do, to get challenged on their ideas, or simply coaching on any issues they had. Someone I worked with recently said about me that - to him - I have this ""weird combination"" of a strategic mind, a "damn pragmatic get-go" personality with a big heart which, to him, really made a difference in the corporate world. Working for CTI in corporations would simply mean to me that I would get to do more of this ""shaking up with a heart"", using the best tools and methodology there is.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I started to train to become a coach with CTI in 2009 whilst still in the role of HR Director in my previous company - and I can honestly say that my approach to my work was never the same again. As I came from an organisation which did not ""value"" coaching or training at the time, I had to self-fund all of my trainings. Back in my job, it was not easy to implement the changes I wanted to make, but I felt I had a mission: I started to coach internally myself, built alliances with like-minded people in the company who would fund from their own budget leadership development initiatives (I created one with a CTI faculty member as a ""first"") - and my dream was that, one day, all of our managers would have gone through some CTI coach training as I believed that this could make such a difference. I keep in close contact with my former boss and know that today, all senior HR people go through some form of coach training, that the company has created a Learning & Development function...and I am proud that I was able to start this movement somehow, despite all difficulties. I want this work spread across as many organisations as possible, I want to be a part of that - and this is a major reason why I apply to become a Front-of-the-Room leader!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.
