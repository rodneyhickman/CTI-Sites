She found herself stuck in the past.  There was a saboteur present saying that she has not changed and that in time she will just revert back to her old ways.    What was effective Co-Active Coaching: I started by having the client explore where she was stuck and what was important to her about getting movement.  When I noticed she was really in her head, I invited her to take a deep breath to shift her geography and move her into her body, into the present moment and away from the saboteur's voice.  The L3 shifted into a more peaceful, harmonious place and allowed the client to get in touch with her authentic self. This opened up the space for the beach metaphor, which really allowed things to slow down and help her get present to who she is when she is in her power.  We danced with a few more perspectives including the Appreciator perspective.  We anchored her strength and peacefulness in her core and created a structure around this for her to stay connected to her power and design a vision for her life from here.     What was not effective Co-Active Coaching: The client sometimes spoke in 3rd person when she was referring to herself.  I had an intuition to ask about this but I ignored it.  I could have been more curious about this and explored if there was a connection between this and her avoiding creating a new vision for her life.  I also could have been a bit more specific with the topic.  The topic of being stuck in her 'life' is quite broad and being more specific could have helped to hold the focus in the call as well as design a SMART goal for homework.  Another opportunity would have been while we were in the beach perspective and she was in her personal power, I could have had her create the vision of her new life  (in that moment), instead of giving it as homework.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
