I took her to resonant place few times and she was alive and very much in the experience.   Dancing in the moment with client, mirroring her, being with her.  Used balance in taking her to various perspective and deepened her experience in each perspective. Explored choices and talked about actions to be taken.  I had lots of powerful questions, articulated what was going on. The use of geography by physically moving her had a big impact (when she sat by the window and goes to the GREEN perspective).    What did not work as a co-active coach:    I did not use intuition as I had the urge to. When she was talking about failure I could deepen that moment by using my intuition that there was much more there.  Although I fully read the level 3, I did not name it which could be beneficial for the client in exploring more.  Curiosity could be used more when she talked about ""being at peace"".  I could make use of metaphor as this client is very expressive and it could have helped more in drawing a big picture for her.  I could Champion and acknowledge the client more generously.  The part where she is talking about ""proving everyone wrong"" was a deep ocean to discover and I just touched it on surface. Exploring  more could serve her in different directions such as what is this urge to prove to herself and others?</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
