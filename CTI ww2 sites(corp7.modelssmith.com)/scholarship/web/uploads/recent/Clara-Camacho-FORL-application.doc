I?m also assuming that my client is complete, resourceful  and creative by nature that's why I evoke my client transformation by connecting him with his greatness through answering my questions and embodying his magnificence.  There are also a couple of opinions of mine during the session that are not coaching but my opinion and this, following strictly the model would need to be self-managed.  I gave my opinion for the service of my client.  In minute 20?there is an example of that. I said "Your body is probably the smartest part of you" this is not co-active coaching, its my opinion.    Bellow are some key moments of the session.    o	2?my question "How does it feels where you are now" is a powerful question of co-active coaching since address to my client to be more aware of his process in the present moment.  o	2?54" Deep listening and articulation of what is going on, and use of my intuition to let my client know what I see.    o	3? "What do you want"  This is a powerful question with high impact in my client, he says "wow!" and helps him be concise on his objectives.   o	4?28" Curiosity.  This is a key attitude of the coach and in this point I share with my client my curiosity about what he is saying.  o	4?50" I ask my client to stand up and move to find the position and embodiment of how will be for him having the decision taken.  We call this tool geography and it?s a powerful tool of co-active coaching for clients to embody feelings, experiences and greatness.    o	5? I?m asking to my client to pay attention to their feelings to help him let go of the head and thinking.  This is also very common in co-active coaching where we focus our job to connect our clients with their creativity not their thinking.  o	11?25" Acknowledgment.  I give feedback to my client acknowledging his greatness.  o	12?25"  Deepening the learning.  I ask him "What is the TRUE for you here"  o	17?10" Recognition to my client.  "There is a lot of wisdom on what you say"  And I think a key moment for my client occurs when I challenge him to pay attention to his voice and use it as a reminder of his self-confidence.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
