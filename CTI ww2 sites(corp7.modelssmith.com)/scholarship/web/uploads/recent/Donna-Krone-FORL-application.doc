I AM type: : <br /><b>Beauty (also Charm, Intelligence, Capable, Serene)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I want to be a front of the room leader for many level 1 reasons. Mostly because it just feels right, like the natural next step in my evolution as a coach and facilitator. I have always admired the freedom, authenticity and aliveness of CTI leaders as well as the beautiful co-active dance between leaders. I desire those skills and those experiences for myself. Also I spend a lot of time in my home office with a head set on coaching and as fun and fulfilling as that is, I have had a growing desire to balance that with more in-person experiences. I love the energy of a group and although I have been training coaches through "The Coaches Studio" it is another virtual experience. I have a desire to see and feel live bodies in front of me and to enjoy the level 3 of group transformations. I also love working in partnership so I am excited about working with a wide variety of skilled co-leaders who I can learn from and grow with. When I first started with CTI classes back in  2004 I declared that I wanted to be a CTI leader. I later came to realize that it wouldn't work well for me during my active parenting years. Lo and behold, the opportunity arises exactly as my youngest goes off to college and I contemplate what I want to do next. I love those winks from the universe!    I love CTI and all it stands for and get tickled about the idea of spreading the work to others.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I tried to not apply for this position, to convince myself that I had too many diverse experiences and trainings at this point to be able to go back to pure CTI coaching, but it didn't work. I kept getting this strong pull back to a YES. I believe that I am called to do this work because it is in perfect alignment with my life's purpose.  One aspect of my purpose, the part that happens automatically without me having to think about it, is "to open hearts and set people free". That is exactly what I have witnessed repeatedly as a participant and as an assistant in those CTI conference rooms. It feels natural and right for me to be a part of that process.  I am ready to own my impact in a bigger way and I believe that the opportunity to be a CTI FORL is here now for that reason. I have repeatedly been acknowledged for the courageous space I create that allows learning, growth and transformation to happen. I am feeling the strength of the inner ""YES"" as I write these words. Individuals may think they are coming to CTI to learn to coach and of course they are, AND we know it is also so much more than that. They are also coming to have their hearts opened and to be set free in many different ways.   The owner of Solstice Coaching who is also a CTI coach recently said to me "You are like a wubbie (security blanket) with mad skills". I thought that was a fun description of my coaching.  I am following the inner voice that is leading me back home to CTI in service of freeing hearts, one conference room at a time.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

This culminated in a train the trainer program I created and implemented.

She had been diagnosed with stage 4 rectal cancer 3 months prior and asked for coaching that would help her "stay positive and not give up".   Initially the client was resisting anything but ""positive thoughts and feelings"" I helped her to own and acknowledge all of her thoughts and feelings explaining that this helps release them and gives more access to the higher emotions. I was doing process coaching integrated with some balance and fulfillment. I feel the best part of the coaching was creating safety and spaciousness that allowed her to acknowledge and process her feelings. This led to some future dreaming which connected her to hope.     Where I veered from co-active coaching:    Twice I asked a yes/no question. "Can you get comfortable in the tube". This was a leading question and it would have been better to ask "how are you feeling in the tube?" or what's it like in that tube? I also asked "can you see it?" in reference to the campsite instead of "what do you see"?.   When Barb asked "how do these things pop into our minds, how does that happen?" I responded with my beliefs about soul/inner wisdom instead of getting curious and asking "what are your beliefs about that or what's it like to sit with the mystery of that?"   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
