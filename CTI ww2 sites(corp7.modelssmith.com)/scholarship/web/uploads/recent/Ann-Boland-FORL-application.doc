Level 1 response: : <br /><b>This work was so life- changing for me.  I stretched, grew, fought it, embraced it and fell in love with it and the biggest reason I want to be a Front of Room Leader is I want to share this work with other people because it was so life changing for me.   One of the things that gets me jazzed is seeing people's "light bulb's" go on....even when they may not see their own light bulbs go on yet and being a Front of the Room Leader would give me that opportunity.   I am also very comfortable in the front of the room and have led many trainings.  I want the opportunity to co-lead this work.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Just one person learning and embracing co-activity causes a ripple effect.  The learning seed that is planted in each participant impacts not only them, but their cohort, their family, their community and their world.  I want to be a front of the room leader and help create awareness in others so the ripple can keep going and have a personal impact, as well as a global impact.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.

How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>Zero.  Due to my Yukon adventure, I am scheduling my clients every two weeks.

What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>$1000 - this number is quite low due to me ""completing"" with several clients prior to my Alaskan Adventure, switching to more corporate trainings and signing on new clients for August.  All in all, it's a random odd year and the dollar amount doesn't represent a normal monthly income.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b> In Quarter 1 and 2, it represented 60% and corporate training represented the other 40%.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>In 2007 while receiving my CTI Coach Training</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>My current market niche is small businesses who have a front-line staff, as well as, Direct Sales and Network Marketing companies who are building teams.  I typically coach the business owners and "train the employees" .  In Direct Sales/Network Marketing, I coach and train the leaders who have built strong teams AND I also coach and train their team members</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>25% </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.

What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I have received Body Centered Coaching - trained by Marlena Fields.  I also have a small amount of experience with Tony Robbins training in terms of training on building a business and making the sale.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I have lead a program to two different chapters of the American Payroll Association which focused on communication, decision making, and listening skills and will be leading a new program this August which focuses on becoming a peak performer.  I have delivered 2 trainings to Waldoch Custom Crafts focusing on giving how to give their customers a thrilling experience through listening and communication and how to interact with co-workers.  I am scheduled to deliver 2 more trainings for this company by the end of Q4.  I have currently delivered 3 trainings to a various It Works Global Leaders focusing on managing emotions, intuition, enrolling new business partners, building strong teams, customer service. communication,  and listening skills.

I developed a workshop for a private group focusing on managing emotions, discovering values, identifying strengths and self-improvement.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>No, I don't believe so.  The only thing that might resemble this is my business does have a contract to deliver two more trainings to an organization in the areas of Time Management and Team Building.  It was a contract I proposed and was accepted by this company.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Prior to my coaching career, I was a corporate trainer for an organization in their customer service department.  As time progressed in this organization, my role expanded and I was to develop and deliver effective training to people in several different departments.  I drew from my co-active coaching classes and experiences to deliver interactive (and FUN) training to several departments who were experiencing layoffs.  I am comfortable delivering training and making it experiential while still making sure to meet the department's objectives.  I currently develop and deliver training to organizations and associations and can draw from that as well.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I think that my experience in the corporate world and knowing how to use their language AND marrying that with new content in a way where they will understand, would make me a good candidate.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Some of the thing I thought I used well were powerful questions, blurting, reframing, identifying values, acknowledging her, using the principle of Balance, holding the space (actually creating a safe space) and lots of intuition.  Now I'll describe what worked well and what didn't and what was and was not an effective demonstration of co-active coaching.      I thought my use of powerful questions was effective and I noticed a variety of them.  I asked a few Yes/No questions to her but I honestly thought they served.  It was usually in the areas of "do you understand" or "are you following me".  Some feedback for me might be rephrasing it to a question such as "what are you getting from this so far"? or "How would you put this concept in your own words"? or "what's another way of saying this"?  Those types of questions would have been more effective.    At times, some places where I thought my coaching was in-effective was when I was hurried.  I noticed, in my hurried way, I flubbed up the phrase and instead of saying me reiterating "not walking on egg shells" I said, "Walking on egg shells".  Some feedback for me would be to slow down and be aware of time; however, don't let time control the call.  Shortly after that, when I asked her to name a rule she puts on herself, I let go of being held hostage by time and I gave her the space to answer.    On several occasions, I used intuition because something either seemed off, or there was something not being said.  It seemed effective because it usually brought her into something deeper.    Acknowledged her in what I love about her and her value of responsibility.  On occasion, I reframed some of her comments and I don't know if it was intuition or not but it made her think a bit more about it.  During the time when we talked about "perspective" - feedback for me would be "I" got very wordy, so much so, that my comment was misinterpreted as a question.  I saw that as ineffective.    When we transitioned into balance work, holy cow, was that abrupt sounding on my part.  When I re-listened, I laughed because I honestly don't remember that abrupt of a transition.  She responded and transitioned right into this; however, I believe I sounded a bit harsh.  When we stepped in to a new perspective, I would normally say "what's the cost" or "what's the benefit" but I wanted to mirror some language that I know she uses.      All in all, I think I made use of co-active skills and I was able to identify some areas where I could have done better.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
