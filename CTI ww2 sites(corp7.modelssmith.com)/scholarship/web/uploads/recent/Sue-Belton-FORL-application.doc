Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Becoming a CTI Front of Room Leader is massively in line with my Life Purpose : 'to show people there is a different way to live, that they do have a choice'.  I think that's what Co-Activity is all about - that's certainly been my 'co-active journey,' and I would love to be involved in others'.     I love working with and coaching people who have absolutely no knowledge of what is possible for them, are perhaps quite cynical, and who have probably been brought up / domesticated to be something which they are actually not. I love being a part of others' realisation that they do have a choice - and then witness them as they go about acting from that place of choice - beautiful, an honour.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I think because of my own personal journey, struggles, and pain, as a Front of Room leader, I would help others see that it is possible to transform their own lives, and create transformation within their organizations.    Because of my own mixture of strength, boldness + vulnerability, and capability to now (through Leadership) be intimate with others, and by walking my talk, I bring a sense of possibility to those who are embarking on their own journeys of self discovery.    Transformation is often a painful process - I'm quite open and blunt about that AND I hold the stake that when we face our fears head on, BE with them, and then start taking action, anything becomes possible.    I truly believe that Co-Activity is instrumental in creating, and supporting people in going through, transformation out there in the world. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

I have also been asked to design and co-deliver a coaching skills  training for the mid-managers of an international advertising agency, as well as designing another for an international PR firm's client.

In terms of Co-Active skills, I take charge, use a lot of geography, and ask a lot of powerful questions - especially ones connecting her to her whole life / Big A Agenda. However, to connect  her to a place of Fulfillment, by taking her to her body  this could be classed as Process (identifying where she is, and being with that), but I do think it was also going into the area of embodiment (therefore possibly not purely co-Active), and I could have used Values / Captain & crew.    There was aliveness, connection, authenticity - however,  I definitely think I could have brought in some fierce courage.  I think I was strong at creating a safe courageous space (to me absolutely essential in Co-Active coaching), at using my listening skills, intuition, and self management (as this subject is also a hot one for me!), AND I think some more acknowledging and championing would have helped, as well as intruding a bit more when she went off on a tangent.    (After the 15 minutes, the session then went into brainstorming, requests, a challenge, actions, creating a structure to reconnect her with this new place, and very specific measurable actions - which I will be holding her accountable to - therefore supporting her to integrate this deepened learning, and forward the action).    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
