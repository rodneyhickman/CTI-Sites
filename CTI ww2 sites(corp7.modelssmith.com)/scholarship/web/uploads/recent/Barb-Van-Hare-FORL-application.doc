I AM type: : <b>Beauty/Charm</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I have a huge desire to co-lead with the world's best Co-Active leaders.  I want to "clock time in the seat", meaning I want to get as much experience as I possibly can in a co-active leadership setting.  I want to be a better Co-Active Leader and Coach and I think being a FORL will be a non-stop learning experience.  Being in a CTI setting just fills me up with a lot of joy and resonance with life and I want more of that!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I feel like I can be a strong partner to CTI in expanding Co-Activity in to the world as a FORL for the coaching curriculum.  I am a highly engaging Co-Active leader with a deep appreciation for the Co-Active Coaching and L4 Leadership models.  I believe doing this work allows me to express my life purpose in the world, which is to be an irresistible invitation to expand joy and creativity in the world.  It feels like the Level 3 is also calling more Co-Active leaders with organizational experience to lead.  We need to take this work deeper into our corporate cultures.  I really feel like I am the right person to step up because of my previous experience as a business consultant and organizational development leader.  I'm currently focused on executive coaching, leadership teams, and leadership development in corporations, so I believe I can be of great service to CTI in this space.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe. You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>Ok traveling every time since there are not usually courses in Denver.  I'd prefer not to travel internationally every time.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <br /><b>I would prefer to lead at about four times a year (once/quarter).  If I'm needed more than four times a year, I would need to balance with my life and other corporate work commitments.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <br /><b>Yes - any/all of my courses could be mid-week</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <br /><b>Yes - I would love that!  And I would be grateful if I wasn't flying internationally every time I lead.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <b>I carry about 10 clients on average.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>For the week of June 24th I had four coaching clients.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>For the first 1/2 of the year I'm averaging about $5,000 a month.  I expect that to go up to 7,000 or 8,000 for the second half.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <b>75%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>February 2009 I began to be paid as a coach running my own business.  I did a lot of work coaching and consulting leaders on organizational development and change since 1995.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Most of my work flows through a business-consulting firm serving corporate clients.  I do executive coaching, team building and leadership work with financial services companies and product/supply chain companies.  We are also pursuing work with an Indian Tribe.  I work with senior C-level leaders, VPs, Directors, and leadership teams.  I also work with new leaders and middle managers.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>90%.  The other 10% is working with small business owners which aren't exactly corporate, and I wouldn't put them in a "life coaching" category either.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Throughout my career I have had a focus on teams.  As an organizational change consultant, the productivity and positivity of the project teams I worked with was part of my responsibilities.  As the Director of Talent Management and Organization Effectiveness, I was an internal coach for leadership teams, and I also led team-building workshops for a wide range of teams.  My current focus on teams integrates my learning from the CTI coaching and leadership curriculum, The Leadership Culture Survey, and Team Coaching International tools.  I have worked with a co-leader on multiple senior leadership teams to design custom team coaching workshops with a strong stake, outcomes, impacts, and experiential/contextual structure.  The results for the teams have been outstanding.  We're able get at what's most needed for that team and create transformation through coaching.    I would say working in this way with teams represents about half of what I do.  The other half is executive coaching in conjunction with the team coaching. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I attended the Team Coaching International (TCI) coaching workshop in February 2012.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My entire career has been focused on working in corporations.

There were some places where I was putting words in his mouth rather than asking him to verbalize using his own words.  The feel of the call was grounded in Fulfillment although I didn't use a specific tool from that principle.  In listening to the recording again, I'm noticing how much I'm taking away my effectiveness with the "ya know", "um", "kinda", and "sorta" verbalizations. There were a few times when the question I wanted to ask was evolving as I was speaking it, which can sometimes cause some confusion.  It's the curse of my extroverted style to sometimes think out loud.  I also need to mention for the record that Mark and I know each other very well and the swearing is just part our designed alliance around communication.  I absolutely make appropriate choices on language depending on my client.    From a Co-Active perspective, what I really liked about the call was the warm, easy connection we had.  I loved being able to powerfully acknowledge him in his strengths and really take a stand for the leader he is becoming. At the beginning, I was transparent in saying - "part of me wants to ask this question, but part of me knows that won't serve".  That gave me time for the right question to emerge. I felt like I was leaning into my curiosity and intuition in asking powerful questions.  At the end of the session, I feel good about deepening his understanding of himself in challenging work relationships, and I feel he was ready to move forward with a new approach.  I felt good about driving to specific action at the end.  All in all, I'm really happy with how this extremely short, yet impactful session went.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
