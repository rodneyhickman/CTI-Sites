Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I LOVE LOVE LOVE Co-Activity and want to spread it into the world in any way I can.  The CTI courses appeal to me in particular because it means spreading Co-Activity to larger groups where Co-Activity is the focus (as opposed to one client at a time or by incorporating Co-Activity in to acting classes.)  I have assisted the CTI courses more than 10 times and been engaged and fascinated by everything about the experience every single time - from absorbing the material myself in a different way to holding space for the learning and transformation of others to watching the differences that the new material brought to that learning and transformation when I was fortunate enough to assist the pilot for the new material and then Synergy a year later.  On every single one of those occasions I have felt the energy of living my purpose.    I have "seen myself" at the front of the CTI room in an intuitive way since I first entered those rooms as a participant.  I have now led a few of my own Find Your Voice workshops in CTI spaces as part of the CTI Community Events program.  It's possible that  "that's my hole" around my intuitive hit of leading at CTI.  It's also possible that being a front of room leader is another hole - another way to express my life purpose in the world.  I know that I am drawn to the experience.   I also know that I can do it.    I want to steep deeper in the model by teaching the model.  When I was a child I had the highest grade in my Calculus and Physics classes and was finding it hard to study for tests, continue my learning or stay challenged.  Then a wise instructor asked me to tutor the person with the lowest score in the class.  Before I knew it, I was hosting study parties at my house, preparing for the tests myself by helping others study.  This brought the material alive for me in a new way in the process of helping others.  I have done this my entire life with the things I have been passionate about (acting, coaching, speaking) I would love to bring the model alive for myself in new and different ways while creating an impact in the world helping others.  (The Level one is now starting to meet the level three so I'll move on)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>My life purpose is: I am the Wild Woman who evokes the full creative expression of humanity within.      The Level 1 meets the Level 3 here ...  Evoking the full creative expression of humanity within involves evoking transformation, and leading the CTI model will involve bringing even more of that into the world.    I am alive with Co-Activity in every area of my life.  I believe that the "space" or The Universe sends me signs about where I am needed in the world.  (Where my Level 1 meets the Level 3).  When I embrace Co-Activity, and aspects of the model like people being Naturally Creative Resourceful and Whole and Dancing in this Moment, things feel alive and filled with ease.  Whenever life feels hard and full of struggle, I notice that I'm off the model.  I am Co-Active when I follow these signs from the Universe and things are full of flow.      A colleague of mine recently said to me "Wow Lauri.  You have really embraced the heart of Co-Activity.  You are really living Co-Activity and living the model."  Two weeks later the announcement of the FOR Leader applications came out.  That feels like the level 3 dropping clues that its time to step into the intuitive hit that I had over 4 years ago.      My colleague was right - I am alive with Co-Activity.  This model is a way of being and doing life as a leader and I believe one of the places that the space/universe is calling me to show up as a Leader in this way is in teaching the model itself...  I am currently infusing theatre courses within two community college systems with as much Co-Activity as I can.  It's challenging to infuse Co-Activity into a system that is not Co-Active at its core.  Nevertheless, in my courses, the students transform.  Over the course of 3-5 months I am able to evoke the transformation of between 18-30 students in each course.  By working at CTI I can evoke the transformation of 18-30 students over the course of 3 days instead of 3-5 months.  That means more transformation in the level 3 and in the world overall.    The arc of my work in the theatre is shifting and has been for some time now.  I believe part of the reason for this is that the Universe would like for me to use my gifts for working live with rooms full of people to evoke the transformation of more people more quickly than I can with the combination of teaching in theatre and working 1:1 with my clients.   As part of this shifting arc, the Universe has been calling me more and more to work with groups more often and emerging leaders more often.  It's as if the Universe wants to make sure that it gets as much of an impact from me and my gift for working with groups as it possibly can.  I see everyone who walks into a CTI course as an emerging leader on the path to changing things for the better because they emerge different.  They leave the CTI courses alive with Co-Activity and go off and to do their part to change the world.  There is a feeling of an exponential impact here of my life purpose rippling through generations of other coaches and their impact out in to the world.  I feel called to travel in order to have an impact in the world.  Half way through leadership this landed for me - prior to climbing up the tree I was a different person who wanted to stay in a very small area and only work with people in that area.  After the R2 ropes courses I knew in my soul that I was put here to go find the people who needed my work and my life purpose and that I would trust the Universe to lead me to the right places at the right times.  This feels like one of those paths.  Because of this I have the travel bug right now.  I'm single with no children and no plans to have any and ready, willing and able to travel (including for CTI) in order to have more of an impact in the world.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe.

Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <b>Yes</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.

How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <b>11</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$5125 - coaching and workshops</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>30% of the entire year earned from January-May</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>April of 2009</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.

What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <b>25%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have conducted team building vocal presence and other workshops inside of multiple organizations.  I have not coached the groups or teams for an extended relationship. (i.e. I have not coached an executive team for 6 months as a team)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I am a certified associate instructor of Fitzmaurice Voicework(R) - a type of voice coaching originally developed for working with actors.  What is considered a "coach" in the theatre world would be considered more of a "consultant" in the CTI because the voice coach is the expert on the vocal techniques.  I have created a blend of Co-Active Coaching and Voicework that is closer to CoachSulting - the client is the expert on themselves, the Leader within that they want to give voice to and the impact they want to have and I am the expert on some vocal tools that may help them achieve that. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>15-20 Vocal Presence Workshops and courses ranging from 1.5 hours to all day to a 3-month series.    4 Acting Courses lasting 3-4 months each leading 2-4 days a week during a 3-4 month period    3 Introduction to Theatre Courses lasting 4-5 months each leading 2-4 days a week during the 4-5 month period.    Somewhere between 10 and 15 times leading a Fitzmaurice Voicework 2 hour class. (teaching someone else's class when she needs a day off)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes.  I am a part time instructor for two community colleges on the SF Peninsula.  I am committed to teach a course at each one of them in the fall (Mondays-Thursdays for around 1.5-2 hours/day) that will end in December - if the courses receive enough registration to take place as planned.  After that I have no further commitments to them in place. They may begin asking about the Winter and Spring Quarters at some point in the Fall.  If chosen as a CTI Leader, I am ready and willing to choose leading for CTI over teaching Theatre Courses and to either turn down the theatre courses or to schedule the theatre courses around leading for CTI - hiring a substitute to teach the theatre courses if/when there is a conflict (so that I can increase my impact in the world).  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b> have led 7-10 Vocal Presence and other workshops and had many Vocal Presence clients in corporate/organizational settings.      I worked in the corporate world as an office manager and executive assistant from 1999-2005 so I have also "lived" in the space.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I am excellent at meeting people and inviting them to stretch from that place of meeting.  (That may be partially due to being an Eccentric I am Type with Intelligence as a sub type.)    Writing is not my preferred medium.   I have my moments, and this is not where I shine.  My medium, the place where I excel, is live, creating sacred space with and for other human beings.  In fact, I teach people who excel in other arenas how to fill and hold the Level 3.  Invite me to the auditions and you will see me in my element.  I am a force for evoking transformation.  If you invite me to the auditions, you will not be sorry.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b>English</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>During the course of the coaching I'm very strong in each of the Cornerstones: NCRW, Addressing the Whole Person, Evoking Transformation and Dancing in this Moment) I'm also skilled at using Geography and bringing each of the perspectives we explore to life for her so that she experiences the differences.  Overall I'm very good at educating her and taking charge, while dancing with her to lead her through her first experience of the Balance formula - including returning to the original perspective to clarify when that creeps back in.  By the end of the session she has made an informed, empowered choice for a new perspective and we begin Co-Active Strategy as the recording ends.  I've included some strong and weak points below.    My question: "Do they have a clarity from up there?" is a weak point in the coaching.  It's a Yes/No Question rather than a powerful question, and I feel the root "problem" in the coaching here is that I needed to take charge more by either stating "I feel a clarity here", or leaning in to her and taking a process moment - "What's here for you right now?".      Strength - Eventually I get clear as a coach on the saboteur/first perspective creeping back in and I respond by taking charge and taking her physically back to the original perspective to experience it more fully until she's ready to let it go again.       Strength: I'm educating the client (at 5 mins or so on the recording) that all perspectives are valid. (not "bad" vs. "good") and setting up that she will consciously choose the one that empowers her.    Weakness followed by Strength (8:30-10 or so).   She's very in her head.  While I love that I asked her to feel instead of thinking, its not quite working and I'm kind of dragging her back in to the Respect perspective when she's not really ready.  The strength part of this comes when I name the Logic perspective because it finally addresses & shines the light on the dragging and the thinking, thinking, thinking cycle that we were stuck in.     Great Intuition (11:45ish)...  Naming that there are two points coming from the Logic Perspective. And its not about changing JOHN, its about changing the way SHE see the world.  You are choosing to SEE through the lens, not making a choice about "what to do".  This is also great educating the client and dancing in the moment.    At 14 minutes I name that it's more about how you be/how you feel.  It's great that I name it, and its also somewhat of a missed opportunity to educate- I attempted to educate her that the being and the doing are both important.  That didn't completely land on her and I let it go.  Because she just experienced different perspectives and made a choice, not landing this may have a cost when she gets away from the session.
