Level 1 response: : <br /><b>When I sat down for the first day of Fundamentals I thought 'coaching is definitely what I want to do'.  When I stood up to leave on the 3rd day of Fundamentals I thought 'what i really want to do is lead for CTI'.  I was enthralled with the magic of co-active leadership-How do they do it? What is happening up there? It's so beautiful, so powerful, so elegant and so effective.  Front of the room leading for CTI to me is the ultimate in self expression-all parts of myself would dance and shine and my purpose (to lead from spirit and inspire others to do the same) would live out loud. Front of the room seems to be, on some level, a form of spiritual midwifery.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The world needs more co-activity.  Training individuals to become co-active coaches is a great way to bring more co-activity into the world-there is a wonderful ripple effect.  Bringing co-activity and a coaching culture into organizations is another powerful way of shifting how people interact, how organizations are run, how business is done. When I imagine co-active cultures sprouting and growing and flourishing in organizations-be they corporate, government, international, non-profit, I see hope--hope for all of us, for our children and for the planet.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

We dive right in after less than 60 seconds of small talk.  The client brings the agenda and yet throughout there is a strong presence of the coach-interrupting, bottom lining, risk taking.  The client refers to a structure developed in a previous call (He is Mr Clean [and clear] with his team).  The client introduces a metaphor at the beginning of the call (the chisel) and I circle back to that toward the end of the recording, have him put down the chisel and take a metaview of his situation.   I give some good acknowledgement and do some championing-I see his strengths and through the coaching take him to HIS next level.  I am transparent in talking about leadership skills.  Throughout the coaching I am demonstrating active listening-mirroring, acknowledging, using his language.  I think we can hear that the client feels seen and heard, is willing to take a good look at his actions and feelings and feels comfortable trying on new ways of being.  He is aware of and engaged in his own growth.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
