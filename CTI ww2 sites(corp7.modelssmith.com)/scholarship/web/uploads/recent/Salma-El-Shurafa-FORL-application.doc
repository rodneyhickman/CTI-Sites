Could have gone deeper/explored in many places with more curiosity to create a greater experience to expand transformation. Also, some questions could have been worded better to be more powerful and groundbreaking to allow the client to dig deeper.     There is a lot of connection, trust and deep listening that empowers the relationship and provides a safe and courageous space. The coach used intuition and focuses on the whole person and dances in this moment by exploring and pointing out his values by checking in if he is aligning them in all areas of his life.     The coach also acknowledged the client and could have been more impactful if they were followed by powerful questions as it would have took the client to new places and learning. It would have given the client a new view and he could have gone even higher by seeing himself more. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
