Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Since the first 10 minutes of my first CTI-fundamentals course - I promise myself that one day I will be a front of the room leader to impact the people like I was impacted by leaders in front of me. Since that time, every time I am in front of a group I imagine that I am a front of the room leader for CTI and this is my process to focus and being connected with the group. I am proud of myself and now it is more than just a visualisation, this is a real opportunity, so I need to do it.  Also, I have to tell you, in 2012, I did the front of the room leader audition in Paris for the Playground Paris (Lourdes Gutierrez and Marco Frediani) and I was selected as front of the room leader with five other fantastic coach leaders and did one co-lead with Marco Frediani, which it was phenomenal. Then after several months they decided to end my contract with them, because I didn't want to stop my relationship with CTI, and because I did not met their development expectation for Quebec courses. So, my front of the room leader career ends with this organisation. So my real level one, is to prove that I do have all quality, energy and soul to be a real CTI Front of the room leader.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

I took the time to establish a climate of trust, and my listening (level 2 and 3) good topic clarification. Ease to articulate what I am hearing or feeling, good intuition was named and was not attached to it (ex.: the reference to the client.) Also, I did help my client to name and explore her values, good powerful questions (gift that you want to give to your colleagues/employees). Good connection with the energy of the client, her paste and her rhythm.  Good challenge at the end aligned with her resonance about challenges, I did a bit of the call forth her magnificence at the end when I challenge her to be in her Big A agenda. I also used some metaphor (strikes), and I was with the client without any judgement.     Constructive side:   Take too much time to clarify topic, not enough intruding when she was talking about others, some time I coached her saboteur, I was too kind with her, I should have challenge her more and earlier in the coaching and deepening her consciousness of the impact of her values and what was hide under that when it is not honored. Sometime my sentences were too long. I did miss opportunity of deepening her big agenda, like the relation between efficiencies and/ or control vs the urgency of having a life, also I should have celebrate her eagerness about life. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
