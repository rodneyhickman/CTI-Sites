What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>This is my second application for CTI FORL having first applied in January 2011. At that time I had recently gained my CPCC and so felt the time was right to make my application, sadly I was not successful .  However, since that time I have grown and gained so much more experience including depth of knowledge in co-activity and I have been tenacious in wanting to learn more about the changes in the CTI model and I have continued to maintain my involvement and connection to CTI as much as possible by supporting CTI conferences, training and forums. I also feel that my corporate experience can be of considerable value to CTI moving forwards, as well as my comprehensive linguistic skills. I have also gained the respect and credibility of my fellow CTI colleagues and will attach three ""letters of support"" with my audio recording which I hope will go some way to strengthening my application. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

At the beginning of this 30min call, the client was stuck in the fear of not making the calls needed to secure important meetings for his business.  His commitment to using a visualisation from an earlier session opened up new perspectives and created renewed energy for him to make those calls which evoked a powerful transformation.    Naming the Saboteur (Dave) and sending him on holiday for a month offered the client the freedom to explore the many possibilities available to him now that his saboteur was out of the way.    A new value of "Vitality" emerged strongly and formed an integral part of taking the business forward together with a renewed awareness of what was no longer serving  the vision and the essence of the organisation.    Pointing to the Big A Agenda allowed the space for a role model to emerge who is closely aligned to the clients own personal values together with the realisation that this IS the clients life-purpose and to step into the pioneering work that he is being "called" to do.     The client's desire to be on a stage presented an opportunity to 'call forth his magnificence' and to offer a challenge for him to present at a TEDx Conference.    Having accepted the challenge I acknowledged his courage and our coaching will continue toward achieving this goal.    What was effective about this coaching was the ease of which the coachee felt empowered, acknowledged and championed at every stage of the process and how the coaching session evoked such powerful transformation for him.     On reflection, I could have explored the client's values more around the role model and the words Vitality and License, allowing for more meaning making for the client on a personal level and how these values could also be reflected within in his business.       </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
