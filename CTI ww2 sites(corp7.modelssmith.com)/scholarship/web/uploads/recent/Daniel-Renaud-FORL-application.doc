Level 1 response: : <br /><b>It has been a dream of mine since day 1 in the Fundamentals. My first contact with co-active coaching was when Lorry Schneider (FORL) invited me in day 1 for a coaching demo as a client. Since then, You can't imagine how many times I have mentioned my desire to lead for CTI. I imagined myself a FORL every times I assisted. It took 7 years (2007-2013) but it will finally happen. I believe so. A couple of years back, I called you to apply on the European FORL but I needed to have an address in Europe. I decided to let go hoping that my opportunity would come. Since 2007, I assisted for CTI in Montreal, Toronto, San Rafael and Paris. I continued to train myself, to gain experiences, to grow my business, etc. in the hope for this moment. I am now ready to be part of a world-class organization that believes in developing a better world. And I want to make a difference.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I am a man of passions. Sometimes, there is just no explanation. It's a question of feeling. CTI creates co-active magic. I want to be part of this. Through authentic connection, deep love and self-awakening, we transform the world in a way that we so need. As a leader, I bring magic through love, compassion, fierceness, presence, energy and vulnerability in service of others.     There is music in me and I want to sing it to the world with CTI and co-activity as a chorus! In 2011 and 2012, I looked in many opportunities to partner with (for example: School of Entrepreneurship of Beauce, RDL, Le Playground Paris, other coaches, etc.) to realize that alignment was not there.  I am now in a place where I let things happen more easily. It's a movement of going for it and letting it come!     Since September 2012, great things are created like being a coach for CTI for the IAMGOLD contract and also as an organizational brokering coach with Unicef with clients from East Africa. I believe leaders inspire! And I believe CTI is an inspirational organization that creates inner transformation to create outer transformation. I want to be part of this since my life purpose is: <<I am the sun reaching and touching people's heart and leading them to their greatness>>. I believe there is a treasure in every human being that needs to be discovered and co-active coaching is a hell of a good way to explore it!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

The coach asks for clarification of what the client truly wants to make sure it is the client's agenda (the small <<A>> agenda).    The client is looking for an answer from the coach but the coach refuses to give him an answer by asking the client what are his options? He offers the client the actual perspective of the <<urge mountain>> and wants to explore the <<easy>> one. The client doesn't get in the perspective of easy...this perspective didn't land! The client stays definitely in the perspective of such a big deal.    Again the coach does a great job at making sure of what the client wants. Great catch by the coach when the client is stating all the things he loves to do that he was able to incorporate in his life and he asks <<Do you really want that?>> The answer is clear: NO.    The coach notices the client 's saboteurs (called <<the Judge>> by the client) that are present in the conversation. Obviously, the coach knows the client and can help him articulate what is going on by describing what he sees. The client is really in the voice of sabotage when he talks about all the <<should>> category that are heavy on his shoulders.  Again the coach brings back the client to his own words: <<you don't want to do this, so what are some options?>> In fact, we can feel the client has already his solution of hiring a service. It is clear to him. The coach could have tried to get a request from him to hire a service.  Instead, he decides to explore the feeling of not having to pay the bills and the possibilities that it offers to him.    What happens then, is being in the experience of <<all is possible for you>>, it reminds the client of <<Jay>> (his future self) and his flute concert: the ultimate Jay moment. The coach asks WHEN did you get that moment? Bad question! The coach in fact wanted to bring the client IN the feeling of the Jay moment instead the client gets in the timing. A great question could have been: What is it like to live from that place of intensity (from Jay's place)? Still the client gets in the feeling when he describes the moment and starts saying <<man>> every sentence like if the voice of <<Jay>> is speaking up!! Then, he realizes his real need around all this. <<I need permission>>. The coach champions the client about his accomplishment, his vulnerability (his edge) and the road they have been through together. The coach asks a great question: <<who should Jay ask permission?>> To help the client realize that again he is in control of his own life and that he doesn't have to ask permission to anyone.    The coach takes charge and makes a great articulation of what is going on based on the client's evolution. He acknowledges him and the process they are both in together. We feel the strong presence of the coach, his energy and aliveness and connection with Jason. The articulation helps the client to realize what is going on for him.     We can clearly hear the client's BIG A agenda: <<I want to live the Jay way!>> The client is now more conscious of creating the life he wants in being more spontaneous and living his values. The coach does again a great job in summarizing the evolution and brings his own passion by saying with conviction: <<Your full life will be an adventure. Yeah! Let's do this!>>. The client is again by the aliveness of the coach creating awareness for himself. The client articulates that he is on the edge of <<living the perfect life>> if only he can wear the Jay hat more and more often. The co-active coaching is landing and bringing deeper learning and actions when Jason summarizes the coaching in saying: <<that's right, you're not asking yourself, what would Jay do?>> Great moment to me!     To lock that in, the coach suggests in his own playful color that the client creates a list of 20 things to get rid of by next week.    The top 8 best things I did:    1-	I am a top <<articulater>> of what is going on. In articulating with my full authenticity, I always co-create something with my client. I trust myself.  2-	I did a great use of the fulfillment principle by referring constantly to the Judge and Jay (saboteur & future self).  What I did great also is that I didn't coach the saboteur. I coach the client.  3-	I identify and clearly coached the Big <<A>> agenda with the client.  4-	I am always a strong user of intuition especially when articulating and creating a metaphor (urge mountain) for the client.  5-	I called forth the magnificence of Jason with aliveness, connection & authenticity. I did that by taking charge of his evolution's consciousness.  6-	I did great in championing and acknowledgement of what Jason is becoming. It did help to slow down the coaching's rhythm and to take time to celebrate who Jason is becoming.  7-	I succeed in forwarding the action through a request on a list in my own playful spirit and in deepening the learning with his self-realization that he doesn't need permission.  8-	You can clearly see my own style in this coaching and also my leadership type (CHARM with earnest & playful): I am very engage, in love with my client, dancing in the magic of the present and evoking transformation for him.    The top 7 list of <<could have been better>>:    1-	I could have done a better job at clarifying the topic in term of the big <<A>> agenda with the client. We got there anyway.  2-	A missed opportunity to explore the Jay way when talking about the flute concert. The client says twice: <<it was intense, man>>.  I would have like to be more curious about this intensity and go experience it.  3-	I know I had a tendency to speak too much and <<to tell the client>> instead of asking how is this resonating with him.   4-	I used a couple of closed questions like: <<Do you feel Jay more and more?>>   5-	I also used a couple of level 1 affirmations like: <<and visiting your coach in Quebec>> at the end.  6-	Time was short but I would have loved to put Jason in the experience of <<living the perfect life all the time>>.  A good inquiry would have been possible around: <<what is it like to live the perfect life now that you taste it?>>  7-	I could have been fiercer around the judge and called bullshit on the Judge. For example, I could create an alliance with Jason to make a noise (like a buzzer) every time I hear the Judge.
