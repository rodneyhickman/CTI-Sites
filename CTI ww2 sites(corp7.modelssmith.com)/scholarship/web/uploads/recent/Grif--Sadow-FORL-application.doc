Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My purpose here is to experience and understand and then help others understand that experience. My intention then is the opportunity to connect more of the co-active experience in a bigger more impactful way, ultimately affecting more people.  I have always been an educator, connecting others' processes with audiences all my adult life. I love and excel at combining coaching with education and have found small ways to do that on my own, one coaching certification students. I am looking to continue and further my journey around co-activity from unconscious incompetence to conscious competence, repeating that process now in an even deeper way, becoming not only more masterful as a coach but as a facilitator.     FORLeading is in my blood ...when I imagine learning how to instruct the art of co-active coaching as well as coach more masterfully I can hardly contain myself! I was fortunate to get a small taste as a Quest Circle Coach and what I learned was how having mirrors and co-leading with masterful-caliber leaders and colleagues really amps up and lasers the learning, and calls me forth in the biggest way. There is an inherent accountability for me to walk-my-talk.  I have been out here, alone doing my own thing and now I want to work in community again. This position not only plays to my value of experiential education but travel, adventure, risk, connection, basically embodying every value I have. My stake in leadership was full-expression and this opportunity will help me add more depth and breadth to my full- expression.    I make up you will hear/read this a lot, "when I was in my first fundamentals class and I saw the two powerful co-leads, I knew I wanted to become a FORL someday for CTI", well that is true for me as well. I still have the emails I sent to my Fundamentals FORLs saying to look out for the day that I would co-lead with them. I have been waiting 7 years, 4 months, 17 days and counting and I know my time is now because I not only have the desire I had that first day of Fundamentals but now I have the skill and confidence to back that dream up.    There is only one CTI and there is only one of me. I know my butt in one of CTI's FORL chairs is a match for the future of co-active coaching and education. I am open, flexible, and present as I can be to whatever CTI has in store for me next, hungrier than I have ever been!      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>When I finished my core classes, a colleague and I decided to create a workshop to introduce audiences to what co-active coaching was and at the end we did a guided visualization to the "Imagine a World" section in the "A Vision for the Future" chapter in the "Co-Active Coaching" book.  We talked then to the dream of EVERYONE committed to a fulfilling life and work, a compelling vision of their work, the axioms of coaching operated everywhere, a world where learning and growth is valued over comfort and looking good; today those level 3 needs are only still imagined and not realized for many.       Without making the world and its people wrong, we are most times too reactive and not responsive enough. People are stuck, in pain, living unfulfilled lives, making choices that are not aligning with who they are and who they want to become, and have no clue how they are in the moment. Most importantly, even the support we do receive usually comes with an attached agenda. Co-activity affords that unattached, managed, safe and courageous place to play and dance and build and maintain skills. The world needs to tap more into their natural, creative, resourceful and whole state of intuition, curiosity...and to create conscious competence in listening to the level 1, 2, 3.  Where else would you even get the opportunity to answer a level 3 response besides a CTI application? How wonderful if we were pointed to look there more often. AND experiential learning is a dying art form out there! People are not embodying learning anymore or experience the power of live community, interactive environments.     And exciting strides are continually being made today. Less individuals are saying "Coaching?, what is that?", academia and science are embracing the importance and power of coaching and why it works, as well as organizations are realizing the importance of internal well-being and preventative health to help achieve goals of human capital engagement and ultimately increased ROI.     CTI's level 3 continues to need healthy, enthusiastic, energetic, adaptable leaders who can connect co-activity with these new audiences and opportunities in this time and place and my intention is to become a part of that team as a FORL, to be that pebble in the water of the world, creating the ripple effect of spreading the concept of co-activity into the reality for everyone, everywhere, now.      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>In March of 2013, I was selected to become a Benovate Health Partner where I would be the personal, professional and organizational coach on their wellness team.

From that, due to their tremendous growth I am now assisting them with RFPs and corporate presentations. I am currently assessing, giving feedback, and becoming certified in their need-determining assessment tools for individuals, organizations, and executives. I am assisting them in bridging the gap between data generated and selling their services and creating ongoing coaching programs. Already I am targeted to spend one day a week on-site coaching in an organization and the plan by the end of the year is not only to continue coaching within their client organizations but to design, train, and mentor a pool of coaches across the country to service their individual and organizational client initiatives.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

(Please listen to tape selection: 20:26 - 35:26)     A present co-active balance was struck between allowing for the client to feel seen and heard and taking charge in a loving and forceful manner. It felt like I was dancing with a client who likes to lead off into blaming and story and I kept her on track by listening to the level two and level three -knowing when to intrude, staying curious, and using my intuition to stay co-active.  Many times intruding, giving hard truths, stopping saboteurs, asking her to bottom-line story, and bringing the conversation back to her responsibility and her topic of becoming a supervisor and having to deal with "would-be subordinates like Kim".  Although a challenging client to keep focused and on topic, the coaching also felt connective (using acknowledgments, calling forth her magnificence, and championing her "you can handle it!"-albeit four times) and fairly effortless, it didn't feel like I was doing all the work or performing.  The client did the work and I was able to educate her on saboteur, requests, accountability, (Metaview, clearing -prior to selection). The space I created for this client maintained both a safety and courageousness and I was able to hold a bigger place for the client than they were able to themselves. We danced in forwarding action and deepening learning. I self-managed my attachments on how she could be a better supervisor, my beliefs that differ from hers on how a supervisor acts, and the "here we go again, how am I going to stop the story this time!"     There are times I could have created more spaciousness and silence to let things land deeper and I may have unintentionally stepped on/negated her responses, and/or times when too much story was revealed. Meeting the client where she was energetically, I potentially fanned the flames a bit with my energy, although I tried to manage that as well.  I brought her back in to deepen a being place at the end of the coaching when she may have wanted to be done.  Even though we educated around intruding, I could have used a stronger tool/design around story, or even shining a light on what's behind the importance of having me hear the story all the time?  Instead of holding her to her topic, I could have asked if the topic was wanting to change. (Times when she spoke of wanting to be a writer) There were some missed opportunities, i.e., uncovering a collapsed distinction, limiting belief, the level 3 of the pounding on the table, and really accessing and playing more in her feeling places in the back of her head and heart. We did play with clearing and changing geography earlier in the session and could have built more upon those tools as well.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
