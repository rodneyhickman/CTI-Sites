Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love CTI and the Co-Active model. I have watched it grow and develop from the beginning, which may have been around our family dinner table before Henry House ever met Karen Kimsey and Laura Whitworth. I passionately believe in the power of Co-Activity to transform the world, and I want to be part of making that happen. I have seen the transformation in my own life and the lives of my family. I have witnessed lives changed in CTI classroom circles in which I have been both student and assistant. I have sat in awe of the skill and dynamic energy of CTI leaders. All the while I was doing that, a strong voice kept saying, "It would be amazing to do this, Jeanny. You would be good at this and you could be part of changing the world in this way."     For twenty-six years, I have served as a minister in the United Church of Christ. While I am grateful for all those experiences that helped shape my life purpose and my journey, I find that my truest heart's desire is to work with people who are consciously seeking transformative change, the desire for which is all too often not present in many churches. However, those are the people I find in CTI classrooms, whether they know it fully yet or not. Those are the people who will be the ones to help change the world. I want to be in on that.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I have been listening for God's call my entire life.  Even before I knew about Levels 1, 2, and 3, I knew that what I talked about as call was something that came from both everywhere and nowhere in particular. It came from inside me and from the events, energy, and actions taking place in the world around me. I learned to pay attention to the "signs and wonders", the little and big things that I saw, felt, or experienced when I was trying to discern the call of God. It led me to seminary to study, and then it led me to parish ministry. It led me to big cities and the wide open high desert of Wyoming.   I believe that I am now being called forth to do this work. It's not just something I want to do. I have been called forth by members and leaders of my Birch tribe, who said "You need to be in the front of the room, Jeanny."  I have been called forth by leaders who have taught coaching courses I assisted who said, "I'd be glad to lead with you tomorrow." The world needs this work. The Level 3 is crying out for it. There are several ways in which applying for this feels like a Level 1 risk for me. And I can't ignore the Level 3 cry in the world around me.   One of the things I appreciate so much about the Co-Active Way is that includes so many different ways of being, seeing, feeling and believing in the world. I love that CTI is filled with rich and diverse thinkers. I would love to be someone who represents my faith tradition as other leaders represent theirs as we hold the space together.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

We did some fulfillment work early in the session, and the real meat of the session came when we began talking about her upcoming move and the work she had to get done between now and moving day. It seemed to present itself well for Balance coaching, and we found a number of great perspectives. When she found a resonant one, the Sojourner Truth perspective, we began to brainstorm her actions and move toward action. I've included the last 15 minutes of the call, which are more the Co-Active Strategy and Action steps, even though the perspective-finding was very fun and juicy.    I think here that I danced pretty well with the client. While I ended up tossing out a fair number of ideas in the brainstorming, I was not attached to any of them. She did well at choosing action steps and then went through the ""yes"" and ""no"" of commitment. I was quite directive here, partly because with this client, we've done a fair amount of perspective finding and not as much making it concrete. It seemed important to her and to her work that we make it as concrete as possible, and that meant taking charge of this part of the session. I felt good about how that went.    I actually felt really good about his whole coaching. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
