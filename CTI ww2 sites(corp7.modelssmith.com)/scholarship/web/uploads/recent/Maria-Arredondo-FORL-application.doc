I am very drawn to transforming corporates into better places to work, where real leadership happens.  I have suffered myself from the environment in Corporates and strongly believe that managers could hugely benefit from co-active coaching skills to support their teams and grow the individuals in the company. I also strongly believe there is a lack of leadership in corporates and a lack of purpose.  I also think I am well suited to deliver this co-active training in corporate/org setting because of my strength and my range as a coach.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.

The topic was "wanting to speak in public but finding it difficult & scary".  What worked from a Co-Active coaching perspective was:  Connecting her to her past ballet dancer experience and asking her to visualize that experience, how she felt when she was on stage then (use of geography). She could then link it with her yoga experience. I picked up on the softness of her voice (L3), which opened up awareness about walls coming down, no need to protect herself. I asked her to name that space ("being myself") and describe it ("warm feeling in my heart/chest"), using geography again.  My intuition told me there was something to explore further around that yoga energy, which turned out to be a "more approachable" person when she is connected to it.  What also worked well was connecting the acting with the public speaking (my intuition). She never thought of connecting the two before, it was a new perspective for her. It took her a few seconds to realize it I think. Then she "saw it", she felt excited about" playing a part she had never played before: being myself!". Then I picked up on her words ("bridging the two") to embody the metaphor and geography, and have her play in that space. The shift happened then: she realized there was no bridge and that the distance was really small so she could just jump there.  Finally, I took charge to close the loop and asked her what's possible from this new perspective ("contacting her library to make arrangements"). I could really hear her energy was new, and she was ready to move on. I could also hear that she was aware of her transformation and how she now had the "missing piece".    What could have worked better:  I could have asked her to be accountable (will you contact her library, by when, how will I know)  I could have also articulated more her emotions, but it was a choice not to go there more.  She was laughing a few times, I could have asked her what was the laugh about.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
