Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I enjoy leading groups of people and workshops.  I would enjoy working with those starting out on their coaching journey and I know that I have a great deal of  coaching skills/experience to offer.  Practically speaking, I feel that FORL would be a nice addition to my portfolio of work which involves primarily one-to-one work and also it is nice not to have to organise all your own participants for your own workshops! I like the idea of focusing on the leading and not on all the other work that goes with offering my own workshops.  And it would be lovely to work with so many interesting co-leaders and participants and dance with them!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I have been called to work with groups of people engaged in transformation for a while now.  For the past several years, I have found myself being asked to work with groups of people more and more.  I no longer feel that I need to push for this work it is happening for me.  I have developed a stronger connection to my centre  ~ and because I am more able to  listen to the wisdom of the space means that I know that I will be asked to do the work I am meant to do.  I know that means working with groups of people to enable them to have a more authentic and powerful impact on those they are working with.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What worked well:    - I got her to establish the topic of the coaching.  She was unsure what to focus on and I facilitated her to make the most resonate choice for her.  I went with my initution to ask her to see the topics and feel where the energy was.  This worked well for the client.    - I resisted my level 1 urge to move the client into action and got her to stay in the land of fullfillment throughout the coaching session.  I took charge when she kept going to the negative place of frustration and didn't allow her to dwell in the negative frustrated place.      - I listened to my initution which was telling me to get this client to take a moment to really be in the place where she could see the flowers and be with this energy.  This was correct as it turned out that this is what the client finds most difficult and I didn't know this before.      - I challenged the client gently to own that she did have everything she needed now that she didn't need to work or get anything else than what she had.    What could have been better    - I did have alot of level 1 stuff going on!  I felt the urge to push her into action.  At one point, there was silence - which actually wasn't a bad thing and quite good that I let it be.  But basically, I was thinking 'oh crap. where do I go now?' etc. etc.  So I wasn't thinking - 'hey this is great, let there be silence' if I'm really honest!    - I think I could have gotton the client more into her body - she is a dancer and she was resisting it I realise which was interesting.  And I notice I never said that to the client which was interesting.     - I think my questions could have been abit shorter and more bottom lined in general</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
