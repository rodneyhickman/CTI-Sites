Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My life changed thanks to CTI and the Co-Active Leadership Training. I bet I would not be the person I am today if I had not been touched by the Co-Active Coaching Model and the Co-Active approach to life.    Through being a FORL I can contribute and breath the gift of life into the participants through the Co-Active Coaching Model. The CTI coaching is deep and brings people to the edge to make choices that changes life forever for the better, like it did and does to me.    I would like to give back the gifts I have gotten to the participants and to the CTI faculty my global world view and experiences.    I am from Europe and lived and worked 8 years in the United States and 8 years in Japan where I also coached and immersed myself into the culture with an open heart and soul. I said ""yes"" to all the ups and downs of living in a foreign world which gave me the privilege to grow in all directions and face my own demons regarding assumptions and stereotyping.      The combination of East and West is such a beautiful and also powerful shape from which I would like to share internationally through being a FORL. Additionally, being a FORL gives me many opportunities to keep growing, expanding, dancing with the unknown and achieving levels of magic I can so far only dream about.    Besides all that, I would like to be part of the Coaching Trainers in the world who train powerful Coaches.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>There is such hunger and yearning in the world to be seen and to be heard. The CTI Model sees/hears into the person and beyond to create magic. The world screams for magic even though it does not use the world ""magic"". It uses a more logic and left brain expressions.    The Co-Active approach is the only way to solve our conflicts and problems together and empowers each other.    If we had more Co-Activity in the world, it would be a more loving and supporting place where amazingly deep and meaningful projects get accomplished.    To make that shift happen internationally and fighting for this shift with my co-leaders, I want to be a FORL.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

At the beginning the energy feels a little bit awkward as we know each other well as friends. To suddenly be in a coaching relationship put us both a little bit on the edge initially. I was able to self-manage this quite quickly and tuned into my intuition and listened to what is happening over there at the client.  He chose the focus ,,how to keep positive in miserable situations" and I chose to go into the Process Principle. I could have also gone to the Sabotage and fulfillment (ideal situation) place and somehow my intuition told me to go into the experience and see what we find together.  What I did well was to consitently articulate what is going on and keep dancing in this moment focusing on his embodiment and being curious about the meaning of the words he was giving me by asking short and powerful questions like ,,and then what is happening", ,,tell me more", ,,what do you notice" etc.  When he said that he feels it in the whole feet, I played back to him whole leg - I immediatly realized that his definition of feet and my definition of leg could be different and also could be the same. I chose to not check it out and keep going and trusting we are alinged on it.  Listening to the recording I realize that he used the word ,,powerless" more than the word ,,sad". In the session I chose the word ,,sad" to go more into it. Maybe the word powerless would have been more juicy to explore. Another example would be the word ,,neutral" - he used it quite often and I could have checked it out more with him together. I am learning to pay more attention to the frequency certain words are used and when noticing them exploring them more. What I also did well was working with the methpors he used like movie or monk.  Towards the end he naturally came up with a concrete take away. What I could have done then is to make him vizualize a concrete situation where he is ,,feeling the wind" in such a miserable situation to lock it even more in. It was not my best coaching but transformation was evoked and I kept him naturally creative, resourcful & whole.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
