Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader because this work is in my heart and soul. Becoming part of the Co-Active community was like coming home to a space that I never knew existed. I am forever changed by my journey through Co-Active Coach and Leadership Training. I came to Fundamentals with a wide-open heart and a fixer mentality and sense of responsibility. I left In the Bones (Synergy) with a wide-open heart and a new way to love and support others and myself. A weight was lifted off my heart when I came to see everyone as naturally creative resourceful and whole. I felt liberated. I know that every single person who comes through the coach training is liberated from something. I want to call them forth to their own letting go and/or claiming.      I am ready to create and hold a space where participants can laugh, cry, resist, surrender, question, wonder. In the process of leading participants to a new way of viewing what is possible, I would get to absorb something new at every moment. As a lover of experiential learning, that would be a fulfilling selfish delight. To see where people go or don't go and why continues to be completely fascinating to me. For example, I never would have imaged that Co-Activity would have led me, a former steadfast atheist, to explore and find my spirituality. Now I know that every one of us is a conduit for universal love and healing and that we are all interconnected. I really get that now, and it informs my entire life. I want the honor of helping and witnessing people sift, shift and transform and the honor of holding all that they are in my heart. Leading on a regular basis also would allow me to plant myself firmly in the Co-Active energy (or more graphically would give me a regular Co-Active injection!) which truly would feed my soul and continue renewing me for my own coaching practice and the other projects I am drawn to create.      On a practical leveI, I am very comfortable in the front of the room. I have been doing this since I was student council president in 7th grade! As my resume outlines, I bring a wide array of experience and energy to my leadership roles. I also bring everything I am and the vulnerability that comes with it. My life experiences have shown me that being open to all that I am allows me to connect with people quickly and deeply.     Here is a peek at who I am. Of course this is not a complete list, because I am this and so much more! I am a person who talks to strangers, a lawyer who can think on her feet, a mother who has journeyed with her brilliant son through dyslexia and panic disorder, a human resources professional who has worked some difficult rooms, an ecstatic dancer, a partner who has experienced ups and downs with her committed husband of 22 years, a hugger who creates connection, a member of the MN Arm Wrestling League for Ladies who dresses as a tick and wrestles for fundraisers, a mother who has learned great lessons about independence from her daughter, a coach who loves her clients, a Reiki energy practitioner who finds great peace in her practice, a mother who has a claimed son who entered her life when he was 16 years old, a pug rescuer who thinks they are too cute for words, a woman born with birth defects who now accepts and integrates chronic pain, an eccentric who keeps her lid up, a flying trapeze student who loves the adrenalin rush, a women who has worked diligently to heal the pain of her childhood and a big smile-er and laugh-er who is easily amused. This is what I will bring as a Front of Room Leader.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Co-Activity is changing individuals, businesses and communities throughout the world. I want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader, because I believe that everything is possible from Co-Activity. As a Leader, I would be planting the seeds of this Co-Active change. It is similar to a crescendo, starting with the teaching and experiencing in coach training and growing larger and fuller as co-active coaches go forth in this world to do their work, to live their purpose and again growing even larger and fuller as their work impacts more people, systems and communities! The possibilities take my breath away!    The Co-active Coaching Leaders are critical to this expansion as they create the initial container in which participants feel full permission to experience their own transformations while learning the Co-Active coaching method. Co-Active coach training allows people to break free from their perceived limitations and to grow in to their full possibility and power with open hearts.     Planting people firmly in the knowing that all people are naturally creative resourceful and whole changes everything. It changes how they interact with themselves, their families, their clients, their communities and the larger world. Participants shedding old stories of pain, sham and judgment clears the energy pathways so intentional living can thrive. Giving participants the tools and knowledge to negotiate the world with Co-Activity at the forefront changes the entire conversation. What if everyone stayed in curiosity about what is coming up and what is happening? Communication would change. What if we all let go of having the correct answer? New solutions would be found. What if we all held people with compassion? Acting from the heart would take precedence. You in me, me in you, rippling out further and further to create interaction and interconnectedness between all living beings.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>average six clients - currently 11 -  I would like to explain my coaching trajectory. I started certification in September 2011 and had an average of 7 paying clients throughout certification. Between certification and the end of 2012, I had an average of 5 paying clients. I started Leadership in January 2012 in a R1 stand-alone and joined the Polar Bear Tribe in summer 2012.   I did not focus on growing my coaching practice at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, because I was immersed in processing my leadership training experiences. I felt confused about what I wanted to focus on in my coaching practice and in the world. I took time to explore all that was coming to me from Leadership, including my spiritually. Between R3 in 2012 and R4 in February 2013, I worked with an energy healer and an Akashic records reader. I began to feel connected to a healing energy I had never experienced before. I also became a certified Reiki energy practitioner between R3 and R4. All of this exploration led me to a clear knowing that I wanted to rebuild my coaching practice, bring Co-Activity to corporate teams and create a workshop series centered on creating healthy and nurturing mother/daughter relationships. I returned my focus to my practice late this spring and with renewed energy attracted 11 paying clients within three weeks. To date, I have 200 coaching hours even though I did not have a full coaching practice. I will continue to increase my yearly hours by recruiting more clients, proactively seeking pro bono clients and participating in a coach-to-coach coaching exchange en route to PCC with my sights on MCC certification.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>very little - 100% of my income but very little in regard to my household income</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>August 2011</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Helping women find more purpose, connection and passion in their lives and parents about parenting more intuitively and intentionally to support the gifts of each and every unique child. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>I have two clients who I am working with on leadership growth but no direct relationship with any corporations at this time.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Vast! I have designed and led many department and work-team workshops when I  worked as the Human Resources Director of Employment at a large international law firm (approximately 700 attorneys and 1200 administrative staff). I developed and led department programs and workshops focused on improving team communication, giving and receiving feedback to improve work performance, reducing team conflict and creating inclusive work groups. I used different approaches, including Appreciative Inquiry, Role Play and 360 degree feedback. I have coached and lead workshops for groups of attorneys, groups of administrative employees, combined attorney and administrative teams and groups of directors and managers. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have vast experience coaching managers, directors and lawyers on leadership issues, including alignment with firm's strategic goals, communication style, awareness of their intended and unintended impact on their teams, giving and receiving feedback, management of their own behavior in high stress situations, leveraging their natural leadership abilities and utilizing employees at their full potential.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Attorneys are a difficult, skeptical group and I want you to know that I can remain composed, confident and open even when surrounded by "suits" with folded arms and blank faces. I have much experience in persevering and believing in my message while allowing the time it takes for participants to start understanding, believing and resonating with my message. I always stayed creative and managed to find my way to reach them. I believe my authenticity and confidence in myself allows me to successfully navigate in the legal and corporate world. Even before my Co-Active injection, I always told it "like it was" and stayed curious about how to connect with people which allowed me to gain the respect and thus participation from even the toughest crowds.     I understand the perceived constraints in many corporate cultures. I also understand and believe in the incredible changes that are possible in the corporate world from operating in the Co-Activity way. I would have loved to have had and deciminated this knowledge during my days at the firm. I could have had a greater impact on creating a kinder, less judgmental, more functional work culture. Being able to use my experience and the Co-Active way of being and leading in a corporate environment that is inviting Co-Active work into their culture would be so exciting and fulfilling. The other exciting part of Co-Activity in the corporate world is that it correlates so directly to a positive financial bottom line - more productive work culture for a relatively low financial investment. As you know, the amount of money that corporations spend on crisis control due to interpersonal mishaps is astounding. How thrilling to get in front of this and teach a new way of interacting! I would love to work with CTI on development and execution of a team Co-Activity curriculum.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

This woman started in a defeated, angry place about her cluttered room, stating "every time I look in my room, I say to myself - fuck, I am a fucking incompetent loser!" and she left the session in a relaxed, hopeful energy. I held my client as naturally creative, resourceful and whole throughout the session and allowed her to set the agenda. She wanted a way to deal with her room. By taking her through the Balance Formula, she was able to stand in different energies and possibilities. She became very resonant with her choice of merging three perspectives, allowing her energy to move to a hopeful, playful, understanding place. I grounded her in the "merge" energy" and had her choose her next step and commit to a specific action with accountability defined. I created a safe and courageous space and felt that we were both very connected. I did a lot of dancing in the moment in order to take her where she was in the moment. I used my intuition in a couple of places - 1. visual of "merge" which didn't hit, and I immediately let go of and 2. BooBoo was about the energy of no judgment that did resonate with her.  I briefly mentioned her saboteur when acknowledging she had let go of "the shit" that was not connected to her room. I did a lot of articulating what was going on and taking charge that was good and bad. I wanted to anchor us but took up too much space in doing so. I acknowledged her but could have really taken a championing stance and moved her into a different knowing about what she was possible of doing/being. Also I did not call forth magnificence. In fact, from the tape I realized I was a bit hesitant to push her too far and I could have served her more in this area.
