I have been working with her since 1 month and in the previous session we worked on her captain (in the recording she mentioned her name 'Golas').    The rhythm of this coaching is slow, it's a process coaching and there is an overall movement forward.  My role during this coaching was to stand on her side so she could feel supported and let her discover what was needed to bring more energy in her life.    At the beginning of the recording, I let my client experience her emotion (old fear) by characterizing it (shape, color, texture, ... etc) and also she could look at it as it was outside her. So she could to start to separate it from herself and start to live without it.  Several times she tried to walk away (""it's going to be difficult"", not listening, changing subject) and I pushed her gently forward, kissing her over the edge and taking charge.  What really helped her to move forward was to propose to her a small step (make a small hole) and to connect with her captain.  I was coaching her at the slow pace because I felt that every step was a inner fight  and then a small victory. It was important to hold a subtle but firm pressure. Allowing silence was important too (give space to the client).  Twice I suggested to connect with her heart, and courage (thus to disconnect with the brain mind), the impact was that she could move forward and face her emotion with clarity.  My client is very visual and I encouraged her to describe what she was seeing and smelling, to make her visions more real. Thus she was able to feel and dive in the experience.  Voicing her thoughts and talking to the little girl, was a way to free herself for the old fear & limiting belief.  At one point my client was moving forward on her own, like if I was not there ...    I could have acknowledged her more, for every small steps she was making, I just acknowledged her courage & beauty at the end of the recording.  Changing of geography would have brought a different energy (more power) to the coaching especially when she was voicing her thoughts and speaking out loud her words to the little girl.    I think I was courageous and caring/loving my client, that allowed me to ask powerful questions for her awakening & growth.  I was a mirror for her.  I enjoyed deeply this session and the beauty of my client. I feel bless to work as a co-active coach!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
