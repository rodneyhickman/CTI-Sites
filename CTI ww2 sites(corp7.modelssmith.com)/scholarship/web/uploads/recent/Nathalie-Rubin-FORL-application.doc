I AM type: : <b>intelligence</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Several years ago when I was executive director of an Israeli NGO assisting refugees and asylum seeker, I made the decision to "move to the positive zone". Though I didn't know the address when I said this, I found it through the co-active approach to coaching and leadership. I believe that the CTI coach training program is not only a top-notch professional coach training program, but also a space for personal transformation for anyone who participates. For me, being a leader in the CTI faculty, is to express my leadership in this world.  I know that I am relatively new to coaching and have still a lot to learn and improve. Being a front of the room leader is also a way for me to become a better coach and to continuously sharpen my co-active approach.   Also, being of FORL with CTI is an opportunity for me to be part of an international faculty and to work internationally in places and languages that I love and want to work in.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I've been told I am a leader and believe my life-time contribution is not only on the individual one-on-one level but also through working groups of people who will share the co-active way further on. I also believe that promoting the co-active approach is a way of bridging between people and culture and eventually improving the world we live in.    I feel fortunately that I a the opportunity to train with CTI in Israel as my initial coach training and thereafter continued to leadership and certification programs. I liked the co-active way so much that I immediately joined the staff of CTI Israel, and was part of the team until the office was closed last year. I would love to see CTI reopen its doors in Israel and want to be part of that endeavour.     My very diverse international experience can bring a world-view which is valuable to many participants. In addition, I have a wide range of organizational experience from local NGO to large inter-governmental organization, through corporate and start-up businesses.     As a coach who is also working with clients through grief, I feel I can provide another perspective on where coaching is relevant. I think my background can enhance the reach and depth of the coach training leadership team.     When I completed the leadership program, the parting words of my program leader, John Vercelli, were "I have a vision that we are leading together". I feel that this positive feedback is also calling me forth to fulfil a bigger leadership role as part of the co-active faculty. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

My estimated 2013 annual income overall is between $15K - 17K (including income from workshops).  I know that this is a period of investing in my new career and establishing my coaching practice in a highly competitive environment, while at the same time I am working in several market niches that pay typically lower fees (see below).

What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Several main market niches & client profiles:  While I am coaching both men and women, I focus more on the women who are at a cross-roads in their life and/or careers. Many of my clients are working for not-profit organizations, in roles that span from executive director to program manager to volunteer. About 20% of my clients are Palestinian women who are Israeli citizens, who often deal with being part of the two underprivileged groups.   Another niche I am currently developing is coaching with people who are suffering from terminal illness and siblings of people suffering from terminal illness or who have lost a brother or sister.
