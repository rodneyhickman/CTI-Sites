Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Jim Rohn, American's foremost business philosopher said  ""You must take personal responsibility . You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself"".    I have seen over the years what coaching has done to my life and the transformation I have witness has been at times painful and amazingly bombastic.  I already coach with Gonan in Dubai Parentology and I feel terribly priviledged to be at service to the people in the room by delivering amazing material which will in turn change their lives. Only yesterday I was saying Parentology is Spiritual Leadership, it is not just what we do. So why do I want to be a CTI FORL ? Selfishly, for learning and growing as I believe it is in teaching/coaching that you anchor the learnings  and understand the material at a deeper level and...for being truly at service to people who are ready to transform their lives and the lives of others in the most powerful way.    Second Round : I am going back, stronger, not weaker.   As I failed the audition three years ago (and that was 2 weeks after my husband left us after 28 years of what I thought was a wonderful marriage and family), I know that the will not allow rejection to beat me down. It only strengthens my resolve. To be successful there is no other way. So I choose to be back ! </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>""It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself ot its master passion""  to quote a wonderful author ; Dame Rebecca West.  I believe we were born with an inner guidance system that tells us when we are on or off purpose by the amount of joy we are experiencing. Coaching groups brings me the greatest joy which makes me believe that I am then in alignment with my purpose. Good is the energy of Great and I believe I am good in what I do and by stretching myself, by being fully present for others, by holding the room, by opening the heart to the point of hearing its whisper in others, by learning to dance better with another,  I will become Great. I trust FORL will the the platform to be at greater service to others, to myself, and to a Higher Power.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
