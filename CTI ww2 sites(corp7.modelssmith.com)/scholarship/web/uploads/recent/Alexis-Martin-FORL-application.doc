Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My journey to becoming a CPCC and my continued work as a Co-Active coach has been an absolutely transformative one.  There is a strong and clear desire within me to evoke that same type of individual and collective transformation. I see myself as a catalyst of the ripple effect truly Co-Active Leaders create in the world. I have played with, wrestled with and explored the Co-Active model from many, many angles and truly feel it in my bones. I understand it as a way of being that consistently calls me forth and brings new awareness of greater possibilities for myself and my world on a daily basis.  I have a heart based longing to lead others to their expression of this wisdom. I can say with utmost certainty that I offer CTI something fresh and different based on my age, life experience and my courageous commitment to new possibilities. I see my natural "come from" being one that will open new doors and reach an entirely different demographic with the power of co-activity. I know that becoming a part of the CTI faculty will continue to deepen and expand the fullness of my Co-Active way of being and that my passion and understanding of Co-Activity will be a valuable asset to CTI as the company continues to evolve and grow. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>There is a longing and a need for co-activity to expand beyond the borders of just those called to be coaches or leaders within organizations and really be absorbed into the collective consciousness as a WAY OF BEING.   Society is longing for more authenticity and the desire is global. In the L3 there is a hunger, and there is a glimmering opportunity to expand on the transformative capacity of the individual and the whole using co-activity.  What I bring to this L3 is that shared vision as well as the passion, energy and time to bring it into reality.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have a plethora of group coaching work, in corporate and non-profit settings as well as private clients and groups I have put together myself. I also am engaged with a competitive highschool improv league and offer coaching and training to the teams. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>I am CTI through and through!  I had taken two 3 day workshops prior to joining CTI specifically about career coaching and job search.  I also received some training to be a health coach as part of my role with a health clinic. Lastly what led me to CTI was a keen interest and study of Positive Psychology, which I find coaching to be the hands on application of that knowledge. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>Strategizing with Character Strengths - I have offered this workshop to 200+ Province of Manitoba employees. It focused on incorporating the doing and the being of co-activity and the character strengths of Positive Psychology.    I have offered numerous workshops and keynotes under various titles for children and youth care workers focusing on how to engage with children who have experience abuse and are in foster care in order to empower them to write a new story and end the cycle of abuse.     I am also currently designing and will be facilitating a long-term group coaching/ leadership development program for teens in care and aging out of foster care teaching them how to write a new story and live independently with strength and confidence.      Transformation from the Inside Out - On creating lasting change, I offered this keynote as part of an international women's day event.    Deciding to Decide - a workshop I have offered and marketed as a stand alone through my coaching practice on creating more clarity and certainty in your life.    Synergy of Self- a stand-alone I offered about bringing all of yourself to all you do and re-engaging the parts of self that have been made wrong.     I have also offered various workshops on meditation and visualization in woman's shelters and other non-profit organizations/resource centres.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>As mentioned above I am working with the social services in Manitoba offering a group coaching/leadership development program for teens in care.  I am both designing and facilitating the work as well as training other individuals to co-lead and partner with me in the work.  I am not contracted in this role and am currently in a position to design the degree of commitment required and the number of groups I take on based on my availability.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have a very broad range of corporate experience spanning from the financial industry and government to hospitality and entertainment.  My career in the financial industry has given me insight into the qualities of more and less effective management teams as well as the impact that has on employees. In this role I was called upon to lead and facilitate information sessions with front line staff and middle management.  I was able to help coach these front line staff to engage in more fulfilling conversations with customers which ultimately drove increased employee and customer satisfaction. These sessions allowed me to further hone my skills as a trainer and facilitator, especially within the context of employees reaching more of their potential.  The greatest learning in my experience with RBC is the understanding of how to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders within an organization.   As a full time coach my primary experience as been with government organizations dealing with burnout and a lack of motivation as well as communication challenges.  I find this work rewarding and enjoy finding unique ways to convey the learning for more people to understand the material deeply.  My experience in working with employees within the public sector brings an appreciation of the 'politics' within an organizational setting and the sensitivities that can exist.      Most recently I have interviewed to conduct change management and training work for a global consulting firm. Throughout this process and being short listing as a potential subcontractor, I have realized that while my years of experience may be short compared to my peers, my capabilities, knowledge and skill to work with organizations runs deep.  I enjoy the corporate culture and engaging with highly ambitious individuals. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>The primary gift I feel I bring to corporate settings is that I am not caught up in the old ways of thinking and doing things and can therefore truly meet teams and individuals where they are at while explore new possibilities with an open mind and heart. The energy and curiosity I bring is always well received and acknowledged as what was needed.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Which do you use when conducting business? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>The primary strengths I demonstrated in this coaching were my ability to ask powerful questions and to articulate what was going on.  We had done some perspective work leading into the segment of the coaching (powerful voice) and I was incorporating values, although I could have been clear and obvious about this - really naming them as values.  I was certainly dancing in the moment with her and holding her and Naturally Creative Resourceful and Whole. I demonstrated a lot of curiosity that fueled the powerful questions and helped deepen the learning.      Where there was room for me to show up more fully as coach was in saboteur awareness.  Although I named the saboteur I did not do it powerfully enough to really create a shift for her to see herself fully and explore the topic with power. There was room for me to use geography to shift her out of the space of saboteur and really empower herself, later in the coaching I bring her Captain in around the topic of worthiness.  Also she offered powerful metaphors, of chipping away at ice and of feeling tethered and limited.  These would have been great opportunities to move into process and deepen her learning around how limiting herself this way is really impacting her.  In this coaching I think it would have been beneficial for me to take charge a bit more, using our empowered relationship to have her bottom line and really get to the meat of what she was saying.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
