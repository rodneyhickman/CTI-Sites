Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I feel I have accomplished a great plenitude phase in my life at the moment, and CTI has been part of it all the way with what I have learned. I've been practicing my coaching in different countries with multilingual clients, through Skype and travelling abroad. tagging alone with other projects also. I love coaching and fulfills me every day more, specially when I see the client's transformations, and how much power we can have when we own ourselves and when we are in contact with our values. I actually have plenty of hours to become a Master Coach with the ICF, and that will be the next step. It's off the heart that I do this application not only because I want to continue to be part of CTI, but also for the admiration I have of the leaders I met in the USA and in Europe.           </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I have been staying longer time in Brazil on the last few years, where I was born, and I had the opportunity of seeing how curious people became about the coaching experience. Is one huge country, where there is a lack of good professional accredited coaching certification and real professional workshops. CTI is not well known in Brazil like it is in Europe and the US. I know I can help some people to find there way to a professional coaching successful life, and I could help CTI to explore this better in that country, and in other countries too. I know there are some CTI leaders doing the workshops in Sao Paulo, and one of my clients,   Marcos Panassol from PWC,  preferred to do his first workshop in the USA for instance, once he couldn't do it in Rio, and he didn't want to do it in SP; he finally started his Fundamentals in Washington DC last month with my recommendation. I have been invited for seminars about coaching at PUC University in Rio, so I feel that students in Psychology are interested in the process, also the faculty. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
