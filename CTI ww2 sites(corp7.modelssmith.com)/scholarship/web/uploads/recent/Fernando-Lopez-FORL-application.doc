Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I make many of my decisions based on the learning I will get and the level of excitement that that generates. Becoming a FORL (and being a FORL) would be an unparalleled learning experience in co-facilitation and front of the room presence. Both are qualities that I'm excited to develop further.     There are also the places I will travel to and the people I will meet along the way. At this time, the expansion into Mexico (my country of origin) is especially drawing me to the role, as are New York and other places. Who knows what even one of those connections could plant the seed for. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>At a time when so many of us get caught up in adopting society's unexamined images of success, the prospect of helping people develop their own inner compass is essential. Organizations (and the world itself) need people who can lead in a new direction--without being overwhelmed or paralysed by the circumstances.     The magic of CTI workshops lies not only in the power of one-on-one coaching, but also in the power of being seen and supported by an entire group of people. As a FORL, I want to be an active part of this magic.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>In comparison to others who are ""corporate refugees"", I'm generally very comfortable coaching inside the corporate world.

For example, we deepen one of his peak experiences to the point where he understands it more profoundly and connects it with his life purpose. Then I start to forward the action--what could he do or create if he followed it? If he thought about dedicating his life to it, what comes up? By bringing him to the edge of expressing this out into the world, we're then able to create further learning from the inner challenge he will need to surmount.     I do this while holding the 4 cornerstones. In particular I appreciated how I held the cornerstone of addressing the whole person. When my client's ""mind"" runs out of information, the body, and the spirit have more to offer. Actually, thinking about this cornerstone in this way is solidifying something new in me. I'm going to be able to hold all of my client's aspects (mind, body, emotions, and spirit) more intentionally. While the client got a lot of new learning from paying attention to his body and emotional wisdom, I could have gone further into his spiritual self when I connected the work he was doing to his life purpose.    The other moment that stood out for me in the recording is the place where I ask which of 3 aspects does he want to explore further and he says ""Magic"". Then I catch myself being very transparent saying ""Yes, I wanted you to say Magic"". This feels a bit lacking in self management--as if I'm voting on the direction of his exploration and potentially getting in his way. If I ask myself what's really behind what I said, I would have to say it's intuition (intuition that that would be a powerful direction to explore). If I were to do it over again I would say instead ""My intuition is telling me that that's a powerful direction to explore too--let's see what we find..."".     All of these reflections will help me be a better coach.
