Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My head Level 1 response is this: since my Fundamentals workshop, I have known this is my work - CTI has given my function a powerful form, and it's a clear way I can bring my work to the world.  With a familial history that includes ministers, Jungian therapists, psychiatrists, doctors and more, this is my form and expression of serving others and indeed the world.  With a personal background in business (sales, finance, hospitality, professional services) and psychology (counseling and organizational psych), FORL work allows me to combine my experience, passion and credibility into a fierce forum that asks others to explore their edges, dream big and long for a world we all want to live in.  I love it!  I also love coaching clients who are longing for more - adventure, clarity, love - and FORL work brings this home and into the world at the same time.      This is also part of my evolution.  Having been a coach for close to 10 years and a FORL leader and facilitator for transformational learning/events in a variety of organizations and contexts for over 13 years, this offers the next step. To co-lead the training of an army of co-active coaches and leaders and to be a powerful catalyst to seeing them learn it, live it and lead by it fills my bucket beyond imagination! Having had my experience of CTI and consciously bringing co-activity to others through my coaching and FORL Leadership work in the past couple of years has been immensely filling.  And I want more. Now I want to train people in the co-active way so they become powerful voices and bodies of this work.    My heart Level 1 response is a swelling vibration in the chest, tingles in the scalp, and fireflies behind the eyelids.  Yellow, orange, red, green, purple and white!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>In so many different parts of the world, I have encountered people longing for a new way to live, love and engage their best selves and others, and they just don't know how.   What I have witnessed is a lack of connection, unclear purpose and a vacuum of clarity, passion and fulfillment - both in individuals and in corporations/organizations across Canada and into the US.  There is a palpable longing. And, there are too few forums to have these safe, whole conversations, where limits can be stretched, where possibilities and fear can share the same space, and where we are held whole amidst failure and championed to rise up and go for it again.  This is true in families, communities, organizations and indeed countries.  The longing asks for the space and "how-to," and co-active events give both with powerful leadership and modeling.  Further, So much of the world doesn't know how to clean up messes that get made and create from whatever is here now, and bringing the Co-Active model to others gives them some tools to do so.      When we train co-activity, it applies to the client/participant/leader's whole life.  As they mylenate their vagus nerve (yes, I'm a big advocate and practitioner of Ann Betz's work on co-activity and neuroscience) they cannot help but be more open, in touch and aware with the entire world.  And this leads people to more self-awareness, connection and consciousness - evoking transformation.  With the windows of self-awareness, connection and consciousness thrown open, more powerful, resonant and creative choices can be made which will further the momentum started 20 years ago in tilting the planet.  The world longs to have a more rich experience of life, in each moment, living from the most powerful voices available.  In short, going from a life of skim milk to table cream, and I see myself as another vibrant catalyst in the powerful Co-Active movement.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>There are 9 examples below:  - Since May of 2012, I have been co-leading several waves of a 6 month leadership program for leaders in a large telecommunications company.  The participants are Managers through to VP's, and the program includes a 3-day intensive, in-room program and then team coaching at 2, 4 and 6 month intervals.  The program follows the model of Personal Leadership (create from self), Team Leadership (which is all about coaching - Create from Other) and Organizational Leadership (Create from Change/Everything). As part of the pilot team, the success of our engagement has lead to more than 200 leaders participating in the program. Personally, the co-active leadership I have brought to the room and team coaching has lead to very strong references and accolades from the client, and I am considered core faculty as the program continues grow.  - With a mid-sized Financial Services company, I co-lead a similar program (as above - 3-days intensive, Personal, Team, Organizational Leadership; group coaching) over 8 months with leaders ranging from Senior Managers to SVP's.  There was a stronger emphasis on coaching in this culture and as a result of our work and my impact, I am currently coaching several VP's one-on-one using the co-active model as they develop their personal leadership, clarity and impact.  - With my in-between partner from Leadership, we co-created and co-lead an experiential workshop focused on creating deeper team connection through shared vulnerability, innovation and how to read the L3 to inform decisions and take action (in three organizations in Canada and the U.S.).  This worked laid the foundation for both of us to weave co-active leadership principles more deeply into additional work we are doing  - With a leading independent school (non-profit) in Canada, I conducted, on 4 occasions, an experiential learning program to help the school understand and align candidates' leadership qualities and characteristics as an essential component to the school's search for a new CEO.  This process helped the selection committee create a powerful connection between what "their heads" wanted, and what "their hearts" knew.  From there, a powerful choice was made.  The school was thrilled with our work over those 3 months and I have since joined the board to work with other business leaders on enhancing and furthering the mission of the institution.  - In a Global Professional Services Company, I co-lead a coaching skills development workshop/program with another CPCC and then worked as the lead team coach to further strengthen the skills of more than 150 leaders across the country.  Through live video conference and in person sessions, this group coaching work (done in circles across the country) received average effectiveness ratings of 88%+ and my work as a co-active coach was recorded to serve as a training resource to help skill up in-house team coaches across the organization  - With another CPCC and Leadership Grad, co-designed and co-lead 3-modules of a 5-module leadership program for emerging leaders at BMW Canada.  This required us to co-create with the organization's leaders.  Using co-active leadership principles, we focused on developing a clear sense of leader values, leader purpose, supporting habits and rituals, positive/co-active communication and the lens of neuroscience on leader practice, impact and change initiatives.  The success of our first cohort has lead to another cohort kicking off in September and the request to design "next level" leadership modules for graduates of the first program.  - With a tribe mate (Birch tribe), co-designed a leadership workshop for an International Manufacturing organization focused on how to successfully lead from trust and through conflict.  Using co-active leadership principles, we intentionally designed space (geography) and the ARC of the workshop to engage and stretch the comfort of participants and create a range of experiences over a day.  We have been requested to come back and do more work with the team on how to deepen engagement, accountability and results in a more collaborative (co-active) culture.  - With a global consumer package goods company, co-lead three offsites for two of the most senior leadership teams which focused on valuing people for their strengths and needs, the power of effective communication (acknowledgement, yes and, 3-levels of listening), the team's ability to shift perspectives in fast changing environments.  During that time, I was asked to coach 3 executives to deepen their work and effectiveness as leaders.  - Co-lead an innovation workshop with 300 leaders of a major Canadian retailer using the power of a Leader Stake (with a non-CTI trained co-leader), ARC's and Create from Everything to overcome challenges created by external circumstances in timing, energy and morale.  Created an experience which helped point the way to several key innovation ideas which helped set the foundation for the organization's cultural transformation.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

A few moments later, Dancing in This Moment on a pause opens up the topic of how she stays small or "in neutral" in the relationship, as experienced in the session (metaview).  The use of Curiousity and the power of Articulate What's Going On ("keeping yourself neutral for him and the relationship") creates a new direction for the coaching and deepens the learning.   In some moments of Process, there is a slow and steady pace with the use of Embodiment to have the client name/experience the feeling in the moment.  There is also acknowledgement of values and the disconnect at present. For the sake of the Evoking Transformation through Process and Fulfillment, I take charge and the focus shifts to a much more resonance perspective and the client being "back in the game."    To increase the effectiveness of the co-active coaching, I am continuing to focus on more straight-forward, powerful questions e.g.  ""What's getting in your way of going all the way there tonight?""  Further, speaking the hard truth of my observations more directly could have the coaching move forward more clearly and quickly.  Also, naming of Saboteur more directly when she says she says it "feels selfish to expect that (and, the ""articulate what's going on"" helps hold that up to the light).  Staying in the body longer on sadness and disappointment and where "being alive" is felt could deepen it further as well.  And finally, let her "take the game" to the next place as opposed to offering a topic she mentioned early on would also have me Dance more purely in This Moment.    Where the coaching ended up - a powerful new perspective on building relationships, sourcing personal power, trusting self and building that into an inspiring direction.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
