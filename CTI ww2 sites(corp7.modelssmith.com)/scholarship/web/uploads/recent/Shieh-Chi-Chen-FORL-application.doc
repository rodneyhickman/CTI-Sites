What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>All the diversity programs I delivered in the United States was done as part of an ethnically and gender diverse team.  My partners were awesome individuals with very diverse life experiences and we played off of each other as we worked with different clients across the US.     I really enjoy working in corporate Canada and United States.  Managers/leaders in corporations have a very special role in the economy and their community as they work flat out delivering on their organizational goals sometimes to the determent of their own life goals.  These managers need to be acknowledged, supported and nurtured as they strive for excellence.  I consider it my mission to empower and enrich them through my coaching and in my training programs.       </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Please listen to it from 10mins to 25 mins.  Thank you!    The client's name is Joanne and the coaching conversation is about her relationship with her daughter, setting boundaries for herself and being okay with it.       What was effective on the call:  - good acknowledgement of the client; I acknowledged Joanne for recognizing the situation and taking action   - good summary of situation with her daughter; Joanne discussed the specifics of the situation in great detail during our last call so during this call, I kept bringing her attention back to the big picture ie. Cyclical nature of issue   - I stayed focused on the relationship with her daughter even though she did bring up her relationship patterns with her former husband  - Keeping the discussion at the personal level even though as a nurse, Joanne was using some clinical language i.e. codependent, "important dimensions"  -  Created the space for Joanne to come up with her own next steps on how to resolve the angst for herself through Meditation and journaling.  There was a great amount of positive energy when Joanne talked about journaling.  I felt my direction to brainstorm and write all associated thoughts in relation to her daughter was a good one as writing can be cathartic and free association may pop up issues and concerns Joanne may not be aware of.       What was not effective on the call:  - I interrupted her more than I expected.  Sometimes the interruption was my agreement i.e. "yes" but unfortunately the on the call it disrupted the client's flow  - I need to ask more questions and to rephrase some of my summations into a questioning format.    - My summations could be shorter and more succinct.  I notice that I am sometimes struggling for the right word and so I use too many of them.  - I notice that I sometimes come across as judgmental even though that is not my intention.  I need to be more careful of my voice, tone and intonation.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
