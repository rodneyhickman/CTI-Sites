Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My journey with CTI started in April 2012, since then I was going back to back with the core curriculum, certification and leadership.. I am so passionate about CTI's work, it made me connect with myself and re discover who I am. Accordingly I have a great desire to share this learning with people as much as I can. Also, giving that my life purpose is that "I am the church bell that awaken your inner power to accept yourself and accept others to live in peace and harmony", I feel being front of the room leader will give me a further chance to connect with my life purpose and in fact live on purpose. I like working with groups and I like learning from others and I believe CTI's front of the room leader provides theses opportunities too. On another note, I have a dream to work with CTI to deliver the programs in Arabic in the entire Arab world, this is a long process and being front of the room leader will help to achieve this dream. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

I didn't settle with the subject from the first time as it didn't feel real. I blurted my intuition to name the subject and the client response was "spot on".     After the client agreed on the subject she asked me to explain what I meant, I feel I could've talk a bit less and let the client do the work and explain in her own words rather me explaining.     I was not attached to the coaching subject, I was working with the client as whole, and I was evoking transformation rather fixing issues.      I brought the client values during the session (example efficiency). I did articulate what the client was saying using my own words. I used a lot of curiosity and asked open ended questions things such "I am curious what in it for you?", "who are you being?", "what is change?", "what is your best?" and at the end of the coaching "what's important for you in all of this?".     I used intuition several times "I am getting the image that you are trying to link your heart to your brain". However I felt I over spoke while explaining my intuition, probably I could speak a bit less.       I felt at minute 13:17 that I was thinking of what question I should ask next and, I used the voice "mmmmm" to buy time, I am not sure maybe I went to level one. However, I obviously applied self management and recovered quickly and re connected on level 2 & 3.     At minute 14 I felt the client was going in circle, so I used intrude, I asked to stop coming from her head and instead connect with her heart. To do that I did embodiment by asking her to put her hand on her heart, a bit of visualization by breathing from there and I asked her to answer from heart.     When I asked the client twice to answer my question about "what is your best", I felt I might have had an agenda, i.e. I could dance more in this moment with the client.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
