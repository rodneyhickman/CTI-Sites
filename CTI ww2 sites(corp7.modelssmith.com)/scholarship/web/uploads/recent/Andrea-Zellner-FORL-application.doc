Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I have realized that not only am I am passionate about and powerful in coaching, but I also have a huge urge to share, to teach.  CTI trainings open new world for people; I know it did for me, and I want to be part of that.  I believe it would be hugely rewarding to me and those in my classes.      I think I would be an excellent FORL because of my deep intuition, L3 attention, caring, ferocity, heart and power, my courage and resilience.  I would be a real asset to CTI's international presence as I am multicultural, having  grown up in the US (New York state) and lived the past 25 abroad, mostly in France but also in Switzerland and Brazil.  I have always been able to connect with people from different backgrounds and at all levels in an organization and have worked with CEOs to middle managers in a variety of industries including NGOs.      I am very aligned with CTI's values and goals in terms of trainings, and believe we would be a good fit.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>My being a CTI FORL is needed in the space! It is aligned with my mission to contribute to evolution.    I believe there is a deep longing in people and organizations for authenticity and connection.  Organizations are needing these and other ""soft"" skills from their managers and leaders to ""capture the hearts and minds"" of their people.  Employees want to be heard, inspired and feel their managers care and can be trusted.  CTI coaching and leadership training have a role to play in shifting the organizational reality to better unleash the potential of their people.  I feel these needs very deeply and want to bring my talents and gifts towards creating more consciousness in work.    I  have a powerful urge to work with leaders to help them gain the tools and consciousness to (here I quote Nick Kettles:) ""...empower people to take ownership as stakeholders in our collective future.""  The name of my company is Conscious Imperatives for I believe that as we become more conscious we gain a sense of responsibility for what we create, hence the imperative to create something of value on all levels, and our world is so needing that.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Dancing in the moment,  I consistently picked up on what she said and helped her articulate even more.  I was coaching fulfillment, and encouraged her to feel what she was describing, to explore what is possible and help her see who she is and what are her gifts.  I used powerful questions, intuition, geography, deep listening, curiosity, deepening the learning and forwarding the action and values work.  I took charge and created a safe and courageous space, and gave her lots of space.     I missed the opportunity to explore her learning from her homework and to celebrate her for saying no and speaking with her boss.  I acknowledged her, and could have done more.  There are places I could have taken her even deeper into the feeling and experience to get to a really resonant place. I could have used the potential metaphors of the disruption of the construction noise or the bings from an Iphone.  I didn't celebrate her as much as I could have.  Speaking of being heard was perhaps more consulting.      I hope you listen to 18 minutes or so, as the it got better.
