Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The feelings, the emotions are as palpable today as they were when I first discovered CTI Coaching back in 2006 and the invaluable service the leaders brought into my life through Co-Activity.    The timing is perfect.  All systems are in place.    This is my part of  "Be the Change you want to see in the World".    I would like to incorporate all 50 reasons above into my Level 3 answer as well and even add a few.      Assisting humanity, one soul at a time, into returning to or rediscovering their truth, their true self, their essence would be an honor and a privilege AND it is my calling.    Through being a CTI FORL my abilities to engage, connect, dance and lead the participants into a safe space in which to grow, to expand and reconnect to that part within themselves that some have forgotten and others never consciously aware of yet are striving to return.    Being in relationship with people helps us to know ourselves.  I know in my head, as well as in my heart that we are ONE.  I'm looking for experiences to live it.  To walk my talk.  To connect with individuals on a deep and meaningful level which becomes who I am.  I'm close, it's in there.   It's there at times.  I want it more.  People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.    Still a bit of Level 1, but being in service brings it to Level 3.      Just one more reason.  I believe to really know something it helps greatly   to teach it.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Coach jumps right in with "What's that about?"  Simple enough, yet direct and wanting clarification for herself and client before asking what is the Topic of Focus for today's coaching.  Perhaps coach could have stayed with the client's feeling of lack of motivation.  Coach clarifies and has client sum up what he wants coaching on which is a good way to start the session.  When client changes the topic, coach articulates the disparity.     Sensing the client's low energy, coach asks "what needs to happen" to have a good coaching session, putting the power onto the coachee.  Taking charge and in a straight forward yet humorous manner, coach asks the client if he wants to make use of the next 15 minute, again power with client. "Not a very nice place to be, is it?"  asks the coach with Empathy/Understanding. Coach explains "Down the Tube" trying to "train the client" on Process Coaching while articulating what is going on.            What are you physically feeling?  Could have kept going with that line of questioning, leading the client into his body to explore what's there.  Clearly the saboteur was present and coach was aware not to coach that. "That wouldn't be right?" coach simply repeats clients words for elaboration which enables the client to see the effects of his last comment.    Coach allows client space.  Using client's words, coach metaphorically asks  "What would uplift you?"  Back to the tube, as client's demeanor was still in a heavy place.  How low down the tube are you?  Have you been in this place before?  A great question as it leads the client to a YES, YES, YES. Coach picks up on the energy shift and Client has an amazing realization of wanting to be enjoying the work he is doing.    When were you doing alright?  Great chance for fulfillment coaching. Could have gone deeper.  Get client feel the moment more fully.  Saboteur rears his head and coach pushes on while agreeing that client may "just need a holiday" attitude and challenges him to find the motivation now (keeping the focus) before the vacation.  Client agrees. Nice notice of coach picking up and articulating what brought the client alive with regard to work. Great question with "what is routine in your life?"    Coach gives a big challenge which client counter offers and coach asks if he needs support/accountability.  Sets up back up inquiry as homework and asks client to verbalize what he is taking away.      All in all a good 20 minutes well spent.  As mentioned above, could have assisted client into becoming more present and aware with deeper process and even fulfillment coaching.  Did, however, forward the action and deepened the learning.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
