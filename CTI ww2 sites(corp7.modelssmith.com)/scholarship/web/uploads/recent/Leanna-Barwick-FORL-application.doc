As an employee I've worked in a variety of positions, pay scales, and  work cultures, and been exposed to work life from many different angles.    These experiences contribute to my overall connect-ability to my clients, because I get what they are going through when they feel challenged around values, wanting to make a difference, have work-life balance, make the best of any situation they are in, and be in positions where they make difficult choices.    Professionally, I've started to work with teams, that are willing to organize around values, and be mission driven. Typically this is not-for-profit, and more lately, social entrepreneurs.    I have coached leadership teams, fund raising teams, Board of Directors, small family business, and HIV support groups.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I'm an engaging personality. I'm friendly, hospitable, and take this attitude where ever I go. I believe everyone has something to teach and learn.    I truly hold the system as the client (one of the ORSC corner stones). Everyone holds a piece of the truth - partially. I hold that the commitment to designed alliance and working Co-Actively is the key that starts the engine of team success.     I challenge in a way that opens up the space and provokes deeper thought. I'm not intimidated by conflict, that is how the system creates the change that is needed.    I empower authentic leadership in every team member. And enroll the team on stretching from the comfort zones to reach goals, and supporting every member's growth .    My goal is to humanize work life.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

I wasn't set on using one principle specifically. Aspects of principles were integrated throughout the session as they served that particular moment. I used all the Co-Active coaching skills, some more than others. Geography was used to shift perspectives, more than exploring physical geography. Not much metaphor use, and the metaphor I did use fell flat. I incorporated that flatness into my next question, which led the coaching session to a new place of resonant discovery.    If I was to look at it from the angle of what wasn't Co-Active, it is that I talked too much, taking up space with my tid-bits of wisdom, and not holding the client fully NCRW to speak her own. There were missed opportunity to ask deeper more powerful questions, and a moment where I intended to intrude take charge, and the impact was actually more interruptive to client's flow.    Overall, I felt connected to my Co-Active stake and the client's agenda throughout this session. I recovered quickly when I missed a beat, finding and connecting to the L2 energy. I coached the client not the topic. I blurted my intuition, and wasn't attached to being right. I matched her energy, and I turned up the volume when the L3 needed it. The client left the call educated on Co-Active coaching, and definitely more alive, aware, and filled with a new sense of purpose and commitment to her own self-growth.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
