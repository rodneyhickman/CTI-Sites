Level 1 response: : <br /><b>From the very beginning of my relationship with CTI in Fundamentals, I could see myself sitting in the Leader chair co-creating with another amazing co-leader. I so get the dance - and I am endlessly captivated by it.     I love connecting deeply and authentically with people, and I am passionate about facilitating learning. There is nowhere I'm happier than swimming in the space of people engaged in expanding what's possible in their lives, and helping guide the flow of their learning. And I am exhilarated by my own journey to keep growing!  I'm clear that training others in the co-active skills I have acquired will help me integrate them on an even deeper level, and provide a fabulous opportunity to continue standing more fully in my own Leadership.     Most of all - I feel absolutely called to this work! Connecting people with co-activity and helping them build the skills to no kidding bring it into the world is completely aligned with my life purpose to inspire others to step fully into their lives and make a difference in the world. When I visualize co-creating with other powerful leaders and getting to fall in love repeatedly with the people, the process and the magic that unfolds in a CTI classroom - I really can't imagine anything better!   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>STAKE: I am a powerful, engaging, enrolling and deeply connected Leader - claimin' it! I bring a passion that is compelling and contagious, a fierce commitment to calling forth the best in people, a low tolerance for bullshit, and a huge desire to influence authentic connection in the world.     The impact of my showing up in this way is that it inspires people to engage, to step out of their comfort zone, to rethink what's possible and to reach for possibility and transformation.    The bigger impact is that when people are mindful of how they're showing up and connected with the tools to choose skillfully in each moment - more peace is created in every facet of their lives, and by extension on the planet. When we stop bashing into each other in conflict and open up to truly seeing each other, when we start connecting with ourselves, and others, from our power instead of through our crap and our egos, the space becomes rich with possibility. I believe that co-activity is a direct path to promoting this needed - and so wanted - shift in the world, and that opportunities to bring co-activity in service of this shift's unfolding are expanding all around us.     The more people trained in this way of being - the more chance we have of righting the ship. I am committed to doing everything in my power to restore harmony, connection and love on this planet. I choose to create an impact by being a part of the solution, and one significant way I want to achieve this is through front of the room leading with CTI.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>Personal Development Workshops:    October 2012 / January 2013  Co-facilitated two 1- day workshops with a partner trained in co-activity that were focused on expanding perspective, promoting engaged listening and fostering authentic communication.      February 2012  Contracted by Soul Works Retreats to teach a creativity component of a women's health and wellness workshop.      Painting Workshops:    September 2011 and 2012  Two heli-painting workshops - guiding painters in mountainous terrain over a 3 day period to paint and get connected with the landscape on a variety of levels. These workshops were co-facilitated with another instructor. In addition to painting instruction, we co-lead open, interactive group discussions about the challenges and rewards of the creative journey.     September 2012  Co-facilitated with 4 instructors: We taught 80 students over 5 days in a variety of mediums. This workshop called for balancing my own approach and methodology with that of the other instructors in order to create an environment where the students were able to integrate learning from each unique teaching approach and blend this into their own work.    In addition I have taught 13 independently led painting 3-5 day workshops with an average of 12 students in each. The way I facilitate my painting workshops incorporates a very co-active approach. I begin with an opening circle that inspires a willingness in students to be vulnerable and and courageous as they share what they want to get from the workshop. I also lead lively debriefs between exercises to integrate the learning as we go, and end with an enlightening closing circle where students share their key take-aways. In building trust and connection within the participant group, as well as between the participants and myself, a rich learning environment is created where mistakes are welcome, stepping out of comfort zones is strongly encouraged and supported, and the pathways to creativity remain wide open.      Back of the room leading:  In the past year and a half I have assisted 8 - three day CTI Core Curriculum courses in Calgary. I completed my CPCC certification just as the new model was being introduced, and I chose to assist in order to get a firm grounding in and solid understanding of the new model, as well as to continue to build my skill as a coach.     I loved assisting and participating as new coaches were being trained in the co-active model, and I found it super valuable to observe the leaders co-creating and dancing together as they juggled the timeline, the curriculum and the other vast and varied elements of leading a CTI course unfolding.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Many of my past experiences have given me skills that I believe make me well equipped to step effectively into this work:    My career as a fine artist has honed my creative and intuitive skills. I have learned to blend this with a pragmatic approach to working with analytical thinkers in a way that enables them to expand their thinking processes in holistic ways.     My role as a lead guide in a heli-hiking organization called for being tuned into and managing the dynamics between managers, pilots, guides and lodge staff. It was essential to have a stake (unconscious) that honoured the chain of command in place, and the many personality differences present, for the sake of creating a spirit of harmonious co-operation that enabled each person to bring their own unique value and the best use of their skills to the table.    In my capacity as a guide with my own groups, many of my guests were successful executives and entrepreneurs used to being in charge and in control. I often guided groups who worked together and had a hierarchy within the group such as Stanford Alumni, groups of physicians, and smaller independent companies on retreat. In order to be effective, I had to instill trust that I could help them safely and successfully achieve often daunting goals which required connecting with their inner strengths and resourcefulness, pushing out of their comfort zones and being willing to be led.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I am resourceful, adaptable and wide open to being coached and trained.     I'm eager and enthusiastic about continuing to broaden and deepen the ways that I can contribute to spreading co-activity in the world, and I'm dedicated to applying my own time and resources to gain the experience required to be a solid co-active leader - both within and outside of organizations.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Prior to the clip starting point, we had clarified the client's agenda: she was wanting to explore a concern she was having around recently accepting a job in real estate, and a 'nagging voice' that it might prevent her from making room for painting/art in her life.     All elements of the Co-Active Coaching model were clearly present in the coaching. In addition the coaching relationship was granted power - there was trust, connection, and a willingness to explore.    Here are some elements that made the coaching most powerful and the tools that were used to create this:    The clip starts with my intruding to get under what she was confused by. Articulating what was going on was used to name where she was feeling stuck, and process was used as we dove in to explore what was unfolding. There was a lot of aliveness as we really danced together in the moment, and through curious, powerful questions the client gained clarity on what made her feel alive and fulfilled, and what she felt called forth to. As we distinguished between her saboteur voices and what was really true for her, and I used acknowledgement and championing to call her forth, I could feel her starting to stand in her wisdom. I followed my intuition that there was a better choice than obliterating the saboteur - I held a bigger vision for her that she could be with the fear in a powerful way. I sensed and acted on the opportunity to really build the resonance of this.     There was some taking charge present, and with a great use of metaphor and increasing embodiment, the client gained a metaview that got her deeply connected with how powerful she was in relation to her saboteurs, and transformed her from being afraid of them to knowing that she was in charge. She was then inspired to choose and create from that place. As we integrated the learning in building a structure for her to stay connected with her power, she came up with an action step that was a stand for what she wanted to create in her life. We finished with a compelling acknowledgment of who she was and how she showed up in her life, and in the coaching relationship.    Misses and missteps:  Some of my questions could have been shorter, clearer and more direct. I missed a great opportunity to use geography as we built the metaphor of standing on a high cliff and then flying. There was a place where I did more telling/stating than asking. ""You get you are amused because you so know this isn't true, right?"" Curiosity was missing here. More powerful would have been ""What is amusing for you about this?"" or ""What else is in here besides amusement?"" Accountability: The 'when' was there regarding ordering the canvas, and more powerful accountability would have included: ""When will you start the painting?"" And added to both questions, ""How will I know?""    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
