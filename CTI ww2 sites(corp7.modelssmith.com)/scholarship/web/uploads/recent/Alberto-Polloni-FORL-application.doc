Level 1 response: : <br /><b>This work is my biggest passion.    During completion back on my own Fundamentals in 2005 , I said "I feel at home and doing exactly what I need now for my life purpose." That day, I decided to be a great Co-Active coach and part of the CTI community.     Today, I am a proud Co-Active coach and a CTI Certification faculty member, leading pods both in English and Spanish.     I have no words to describe the impact of becoming a CPL has had on my coaching, leadership skills and authenticity. Leading for CTI, combined with my own personal and spiritual path has transformed every aspect of my life to an amazing point of fulfillment.     Last month, when I was journeying Fulfillment my heart started beating fast as I realized how ready I am now to be a front of the room leader.    I want to take my experience of being a CTI leader to the next level. Being a CPL and practicing coaching demos, debriefing experiences, giving feedback, and teaching key distinctions has given me a deep understanding and application of the Co-Active model. I share my experiences with my students, inspiring them to apply the model to every aspect of their lives as well. I consistently receive outstanding scores on my evaluations from both my Spanish and English pods.    I'm ready and inspired to take this experience to the front of the room. As a leader I believe I am inspiring love, trust, personal power, authenticity, acceptance, humor, celebration and compassion for everything we are as human beings. I can't think of anything more fulfilling for me than to train and inspire coaches on the Co-Active model and to find their own amazing power to evoke transformation in their clients and the world.    Being a FORL will have a great impact on my personal coaching practice. I am committed and taking the Co-Active model to the corporate and organizational world, and I know I will grow tremendously as a leader, thus increasing my impact and growth of my company (Trinitaz Coaching Systems).     Being a FORL will give me access to a larger range to continue my work at the next higher level of impact and consciousness. I can't wait. I'm leading, coaching and training in Spanish and English now, and in the next 2-3 years I will be capable to be leading trainings and coaching in Italian and French as well. I'm super excited to support CTI in its global market.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>One of the things I see happening in the world is the way coaching is expanding into more and more countries and regions. One of my contributions to CTI as FORL will be my experience of living, studying and working in four languages and on three continents. I've had the opportunity to break through cultural boundaries to become a multicultural coach and leader. It comes easy and natural to me, and allows me to normalize being different for others; whether different national cultures or different organizational cultures, they all join in the common experience of coaching.    I believe in integrating with different cultures without changing your own - I call it "cultural abundance." This creates freedom, creativity, authenticity and joy. The focus is not in our differences but integration from of our commonalities as we grow together by learning from our differences    I also see the power of coaching to create world peace and synergy through the awareness that we as human beings are all brothers and sisters. Working together in a Co-Active way creates respect, integration, appreciation and love each for other at a time the world needs it very much. This is the deep passion of my own life--the awareness that we are one at our core.    I also am aware of the way coaching is growing from personal to organizational, and I see huge opportunities and needs here to bring what is best from "life coaching" to the needs of organizations, both by internal and external coaches. This means once again looking for the commonalities to integrate and grow from differences, inspiring a culturally inclusive, adaptable and integrative model. I bring a great deal of experience and expertise in this area from my background in business, having successfully created and run my own design and branding company for 16 years, as well as coaching and training as a consultant.       My dream as a FORL leader also includes creating, promoting, celebrating and embracing diversity at CTI worldwide and expanding the Co-Active model to Chile, Argentina and Italy.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

The topic is lunching her business with more confidence. The recording starts when she is responding to the question of "how is your experience of starting your own business?"     What worked?     1.	Tracking the energy of my client, acknowledging and being with it  2.	Intuition hits, listening L3, naming and articulating.   3.	Dealing and bypassing her saboteur, finding her right.  4.	Taking charge, like telling her that we would not go into the detail of the business and creating the metaphor/meta-view of the hot air balloon.  5.	Holding Cornerstones, acknowledging, embodiment/geography.  6.	Powerful questions, articulating and making powerful distinctions.  7.	Checking with her in level 3 and deepening the learning asking her "what is opening up to you with this conversation?"  8.	Holding the client's agenda and persistently going into coaching the client while honoring the topic.      What would I do different or more of?    1.	Lean more into the Principle of Fulfillment; do life purpose, naming and articulating more values. Create more resonance.  2.	Allow more Process space to feel integration of business/volunteering/making money. To be "the center of the universe"  3.	I would not tell her that I was going to ask her 2 questions and then not asking the second one.  4.	Talk less, shorten the questions or instructions a couple of times.  5.	Interrupt a couple of stories about particles and saboteur voice.  6.	Slow down; do not interrupt the resonant and transformative moments.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
