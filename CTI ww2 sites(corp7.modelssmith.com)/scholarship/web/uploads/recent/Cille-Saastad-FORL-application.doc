Level 1 response: : <br /><b>From the first time I attended Fundamentals I was hooked and became a CTI junkie. I believe that the period that I took the five coaching courses was one of the most rewarding, exciting and fulfilling times of my life. I am not kidding. The atmosphere that is created in the CTI settings is magical and transformative and I want to be part of this on a regular basis. I know I have the skills and the right attitude to become a very proficient leader.  And most importantly I have a big heart and a big motivation to help people grow and become the best version of themselves.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>When I visualise myself in the ring, on a chair, at the front of the room, I get goose bumps and my heart starts beating faster. To have the opportunity to lead and dance is like a dream come true, and I get really emotional right now. Sensing and listening to the excitement, the fright, the love and the anticipation and dancing with that will be different each time but so fulfilling to lead people through the same "theoretical" CTI path. My curiosity and excitement level is heading for the moon when I envision getting to peak into many different hearts and in that process getting to know myself even better. A feeling of gratefulness and anticipation is wrapping around me and I hear voices saying yes, yes, yes.

What was good about the coaching: I was curious and asked many powerful questions like: What is this really about? What is important about this? What else? What are you afraid of? What's exciting? A couple of times I summarized. I pointed out to him how this job aligned with his values. I could of course had asked him what values are present in this job, instead of me pointing it out. I was dancing with him but still holding the focus on values and fulfilment in this job. I acknowledged and articulated what was going on, pointing to his confidence and energy and smile. Using a scale for his confidence having him acknowledging that there is not so much to be afraid of.    What could have been better: He came up with the topic for coaching, but I think we could have agreed on it, making sure I understood what was the issue so the coaching could have been even more focused. I asked him a couple of time how he felt and there I could have gone deeper into his feelings. I could also have used metaphors to have him describe his uneasiness with the job. I could have acknowledged him for taking the risk of applying for a job that he feels is a bit over his head. I could have asked him questions like: What will this job do for you to have him feel the excitement, but I really think I got there with my other powerful questions.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
