Level 1 response: : <br /><b>From the first ten minutes of my Fundamentals course in January 2008, I have known that I was born to sit in front of a CTI room, and have set myself on a course that has included Certification, Leadership, assisting Leadership, Ambassadorship, getting in front of as many rooms as possible with a co-leader, co-leading with three current CTI leaders, and getting all the way to the final round of the recent Leadership Leader auditions.  I then proposed to Henry that I be allowed to attend the training for the new Leadership Leaders; this led to the public marketing of the Leadership Way.  I will assist this in mid-July.  I am ecstatically happy to be a part of it.      I have two main life purposes, which became clear as I moved through Core and Leadership:  "I see you, I love you, I grow you" and "I create circles of belonging that grow people."  There is no organization in the world that delivers on my personal missions and soul longings better than CTI.      As a psychotherapist as well as a coach who has studied and utilized many other models of personal growth and transformation, the Co-Active Model is remarkable in its depth and applicability across cultures and circumstances.  It transforms and heals, and its cornerstones should be the foundation for all work with humans.     I have assisted a vast number of times for CTI; I love being in the circle, behind the circle, in front of the circle.  I love the energy and the love that hums and thrums as the room comes alive with the learning and the power and spaciousness of authenticity, transformation, and connection.   I feel intense joy and pleasure in holding the space for the magic that moves through the hearts, minds, bodies and souls connected in the room.  I come alive as the participants come alive.      The design of the courses is impeccable.  Each are high art and I am a budding artist.  I am hungry to co-create with the other FORLs, who provide the greatest adult learning experience I have ever witnessed.  I love to travel and meet people and I would be humbled and overjoyed to be a part of this movement.     I will continue to create circles of belonging that grow people for the rest of my life.  I am a catalyst for a global transformation.  I am co-creating a world that is creative rather than reactive, with thriving societies that celebrate love, not fear, where dreams of social justice are realized and where there is a blend of masculine and feminine energies and strengths.      As a FORL for CTI, I will use my innate gift of seeing and loving and drawing out the talent and passion in people.  I have spent my entire career doing just this in a wide variety of ways.  I will raise consciousness and co-activity in these coaches and leaders, who will then impact their respective worlds in a powerful and positive way.  I truly believe that Co-Activity can transform the planet, and I am committed to devoting my life to ensuring that transformation happens.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I have a thriving coaching practice that at this point is fueled almost completely by referrals and word-of-mouth.  I attract everyone from moms of teenage girls (I coach two of them!) to 55-year-old C-Suite Executives.  I have never struggled for clients and market very little.       In the three years that I have been creating and co-leading Co-Active Workshops, I have filled every event that I have put on a calendar. I have already co-led with some of the "greats"-Rick Tamlyn, Art Shirk, and L.A. Reding.      Since I became Co-Ambassador for Boston less than one year ago, FUNS attendance numbers are at 167% of this time last year.  I was invited to become the Ambassador and told Nick that I would not do it without a co-leader.  I walk the talk and the people around me are drawn to it and to me.    Boston (and beyond) is hungry for Co-Activity and coaching, and I am its successful conduit.  Me + Co-Active = It's in the space! ?    People are longing to move through their lives authentically, in concert with their values, at choice, and fully present to life.  Every time a course happens, transformation is evoked and the world becomes a more balanced, creative, gentle, and joyful place.    Boston is the seat of higher learning and technology in North America.  It is also deeply caught in the seduction of the mind, thinking, and head, and it longs for a more integrated approach to life and business.  As Boston goes, the rest of the country and world will follow.   Situated where I live and work in Cambridge, equidistant to Harvard and MIT, I am uniquely positioned, physically and psychically, to transmit Co-Active to thought leaders, academics, and inventors.    The Co-Active way can heal the planet; consciousness-raising and transformation on a global scale is what is wanted by humanity, by the Earth, and by Spirit.  The impact of CTI's programs is already rippling out exponentially and globally.  The Universe wants more, and it wants me as one of its Co-Active messengers.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have coached couples in my private practice.  I have provided coaching to the corporate/non-profit leaders where I have given workshops.  In many of these workshops, I taught basic coaching skills and have coached people in front of the room numerous times.  I taught a coaching course for the Executive Coaching Program at the MSPP.  I have a great deal of experience coaching groups, work teams, and many, many employees in my 15+ years as a non-profit manager and clinical supervisor.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>Not all of these are specifically coach training; however, they are certainly applicable to both my coaching and my front of the room work.

I may continue with the City of Cambridge on an occasional contract basis which will have no impact on me leading for CTI.    I am a Bigger Game Trainer, which will not interfere with my work for CTI.      I am one of the founders of The Poet's Way and lead trainings for them; however, this will not interfere with my CTI work.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My large body of experience working in a Leadership capacity in various non-profit and government organizations, experiences that ranged from transcendent, ground-breaking and wildly Co-Active to deeply dysfunctional C-Level leadership which I had to navigate and create from. As my resume shows, I was an exceptionally effective leader of large and diverse teams for many years and at my last two managerial roles, was specifically hired to come in and turn around failing flagship teams.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I am confident, capable, and as an Intelligence Type, can appeal to a range of personalities and roles.  I am not intimidated by the dysfunctions, dynamics, and power struggles that play out in many organizations.      In my recent role at the City of Cambridge, I have gone into 20+ different organizations asking for a serious culture shift for most of them.  I have had to work with police, politicians, doctors, and CEOs and bring sometimes-warring factions together at tables in my quest to save lives.  I have been consistently lauded with praise by these power players for the work that I have done in the last two years.      I believe also that I can help bring Co-Active Coaching to some of these entities and organizations.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

If you are only going to listen to 15 minutes, please begin at 10 minutes in and listen to the end.      During this session, I am pleased that all four cornerstones were solidly present.  In the Coaching, I focused mainly on powerful Fulfillment and Process questions.  One thing I noticed in the listening is that I need to work on making my powerful questions pithier and singular!  There were two instances where I noticed that I asked more than one question in rapid succession.  At 9:25, I articulated what was going on, stating "You love both the student who struggles AND the superstar," and then followed it up with two powerful questions.  One "How does that make you feel?" would have sufficed!    There was a lot of saboteur energy present during the first few minutes of the call; I briefly explained the concept of the saboteur to her at 4:30.  The energy and focus really shifted when I asked her about a peak experience/what she really loved about teaching around 7:30 and she told a story resonant with values.       There was a big "gift" at 10:15 where she dropped a giant saboteur bomb and kept talking.  I made a noise but didn't intrude in that moment.  However, I circled back, got curious about it and it ended up being a huge turning point at 12:55--I championed her at 13:55, intuited that she really wanted her work to be seen by a wider audience, and challenged her at 17:28--there was an audible "gulp!"  I got curious about that and named the fact that her voice sounded completely different when shifting to the idea of publishing her work.  I tied it back to her value of communication, justice, and making a difference in the world, which she had articulated earlier in the coaching.      The last few minutes were about making requests, setting up homework and accountability, and a final championing at 24:01--"You've always wanted to be a writer, go do it, girl!"    I would give myself the following advice:  Work on "ums" and other tentative-sounding verbiage.  Use one powerful question at a time.  Deepen the learning even more while forwarding the action.  Dive into the work and topic even more quickly in the beginning.  Use geography and/or metaphor more.  End with more Big A focus-maybe more curiosity about her identity as a writer and who she is becoming.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
