Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I want to be a Front of Room Leader because the first time I attended a course, i experienced the work the Leaders were doing and it felt like it was exactly what i wanted to do ! it was kind of my dream job. It was strange to feel that because at the time i was being trained to be a Yoga Teacher which was my dream job too actually. But the idea of travelling to deliver courses, co-lead, bring people into the experience of the moment and of themselves, have fun, work hard and play, connect with groups of beautiful beings ... woah, it was new to me to even think that a job like that could exist ! It was bringing a new perspective on some of my Yoga teachings too so it was feeling very full and deep. Inspiring people, creating a space where everything is possible and where everyone in the room connects to more of who they really are, evoking transformation, bringing more fulfillment and contributing to developing coaches who come from a Co-Active place, allowing the expansion of the heart and of the being. To me this feels like a fabulous place to be, the right place actually. A sacred place that comes with a lot of responsibility and authenticity... where walking the talk and living from the heart feel like bathing in Essence. And needless to say that with my Yoga background the focus on the whole person is key !</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>My Life Purpose is ""I am the Shaman who connects people to their bodies, their hearts and their souls, to each other and to the environment, in service of global healing"". The part related to Global Healing comes alive in a role like Front of the Room Leader. I believe and feel that We are one, interrelated, interconnected and yet soooo divided and so apart and at war even. In today's world there is such a transition and need for more consciousness, for more wisdom from the heart, for more presence, for more listening, for more love, for more compassion, for more daring fulfillment, for more fierceness in elevating spirits. Contributing to the evolution of consciousness in our times would be a privilege and an honor for me. I would feel very well used being of service to the world by contributing this way !</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have been exposed to relationship coaching a lot as I did the ORSC Training and was actively involved in the Community in paris and organizing events to practice.

What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>As a subcontractor for Shouten International I led 4 full day workshops within their client's facilities in and around Paris. The workshop contents were provided by S&N and left some space for personal input, which was great ! The workshops were very oriented towards personal development with themes like ""Personal Impact"" and ""Say what you mean, mean what you say"" using different models in the S&N way but also creating a focus on experiential learning for these workshops. The groups averaged 10 people and the experiences were rated at an average of 4 out of 5. The rating of my facilitation was the highest note in all cases.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>I am a contracted facilitator for Shouten International involved in the global program that they developed for a corporate client. These facilitations have involved 4 delivery days + 1 preparation day covered, the daily fee being 750 Euros + expenses covered.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Having worked for 10 years for Timberland, an international organization where i held positions both in France and in the UK, i have a pretty extensive understanding of the corporate culture in this kind of industry, at a middle management level. My role as a customer service manager was beyond ensuring orders fulfillment and customers satisfaction as it also involved producing Sales forecasts on a weekly basis. This level of involvement in the managing team locally brought me to the expression of my leadership and assertiveness and also to the challenges of communication, politics and pressure that the results oriented strategies can deliver for sure. I was continuously interfacing with sales directors, European finance controllers, European Distribution Center, European headquarters, marketing, retail stores, franchises, key accounts, sales reps, and my 6 team members. This experience was very rich, fun, intense, diverse and i grew so much from it ! When i think about it today i see that i reached a point where I actually have really a lot of gratitude for it and i see that i was there standing in the fire already ! So, I consider that i have been there myself and can totally relate to the kind of challenges teams can face nowadays.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.

And that points me to something i know about my coaching already... even though there are no rules and i can be very Active, my major strengths as a coach reside in more of the Being part and i feel now like i could have challenged her more ... and that surely would have contributed to the timing.  Apart from that i notice that this coaching was mainly from the Fulfillment principle. I notice a good use of powerful questions, bringing values to life, mirroring, use of metaphors, naming emotions, witnessing, acknowledging, articulating what is going on, embodiment, intuition and following resonnance. It feels like the coaching was honoring the 4 Cornerstones also.   I feel like something shifted in the coaching from the moment she connected to a peak experience where she was honoring the values as in the Earth Charter. An option could have been to have her move into the expression of her Life Purpose from where she was with the word << Guide >>.  I feel like a piece of education around what it is to be truly whole could have been beneficial especially at the time she was crying. Also, what i feel i missed is actually what is missing for her in her life at the moment especially when she spoke about paris being a brain only place, and that would have been interesting to uncover i believe. To uncover what she feels disconnected from and see what comes out of there.  I believe i evoked transformation in this coaching on multiple occasions. There was also some challenging at the end around the time to start doing something with kids.  A good thing could have been to have her really embody who she is when she is the best that she can be and have her embody that so that she can reconnect to it. Ah yes, and challenge her more ! ;)  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
