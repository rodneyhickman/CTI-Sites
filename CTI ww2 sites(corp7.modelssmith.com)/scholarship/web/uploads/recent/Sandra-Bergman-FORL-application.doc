Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I would like to do what I know best and this is coaching and being with human beings, coaching in different languages. Being the "paid flying coach". I get inspired by people who are hungry for more. I see them as a mirror so I want to do more. I want to bring the possibility to change. Having kids myself, looking at the new leaders, the new generation, I want to help/support/ prepare the new world. So our kids can shine even more. We have chosen to bring them into this world where we are telling them to choose a fulfilling live, to speak the truth, not to fight, to love each other no matter what and not to take things personal.

Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The world is changing; people want to tell the truth, they want to feel alive. I want to bring more color, intensity, humor, energy, courage into this world. People are hungry for aliveness, for change. This would benefit everybody, the economy, the organizations, family, I feel connected to the people in the room, they are searching for something. Coming to a Cti course is being courageous. It is powerful to change. I want to contribute to the movement, to challenge them. They have a choice, a bit like the people in the Arab spring at this moment. And this is only one aspect...Being on type I give courage, challenge, I'm the 'spinach' in Popeye.

This client is very conscious of her life, there were moments you could hear more resonance than at other times. I started to be curious, started asking powerful questions like "What is important about the topic?" as this client is in her head most of the time. I was hearing the saboteur, and I chose not to go into it. I articulated what was going from level 1 where I could have blurted more of my intuition.  I chose to go into fulfillment - where she wants to be in 5 years time, values...etc  Cornerstones were present the whole time  From the Principle of balance, I clarified the topic  Process, I didn't use  I used most of the skills although I could have taken more charge of her saboteur talking and I chose to clear her head.  Powerful questions were used, although I could have made them shorter and more clear.  It took me some time to articulate what I was hearing. When I don't know, I could have asked. She too articulated the difference by being clearer and we co-created from there. A bit messy here as there was too much talking from me (level 1 in my head).  Acknowledgment was given a few times during the session, mostly at the end together with her values.  Championing was not being used, although when I said "you know what to do", I was championing her knowledge. She knows what she wants.  We closed the session with resonating the choices. I have requested her to do some homework and I hold her NCRW.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
