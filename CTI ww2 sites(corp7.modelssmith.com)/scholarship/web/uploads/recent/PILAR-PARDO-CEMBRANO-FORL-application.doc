I never coach her before. She asked me about coaching in the past and as she is an English teacher, for this I though this was a good opportunity to have a first session with her. Before the call we had an alliance to clarify her doubts and to ensure a safe space for her knowing I was going to record the call and to share it with you. It is a coaching session by phone.     I WANT TO CELEBRATE that this has been a good coaching session for Natalia, her energy and the space around her has changed along the call. She has contact with something important for her, she has been able to recognize a saboteur and although she wanted to get ride of it, at the end she realized this was part of her and the integration of it has been very key for her, to contact with the peace she was looking for. And I want to celebrate my courage to send this session for audition, far from being perfect, it is real and there is a lot about my as a coach in it: honor the cornerstones, creating a safe space, encourage client, witness, dance in the moment, creates the energy for transformation.     For me, there are two different parts on this coaching session first one is up to minute 16 more or less, focus on how to bring the new energy to the new house and the second where I invite her to connect with her inner wisdom (the captain) where I really focused on her and her transformation.     Co-Active Coaching Cornerstones has been present. People are naturally creative, resourceful, and whole, ex. Natalia find what to do with saboteurs in two different moments, she found her own resources. Focus on the whole person, although at the first part of the call I focused too much on something she told me before (moving a new house) after that this was a session for Natalia as a person. Dance in this moment, present all the time even when some of the things I said/proved didn't work. I meet Natalia were she was. I recognized that I started the call nervous due to the context (first call, in English, being recorded...) and thinking about doing it in a short time, but there was one moment, when the saboteur appeared for the first time that something changes inside me and I change the focus to serve Natalia despite time constrictions. Evoke transformation; the result of the coaching is a good example of it.     WHAT I DID WELL: use fulfillment principle, saboteur awareness, inner wisdom, resonance/dissonance between Natalia's words and her energy, articulates was going on, acknowledgment, powerful questions, be with and empower her... she did all the work with the saboteur by herself, move her from mind to feel it in her body.    WHAT I DID NO SO WELL: my self-management in the first part of the call, I was nervous, I went too fast, and I interrupt her. And I found myself talking a lot about the house with the intention to support her in creating the space and moment she was looking for without focus on her transformation. At the end of the session I didn't recognize that the arc was ended, I was hooked by the energy of the moment. I wanted to move her to action to soon with some close questions ex. Could you say this to yourself with tenderness? Vs. continue exploring and asking how would be... what would be the difference...   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
