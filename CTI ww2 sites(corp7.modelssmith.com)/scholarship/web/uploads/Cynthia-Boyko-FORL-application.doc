I AM type: : <b>Beauty</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>When I walked in to my first CTI Fundamentals course in January 2012, I felt like the foundation of my life shifted.  I knew I had come home.  I felt like I was in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.  Signy Wilson and Joni Mar were the co-leaders for the course and I was immediately drawn in.  I knew on every level that I wanted to devote my time and energy to leading courses as a Front of the Room Leader.  I didn't know how or when, or what that would look like, I just knew that it was where I wanted and needed to be.  When I completed leadership in February 2013, I declared to my tribe that I am stepping into becoming a CTI Front of the Room Leader.    I feel like I have a very unique set of experiences to offer as a CTI Front of the Room Leader.  Having taken the courageous leap of starting my own coaching business this year, after working in a large organization for over thirteen years, I know what it means to embrace fierce courage, passion, purpose and leadership.  I know that I am fresh and new in the CTI Co-Active community.  From day one of my first course, I felt so closely aligned with CTI and co-activity, that it felt like it had always been a part of me.  I am passionate about integrating, promoting, and inspiring others as part of this vibrant community.    I love the experience of Co-Activity, especially as a leader.  In many ways, I feel as though I am already a Front of the Room Leader for CTI.  It is meant to be and it feels as though it has already happened.  I am deeply committed to a successful and thriving career as a coach and as a Co-Active leader.  It would be an honour and a privilege to work as a Front of the Room Leader for CTI.  I am clearly holding this work as part of my vision and service in this world.    I feel like I was born to teach, lead, coach and help others.  I have known this on some level for much of my life.  Since CTI and Co-Active coaching and leadership have become part of my life in the last eighteen months or so, I feel like I am blossoming into the powerful expression of who I am as a Co-Active coach and leader.  I am excited and passionate about being a part of the CTI community as a Co-Active leader.    I am applying now to be a Front of the Room Leader because I felt so excited when I heard that CTI would be holding auditions.  I knew that I had to follow my excitement and express my interest and passion by applying for an audition.  I know that the possibilities are endless and I want to light the way for other CTI students.  Working as a Front of the Room Leader would be inspiring and I look forward to helping others become inspired, lit up, and connected to the possibilities in their own lives.    I love working with my coaching clients one-on-one, there is no question about that.  Yet, working with groups, especially in the context of CTI and Co-Activity is something that I thrive upon.    The Beauty I AM type and leadership energy that I have yearns for full expression in the context of co-leading, so that CTI students can discover the delicious possibilities in Co-Activity and at the same time, help them climb to new heights in their own passionate pursuits.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Imagine the world that could be created if the principles of Co-Activity were embraced by virtually everyone.  Co-Active families, Co-Active relationships, Co-Active businesses, Co-Active lives.  I want to be part of and in service of that vision.  CTI is about changing business and transforming lives.  This has motivated and inspired the growth of CTI and the expansion of Co-Activity is something that is vital and essential in this world.    Someone once described to me the impact of the Beauty I AM type as being a deep lake of cool water that invites people to dive in and make discoveries about their own strength, clarity and beauty.  I resonated with that image and feel as though it is the ripples of awareness that form when a stone is thrown into the lake.  The lake absorbs the stone and creates rings of growth, clarity, and expansion that ripple out into infinity.  This is the impact that I seek to have in the world as a Front of the Room Leader.  Co-Active coaching and leadership fundamentally changes what is possible.  CTI's training in Co-Activity, through leadership and coaching is the way in which I know I can best serve the world and help others to discover what impact they can have in this world.    I see the experiences that I bring to Co-Active coaching and leadership as creating expanding ripples that serve, grow, and inspire others in this world.  As CTI and Co-Activity grows in its impact in this world, we need Co-Active leaders who bring a range of background and experiences into the work that they do.  The impact that Co-Active coaching and leadership can have on people is essential in expanding what is possible in this world.  Peaceful, authentic, empowered relationships and businesses are the keys to creating a world that is more harmonious, and businesses that are more effective and full of integrity.  Let's continue to create that world together.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

She is currently launching a business as a consultant in mind body wellness.  I noticed that the recording sound quality made it harder to hear my voice compared to the client, likely because I was using a headset.  I do think this may have had some impact on how my presence/range appeared during the coaching demo.  Having said that, there is also an opportunity for me to expand my range as a coach and bring in higher energy into my voice and how I use it.  The rodeo metaphor had lots of life in it, and I liked the "Yee-haw" that I said and would love to see more of that.    I clarified what the topic was for the session.  I have a particular strength around giving a certain spaciousness to the client that really helps them to open up and reinforce trust in the coaching relationship.  I feel this was clearly present in this demonstration.  I noticed that curiosity, deep listening, self-management and dancing in THIS moment were all skills that were fully present.  I demonstrated a range of Co-Active coaching skills, including articulating what's going on, metaphor, powerful questions, and request/challenge.  Also, coaching clearly evoked transformation, as the client went from feeling confused and frustrated to owning that she is determined to do what it takes to give her planned course, and to stay in alignment with her values.    I was largely in the principle of Fulfillment during this coaching demonstration.  I explored bringing values to life, helping her to get connected with what is important to her: integrity (with self and others), and authenticity.  There was an opportunity to bring in her Captain and ask what her Captain would tell her about whether to jump ahead, or wait.  I asked powerful questions in support of this principle, such as, "Who is the YOU that you want to be?" and, "What would stretch you?"  I think the stretch was a good place to explore because it helped the client get connected to her determination.  She said clearly, "I am determined."  I responded with "You can do it!"  I feel like this moment of championing could have been expanded more and paired with an acknowledgement of her, such as, "Your passion and determination are inspiring."  Having her really feel her determination in her body might have been another way to help really land this.    Toward the end of the session, there was some Balance coaching brought in and I clearly named that she was in a perspective around her upcoming family travel.  I challenged her to get curious about and really embody the perspective of cow girl and her first rodeo.  With additional time in the coaching, I would have explored further what it would look like to stand in this perspective and what she could accomplish - what could she say yes to, and what would she say no to, in order to fulfill her vision of delivering her course in a way that felt like she was being authentic and in integrity with herself and others.  I would have also asked her to find something tangible to connect with and keep the rodeo cow girl image alive.  The end of the recording was cut short, and if I were doing it over again, I would have continued the recording and made sure the client was clearly on board with the homework and accountability piece.    Overall, I feel this demonstration showed good awareness, understanding and application of the Co-Active Model, with opportunities to improve or fine-tune in specific areas.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
