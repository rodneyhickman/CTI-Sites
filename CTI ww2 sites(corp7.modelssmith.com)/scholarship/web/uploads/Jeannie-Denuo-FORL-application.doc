Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I really believe in the Co-Active message. I am very rewarded by my coaching practice. Every time I help a client step back from the brink of burnout, or find their passion, or make a bold choice for their fulfillment, I feel alive. I have found what I was born to do, and now it is time for the next step in my evolution as coach.    A bit of my story:  I began my career working in marketing/advertising. Over the course of my 15 year career I achieved great success but also felt increasingly unhappy with each step I made up the corporate ladder. I longed for work that was more fulfilling.  I also knew I wanted to be married and have a family but my global job and travel was getting in my way.  When my management told me they had me on the succession plan to be CEO, I knew it was time to be honest with them and myself. I took myself out of the succession plan and began my coach training while still working. In 1999, I left my job and took a year off. In 2000, I began my coaching practice and met my husband.  I love my life, it really is a fairytale story.    What I miss most about my corporate job, and what I would look forward to as a FORL, is working with groups of people and the transformation that can come in community. I get energized watching lightbulbs go on. I enjoy the way learning is enhanced when it comes through experience.      Finally, and most important to me, I miss being a part of a greater community and look forward to having colleagues and cohorts with whom to share the journey, grow, challenge one another, and make a difference.    Henry Kimsey-House was the leader for my first CCC course. I walked out of that room knowing that I wanted to be a FORL one day and put the wheels in motion, completing Leadership and Certification in 2001.  Auditions have been held twice since then. The first were in 2005, the week before my daughter was due. The second were in 2007, the week after my son was due. I know that it was not meant to be at those times. Now the time is right. Maizie and Milo are 8 and 6. My life has taken a deep breath as they are beyond the difficult toddler years and in school full time. I have the presence of mind and the time (and appropriate sleep : ) to give myself to this next challenge.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>In an effort to keep me after I had resigned, my boss said "tell me what it is you want to do; I'll create a job around it!" I gave that a lot of thought. I loved the part of my job that had me mentoring others through their careers and counseling those that came in for support. I could see myself in a position like that, but frankly, I was too far gone. The burnout of 15 years had settled in my bones and I needed a break.     What I realized as time went on was that I might never have had to leave my job if I'd had some coactive training earlier in my career and worked for a company that valued and prioritized people in that way.    Through my experience and my clients, I see the incredible impact of the Co-Active way of being in the world. I see the impact on my kids and my parenting. I feel like I was put here to be a part of the movement to spread this message. I've made my money, this step isn't about the money for me. It is about giving back to my community and helping to make this world a better place for my kids to navigate as they get older.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe. You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>It is impossible to know for sure what level of travel to commit to without having an experience of it. This feels reasonable to me:  US: 12x/year, International: 2x/year</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <br /><b>1x per month no problem. Occasionally two, but more than 2x per month feels like too much.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <br /><b>Yes. Same frequency as above. As a mom to a 6 and 8 year old, it is important for me to tell you our home situation.  When we got married, my husband and I made a decision to be very active co-parents. We had both enjoyed great career success. We were older when we got married and started our family and didn't want our lives to be ruled by a big mortgage or responsibility to many employees. I had recently left my corporate position and my husband sold his company just as our daughter came into the world. We moved our family from Chicago to Chapel Hill, NC, bought a smaller house in a quiet neighborhood. My husband now does contract work and sets his own hours, often working from home. Right now, he works his schedule to be home with the kids every day from 3pm on and doesn't work Fridays--his day as Mr. Mom. I have maintained my coaching practice each year since 2000. Now, with our kids 6 and 8 years old and in school full time, David is fully supportive of me stepping in to this next phase of my work.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <br /><b>Yes. I have spent extensive time in Asia (lived in Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong), Europe, and Mexico through my work corporately. Though I do not speak any languages fluently, I do feel very comfortable conducting myself with respect to local customs/cultures.  I grew up speaking German and learned some Mandarin while living in Taiwan.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>2013 (7), 2012 (9)  Second half of 2012 and first half of 2013 are a bit of an aberration as I spent the year as President of my children's school PTA which cut in to my business.

How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <b>5</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$1,200</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <b>40%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2000</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Mid and Upper management executives who have achieved great success by conventional standards but find their lives lacking a feeling of fulfillment. They tend to be women, 35-50. About half of them are moms with children at home.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>95% of my clients are corporate professionals at the VP or SVP level. My contracts are directly with my clients, not through corporations. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have occasionally had clients request I work with them and another individual on a work or team relationship in my private coaching practice. Also, I do work with intact and newly forming teams in my role as facilitator at Triangle Training Center http://triangletraininginc.com/  and Competitive Edge, Inc. http://www.cedgeinc.com/index.html </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>Coach and Grow RICH program of practice development. Group Coaching Essentials course through Potentials Realized, Jennifer Britton. Pathways to Successful Living seminars. this was not coach-specific training, rather 100% personal growth oriented. Completed Basic, Advanced and Leadership courses. This is an Illinois based company, similar to Landmark Education.

What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>Communication skills workshop for department managers at a large local retirement community and nursing home.    Greater than 20 leadership development and team building programs, details below.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Contracted leader/facilitator for two North Carolina-based training companies:  Triangle Training http://triangletraininginc.com/   Competitive Edge, Inc http://www.cedgeinc.com/index.html     These two companies specialize in experiential training and development and I work with them on in-classroom and outdoor high and low challenge course programs as a facilitator. The groups I work with range in size from 6-20 participants.  While programs are developed by the leaders of these organizations, my collaboration is often sought in program design and I am given the freedom to add or change program elements on the fly as I see fit to maximize the learning of my group. Programs range from half to full day with some multi-day programs.    Clients include UNC, Duke University, Wake Forest University, professional associations, local business leaders, and others.    I work as a contract employee on an as-needed basis. I am able to accept or turn down work freely.  I do this work to get my "fix" of working with groups and love it!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>15 years corporate experience. My position at the time of my leaving was SVP, Director of International Media Services. A large part of my role was working with our companies around the world to hire and develop the best talent possible to serve our clients.      I regularly gave presentations to groups: the Board, clients, staff. I started my career on the McDonald's business where I presented to groups of 1500 owner-operators.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I love group work. I really enjoy encouraging collaboration and helping groups to find the win-win. I know the downside to focusing on nothing but the bottom line and believe that even greater success is possible when other things are valued.    I believe I have a knack for having all voices be heard and valued.    I believe that my work internationally gave me a unique perspective to draw on. As humans, we are assumption-making machines. I learned to check my assumptions at the door each time I entered a new country and worked with their people. It created a curiosity in me that has served me well in my coaching and leading.    I believe I have found a way to walk the fine line between corporate voice and coach. My clients often tell me that what gives me credibility with them is that I "get" the world that they are living in.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

While the initial question was one of "level of satisfaction", this was largely a session that fell in the Balance realm, helping Marie get clear and act from that place of clarity. Good examples of Co-Active coaching: lots of clarifying. Marie had a notion of what she "should" do, but had not teased out the particulars or looked at what is/isn't working. Good reframe and shift of perspective: spending time in the present is the best way to take care of the future. Good self-management: this is an industry I worked in and it is easy to make assumptions and project my thinking on things. Felt I did a good job of listening to Marie's truth.    I missed an opportunity to delve into what makes her job satisfaction a 7/8 and gather some Values to contribute to the rest of the conversation. Also, there was a point where I asked "what can you do day to day?" that I heard defeat in Marie's voice as she answered. I could have called that out to see what it is about, breathe a bit before moving to what to "do."  I rolled right through that one.    After the recording ended and Marie and I finished talking, I asked her greatest take-aways from our call. She stated that simply taking the time to reflect on what is already working helped her to feel better about what she is doing.  This is a client with a big job, and a big heart. I was able to acknowledge that as we ended our call.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
