Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I believe the experience of being a Front of Room Leader for CTI would be an incredible growth opportunity, both personally and professionally. The Co-Active work has been life-changing for me and I would love to be a part of that for others. I am a natural leader and teacher, so the opportunity to train people on the skills I most love would be thrilling, live-giving, affirming, and a whole lot of fun! I also imagine there is a deepening that happens when leading others in the Co-Active Way. I imagine it really getting into my bones at an even more profound level, making me a better coach, leader, wife, step-mother, friend, family member, solopreneur, and human being. Additionally, I think it would be a great opportunity for me to utilize and further develop my language skills, and possibly travel internationally, something I have always enjoyed and felt "at home" with. To connect with people across the globe and have an impact on a wider world by bringing them the Co-Active Way would be an honor.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The Co-Active Way is clearly being called for in our world. People are hungry for it, even if they don't know it yet. When we can live in a world where there is "no one right way", we are freed up to appreciate one another for exactly who we each are, AND still get the job done.    I see Co-Active living as one way to raise consciousness and connection on an individual level, bringing the world incrementally into higher levels of functioning. I want for the world to be more harmonious. I want for all people to live authentic, self-honoring lives. I want for relationships to be deeply mindful, respectful and connected. I believe the Co-Active Way leads to this.  I have always felt that the Co-Active skills can be applied in all facets of life and for people of all ages and cultures, professions and roles. It teaches people more effective ways to use the brain and body in relationships. In the organizational work that I do, what I've found is that a lot of people actually like what they do, and that the majority of their stress comes from their relationships and the work load they carry. I see a need for both Co-Active skills and Relationship Agility to help people live more effectively, with greater joy and less stress, becoming more outwardly productive, and creating a healthier life from the inside out.  The drama and trauma that we see on the news and in our communities and even our homes is, very simply put, a cry to be seen, to be heard, and to feel understood. The Co-Active Way is all about seeing and hearing and seeking to understand. If we can have more of this worldwide, the generations that follow will have a greater chance of experiencing a healing planet. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I have worked within several organizations, including Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners, and Hennepin County Government Center. At Mayo Clinic and HealthPartners, as an employee who did external counseling/coaching, I experienced the oppressive nature of certain organizational ways of "managing" people. I observed individuals come in with exuberance and excitement about their work, and then the gradual demise to complacency and dissatisfaction, mostly due to the environment, relationships and ineffective demands. This has created a desire in me to offer alternative perspectives and ways of woking together.    At Hennepin County, I have been coaching internally with their employees for nearly 4 years, and the scope of practice and groups has been broad. I have worked with many different departments, who each bring a variety of personality types and mindsets, strengths and limitations, biases and skepticisms. In the position I hold as "wellness coach", I find it common that people impassively expect that I will bring the standard information and lectures about diets and stress management. Given my Co-Active training, among other things, I consistently "surprise" them with the kind of engagement I design into workshops and the new approaches I offer in presentations. I am frequently invited back to departments and teams because they want more of what I bring. Because I also coach on an individual level, I am able to tie the learnings in groups back to how it applies in the workplace and according to particular roles.   Although my official title is ""wellness coach"" I have found that as I have grown and evolved, I have attracted a different type of client, many through internal referral. I am now coaching many department directors, assistant directors and leaders within county administration, doing what would probably be considered ""leadership coaching"" although we place it under the category of ""stress reduction"", due to the framework of my official role.    Given my training in Neuroscience, Consciousness and Transformational Coaching with BEabove Leadership, I am able to speak to what's happening in the brain when using different coaching processes and skills. I find that people who tend to be more "left-brained, linear thinkers" connect more easily to the work when there is science behind it. I've noticed this particularly when working with IT groups, accountants, attorneys and other "just the facts, Ma'am" folks. In my previous work with addictions, I gained a lot of experience in Motivational Interviewing and my ears are trained to listen for "change talk" and I am able to "roll with resistance", which I find valuable when working with groups. As I complete any presentation or workshop, I am intentional about making the learning real by requesting they commit to something tangible, an action step that they can bring forward and practice immediately as they return to their daily tasks and routines.    Another thing I've grasped in my work within organizations is that you truly can't please all of the people all of the time. I have actively practiced not taking things personally. People are coming from wherever they are coming from. I am able to self-manage, acknowledge them, make them right, and create from whatever they are bringing into the conversation. I am able to recover when being "hooked" and simply see what's needed and what emerges.    I have a very playful leadership style and I consciously practice engaging and connecting with each individual at the very beginning of any group work, as much as possible (depending on group size). I use a lot of humor and still bring a level of intensity that calls people forth. I love teaching, presenting, leading. It is FUN. It feels natural. And I've found that my warmth, charm and charisma welcomes people into the experience, lessening any resistance they may have shown up with. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>As a Soultype 2, I am able to connect with a wide range of people, despite age, gender, nationality, cultural background, personality type, etc. I have a strong presence in the room and am able to shift the energy and "change color" based on the impact I want to have. I dance with the moment and am able to create from whatever is showing up. I am able to word things in a variety of ways to connect based on the particular audience, along with showing up authentically, which I think transcends many "barriers" to connection.    Having lived and studied in Europe for most of my college years, I am gifted and practiced at connecting with people from other cultures. I speak fluent Spanish, I have a proficient level of Parisian French, and I would estimate that I speak an intermediate level of Dutch. I feel confident that I could coach and train in Spanish immediately. With some "brushing up" and vocabulary expansion, I could also train in French. Dutch may take me some more time, and I'm sure that given the opportunity (exposure and practice) I could become fluent enough to coach and train in Dutch as well. I believe that at this time, I could readily observe coaching practice in French and Dutch and give feedback in English. In the past, I spoke a beginner level of Moroccan Arabic, some of which I have retained; I currently speak enough to establish rapport and make a positive connection with people of Arabic background. Needless to say, I have a great ability to connect human-to-human worldwide. I enjoy speaking other languages and learning about cultures and belief systems different that my own. I have traveled to every continent, except Antarctica, and I find people all over the planet to be fundamentally good, kind, and eager to connect with depth and meaning.    Finally, as CTI's Ambassador to the Twin Cities, I have had the opportunity to both present individually and co-lead on the Co-Active Model in a variety of settings. I find co-leading highly effective and enjoyable. I love being able to lean in to my co-leader and discover new ways of expressing things, that I would not have thought of with my brain alone. My experience in this role has helped me formulate words for describing what Co-Active is and communicate to others what it is about, how it works and the value it offers. I am passionate about the Co-Active Way and would be thrilled to lead this work at a greater level in my community and the world at large.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

All the Cornerstones (Evoke Transformation, Client is Naturally Creative Resourceful and Whole, Dance in This Moment, and Working with the Whole Person) and Contexts (Listening, Curiosity, Intuition, Self-Management, Deepening and Forwarding) were actively in play. The Co-Active skills I used included : Articulating what's going on, Clarifying, Holding the focus, Safe and Courageous Space, Metaphor, Powerful Questions, Reframing, Taking Charge and Intruding, Structures, and Requesting.     What I did well was really holding the space for the client, deepening and forwarding, listening at Levels 2 and 3, and using my intuition. I could've gone to goal setting, planning and brainstorming, but it seemed too quick, and not what she needed. I self-managed and named this urge, and then took her to the part of her that is "buried under hats" in her roles. Using the principle of Process, I had the client take me deeper and deeper into what was happening for her. I also pulled in some aspects of Balance with the use of geography and having her get into her body.     Some missed opportunities were in the different ways I could've explored some of her comments, like by asking, "What's it like to be a hat lady?" or "What else is on top of the mountain? Who are you there?" I could've gone more into the clarity she was discovering to see what else was available there, although going to the "heart emotion" was also useful. I could've done more Championing, Acknowledging, and/or used Meta-view. Also, I did not tie what's happening for her to her Values or what her Vision for herself would be if she had the balance she is wanting. There were a couple questions that were not necessarily powerful, like "where does joyous presence come from in other areas of life?"     Overall, I think this was a highly effective coaching session and the client clearly shifted in the time we had as a result of my being Co-Active with her.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
