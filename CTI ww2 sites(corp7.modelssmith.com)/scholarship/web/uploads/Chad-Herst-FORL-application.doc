I AM type: : <b>Sex-Intelligence</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I have received so much from CTI's Co-Active Leadership and Co-Active Coach training that I feel compelled to give it back.  In the most pragmatic of senses, CTI's work has given me a new career.  Since 2010, my primary work has been that of a coach.  Most importantly, the Co-Active models I learned from CTI have given me a format to weave together the various passions I've been cultivating throughout my life--East-West philosophy and embodied healing--into one central model and way of working with people.  The model is flexible enough to allow all of my passions to fit without being so flexible that my work is without structure.  In short, I believe in the power of Co-Activity, and I want to share it with a wider audience.  Likewise, the work of teaching and leading is absolutely fulfilling to me.  I've been running yoga classes and schools for the last 18 years, and in the last six years, I've been co-leading yoga teacher trainings and leadership trainings.  Working with groups excites me and connects me to my life's purpose, ""connecting others to their soul's journey.""  Finally, I recognize that as we move into a time of great technological leaps that have us evermore interconnected, locally and internationally, that I want to have a greater impact.  I cannot think of a better way to do that by supporting and being part of an organization that imparts emotionally intelligent skills that put relationships first.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Living in San Francisco and working with people who are either at the helm, in the trenches, or are funding the varieties of social networks that are connecting us globally, I cannot help but see that emotional intelligence is sorely needed.  While the technological breakthroughs they are creating are astounding, the inter-relational skills that the Co-Active model promotes could help not only within the organizations but also have profound global impact. It is not about sacrificing the technology for emotional intelligence or emotional intelligence for technology but about intertwining them together and, as a result, creating a co-created third option. By working as a FORL, I believe I will have greater impact than I currently have in supporting of formation of this third option. That way, we as the human race can honor our diversity and nurture greater acceptance and understanding on a global level.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <b>None.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I currently co-run monthly workshops with my wife, Melissa, and leadership tribe mate, Abraham Alonzo, on emotional intelligence topics, like conscious communication, noticing the inner critic, and mindfulness.  We also led a personal development training in 2011-2 that spanned six months and included five weekend workshops on various topics, ongoing coaching, and group projects, heavily influenced by our CTI Leadership experience.    From 2006 to March 2013, I co-founded and co-ran a Yoga School, called Mission Ashtanga.  In the last two years, we ran daily yoga classes, and a teacher training biannually, along with two retreats in the Santa Cruz Mountains.     And while I've recently stepped down from my position at Mission Ashtanga, I am working with a dedicated group of 10 students from Mission Ashtanga, exploring the historical and philosophical foundations of Yoga in an effort to make them applicable to modern life.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>While my graduate studies have brought me into the field of health and wellness, I keep being drawn back into the world of corporations.  I worked as a marketing manager for a mid-sized lighting corporation for two years.  This was my father's business and had previously been my grandfather's and great grandfather's and was to be mine.  So I grew up working at and hearing about corporate affairs.  After about six months of working at Peerless after graduating college in 1997, I realized that I wanted out, but I committed to my father that I would stay until the company sold.  I was on a team of executives and investment bankers forging a story that would make the company appear attractive to a suitor.  While I was a newbie in the corporate world, this experience gave me an insiders view into how deals get done.      Subsequently, I trained as an acupuncturist and had been in the health and wellness industry until I became a coach.  Given the fact that I live in San Francisco, many of my clients work in corporate jobs and start-ups.  I'm, generally speaking, not hired as a ""corporate coach.""  I tend to be hired as a ""life coach,"" helping my clients transition in their careers or personal lives.  I've worked with C-level individuals in organizations like Twitter, Facebook, Citibank, Ubisoft, and Roache. This work has given me a view into corporations.  I've also been supporting a client who, for the last two years has been bringing mindfulness trainings through Google's Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute to SAP.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I don't believe anything is missing from what I've described above.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

The client has just about completed the recording of a rock album he and his band mate have collaborated on.  He reports both an excitement about the sound they have created along with a sort of fatigue.  I meet the client in the Principle of Fulfillment to build resonance.  While I do take the client into resonant tones, overall, though, the coaching falls short of its mark because I'm not crystal clear on the client's agenda.  That being said, I do build resonance by connecting him to his values, especially the ones that will carry him through the completion of the album and its promotion.  But by missing the client's agenda, I'm not holding him completely NCRW and, as a result, the resonance I attempt to build is met with a kind of flatness on the part of the client.  While this may not be my best coaching ever, I do employ: Levels 2 & 3 Listening, Intuition, Curiosity, Forward the Action &  Deepen the Learning, Big "A" Agenda, Resonance/Dissonance, Values, Be With, Take Them Where They Are, Safe & Courageous Space, Powerful Questions, AWGO, Acknowledgement, Geography, Taking Charge, Metaphor, and Integration.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
