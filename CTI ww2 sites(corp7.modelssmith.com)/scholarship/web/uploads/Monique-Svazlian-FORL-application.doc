Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love CTI and Co-Activity! I love the community of CTI and everything CTI stands for. I wanted to become a FORL from the very beginning and have done my best to prepare myself to be ready to become a FORL the past 4 years since obtaining my CPCC. I've assisted in many CTI Core Curriculum classes in San Rafael and New York, was an active part of the CTI Community in England when I lived in Europe, and was in talks with CTI to bring Co-Activity to Italy when I lived there. I've designed and co-led many workshops and trainings using Co-Active leadership skills and everything I do (coaching and training) with clients is infused with CTI's models and frameworks.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I believe that Co-Activity is integral and fundamental in how we relate to one another as human beings. The models and frameworks that CTI offers help us learn these important communication skills in an experiential way that helps us really embody them. They are great skills for coaches, but more importantly they are useful to anybody when it comes to relating in a way that is more empathic, compassionate and constructive. If we are to face the big challenges of our time, all of us need these communication skills to thrive and co-create the solutions to these challenges. I am dedicating my work to this and becoming a FORL would help me spread this work farther and wider. It's very much aligned with my personal/professional Big A agenda and my purpose of why I am here at this moment in history.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

I've designed and led workshops and trainings for Deloitte and other companies. I'm very comfortable in a corporate setting and my experience and background working with companies in Silicon Valley and internationally make me well-suited to lead CTI courses within organizations.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I'm passionate about culture change and believe Co-Activity is very applicable and essential to helping bring about shifts in culture.

What was Effective:   -Coach asks the client to clarify the topic for the call - clients wants to change his relationship with money  -Coach picks Balance Coaching to explore different perspectives to help the client shift out of his current relationship to money.  -Clarify Current Perspective of client - Coach asks client to articulate the current belief as it relates to money - 'money is the root of all evil'  -Coach does a good job in having the client to embody the current perspective - what are the feelings or sensations that come up in your body? What's possible from this place?  -Coach asks powerful questions and helps client get clear on the geography of this perspective.  -Coach asks the client to stand up and turn to another direction and asks to identify an item to help shift his perspective. Good use of geography.  -Client mirrors and helps the coaching go deeper in each new perspective  -Good use of metaphor and mirroring of metaphor by coach  -Coach does a good job at helping the client embody several other perspectives and helps them go deeper in them and name a number of new perspectives, and asks him to choose a new, more resonant perspective.    What I could have done better:  -I could have acknowledged the client throughout the coaching  -Said "Great" too many times! I was self-conscious!  -Once we were done exploring all the perspectives and the client chose the new perspective, as the coach I could have created more resonance for the client in the new perspective before leading him into the brainstorm.  -Once the saboteur came into the coaching, could have asked the client to invite the saboteur to step away to help the client come back into the more resonant perspective     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
