(Nick Kettles is the author of the quote.)  I also believe that we are the leaders of our lives<br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Publications? Articles? White papers?

Another executive went with me into deep process coaching and opened the black box she had never dared look at or share.  This enabled her to understand and overcome limiting beliefs and behaviors that were seriously crippling her managing and her career.  <br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Work visa (which countries): </b>European Union, Switzerland, USA<br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Travel visa (which countries): </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Media exposure (tv, radio, on-camera training videos, etc.): </b>Not yet<br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Size of group comfortable presenting to: (under 30, 31-75, 76-150, 151-300, 300plus): </b>Range: 1-30<br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Endorsements (from senior-level coachees, from speaking engagements, from corporate clients re their ability as a corporate FORL): </b><br />Andrea displayed exceptional insight wisdom and sensitivity in delivery a Leadership Development course for my company. Her skill and knowledge made the course very productive for all who participated, and a series of one-to-one follow up sessions with her enabled me to gain very valuable insights into my personal and professional life and behaviour, and lay the foundation for further personal development.  Andrea is particularly good at helping you explore new ideas. She gives you the courage to pursue exciting paths rather than conventional ones.  <br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Provide a half page written critique: </b><br />The client set the agenda and we explored the vision of what she wants.  Dancing in the moment,  I consistently picked up on what she said and helped her articulate even more.  I was coaching fulfillment, and encouraged her to feel what she was describing, to explore what is possible and help her see who she is and what are her gifts.  I used powerful questions, intuition, geography, deep listening, curiosity, values work.  It took charge and created a safe and courageous space, and gave her lots of space.    I acknowledged her, and could have done more.  There are places I could have taken her even deeper into the feeling and experience to get to a really resonant place. I did not use the potential metaphors of the disruption of the construction noise or the bings from an Iphone, which I could have done.  I didnt celebrate her as much as I could have.  Speaking of being heard was perhaps more consulting.  <br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Where the person would best be utilized? 1.
