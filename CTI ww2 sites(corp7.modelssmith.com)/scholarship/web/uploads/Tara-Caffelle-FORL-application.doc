Level 1 response: : <br /><b>From the first moment I sat in a CTI classroom, this is what I have wanted to do. I am a natural teacher and I think also a gifted leader.  So there's those reasons.  I am also bouncing in my office chair with excitement at the very prospect of getting to do this work and to play in the same arena as those who I have learned from and admired since I began this journey.      PS I secretly also love the power of dinging the little CTI chime.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>This work, this Co-Activity, is important.  It's what is going to change the direction of this planet and the people on it.  I believe in rich, full communication that is about so much more than the weather.  I believe in acting as a midwife as those around me find their highest selves and their way to Being On Purpose.  I consider this work to be the highest of callings, and I believe this role is an invitation for me to step into this bigger game to have my impact.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe. You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>Once per month, but not necessarily every month, please.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <b>One course per month </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <br /><b>Yes, this would also be one to two times per month </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <b>Yes!  Would love it!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <b>10-12</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <b>10</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <b>$2500</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <b>90%</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2008</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>Women's Body Image Issues/Individuals in Relationship </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>None currently but I do expect that to change in the next 6-8 months </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I coach a lot of couples as they navigate transitional periods in their relationships (I also do some work as a birth doula) and in the past have supported teams I have worked within, from within,</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <b>None</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>I have created and led 2 workshops with colleagues from my Leadership Tribe; one on Body Image which has been delivered 3 times and will be offered twice more in the fall, and one on Work/Life Balance (and what a myth that whole idea really is) to the governing body of accountants here in Canada for which they received professional development credits.  I am in the process of developing a larger program with a Leadership colleague from another tribe who is also based in Vancouver.      I have brought together small groups for informal workshops to create vision boards and things like that.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <b>No I am not.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My 'portfolio' career spans several industries: health and wellness, tourism, communications, finance etc. and in each of these, I waggled co-activity in wherever I could by leading small workshops and team-building events, but that is the extent of it.      I am currently learning the LEAN principles so that I may do some work with an efficiency consultant I have become aligned with recently and this is tremendously interesting to me.      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I think my lack of experience in this area is not related to my level of skill at all, and rather a desire to progress at a pace in my career that resonated for me.  I firmly believe that slow and steady wins the race, so I allow this philosophy to guide my work - this is not to say that I am not ambitious (I am actually quite ridiculously driven and am what my coach calls a 'high producing human'.) It means that I know that big things are ahead, and I know I will be ready for them when they present themselves.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Are you currently an ICF member? - Yes/No : <b>Yes</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. What ICF credentials do you currently hold? (ACC, PCC, MCC, or None): <br /><b>None currently, but I am eligible for ACC and am literally amassing the paperwork in order to submit.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	If you do not currently have an ICF credential: : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>a.	Which credential are you pursuing? : <br /><b>It feels like ACC is a foregone conclusion, so I am happily going after PCC (300+ hours so far) </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>b.	Have you applied for the credential? Yes/No : <b>No</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>c.

However, we do want more language diversity in our leader body and seek those who are multilingual.  We are looking for leaders who are fluent in Canadian French, Parisian French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	In addition to English, what languages do you speak? : <br /><b>I speak halting Parisian French, accented with a lot of hand gestures to get my point across.  My partner speaks perfect Parisian French, so I do expect my skills to improve.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Which of these is your native tongue? : <b>English</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Which of these do you speak fluently? : <b>English </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Which do you use when coaching? : <b>English </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	Which do you use when conducting business? : <b>English </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section I: Provide a half page written critique of your recorded Co-Active Coaching Demo. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Critique : <br /><b>*This is a former client that I completed work with more than 2 years ago.  She is not a co-active coach, but has had some coach training through a different institution.    ***  I feel like I provided a safe and judgment-free space for her.  I allowed her to share perhaps too much background information, but by the end of the call, I see that it also served to provide us with a bed of context with which to work.  I feel like I championed her well, and acknowledged who she was being, although I think I would have liked to have done that more.  I think I floundered in the dance a little; was perhaps thrown off by beeps in the recording and the very fact that I was recording.      I think I did a good job of forwarding the action and calling her forth to her stake/desired impact in her situation.  I asked several powerful questions, but I do wish I had dove further at several places to probe more at what she was saying - a few times that jump out for this are when she said she was craving to contribute and also when she was talking about her views on cancer.      Overall, I think I celebrated her life and her progress and where she is looking to go, but I also feel like I could have made it richer for her.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
