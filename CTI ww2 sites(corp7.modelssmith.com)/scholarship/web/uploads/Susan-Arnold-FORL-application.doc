As a FORL, at times, this will certainly be present in the room.   Roni is a brilliant, gifted PHD, in her late 60's,  who is facing continuous shrinkage in contract work with her college employer.  She wants to augment this work by creating her own tutoring business. We have reconvened to lock into her values and discover what is resonant and thrilling for her as she moves forward in her career.  She is also deciding on her future residence.  She has asked for business start up coaching as well.    Many strong coaching techniques are present in this session.  Clearing, powerful questions, acknowledgement, championing and creating a safe and courageous space are among them.  It was loving and fierce.  Listening levels 2 and 3 are employed, intuition, curiosity and self management are present.  I continued to build on previously developed learning and action.  Though the session feels light and full of life, she really wanted to stay small.  It was a challenge to keep her moving forward in the direction of her greatness.  Keeping the meta view, seeing her whole life was paramount for her - holding her as NCRW.  Taking charge was also necessary at times.  The use of metaphor (net game) worked for her and she became excited about her gifts, strengths and abilities. Ultimately, she experienced a strong sense of empowerment.  She saw and claimed her amazing abilities and power.  There is integration of the 3 coaching principles with the primary use of fulfillment.      In the course of taking charge, at times, my coaching became directive and consultative which shut her down and invited her to lean on me.  I would love to have used more finesse with this.  Brainstorming rather than leading.  Mentoring was present without differentiating the two.  More succinct, powerful questions would have helped her connect the dots herself rather than having them articulated for her.  I could have opened up the space rather than labeled it for her.  I played hard ball at one point and came close to the outer edge of calling forth her magnificence.  (Later in the session, I softened my approach and let her lean into what she had discovered).  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
