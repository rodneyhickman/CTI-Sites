I hold her naturally creative, resourceful & whole   I hold the client`s agenda and I address the coaching to the whole person, by letting here discover the reactions in her body (embodiment) in the range of emotions that occur when she talks about the topic.  The use of Principles, Process coaching; discover how the situation reflects in the body. Balance coaching; new perspective how is not to take the responsibility for her ex-husband behavior.    Bringing Values to life, check in with the values, fulfillment coaching for her to embody the strength and use it in the future. I make her forward the action and deepen the learning, awareness of the "alarm clock" and how it can support here in the future. Look at the pattern that she wants to change and recognize when she can stop up and take a resonant choice based on her strength and gut feeling (values). Work with her life purpose, who is she as a mother for her daughter. I was championing her for her wish for the relationship between her daughter and father.   I`m curios and ask powerful questions; solutions for whom? Metaphor, you feel like a zombie, I used my intuition to bring that metaphor forward. I witness her; you feel angry and sadness!      I could be much more curious about the strength in her body, where do you feel that. For her to discover and explore the feelings that she has more deeply. Witness instead of asking if this is the feelings she has. That would have given the coaching more dance in this moment flow.    The Coaching did not evoke big transformation, more deepen the learning and forward the action.  In this sample I did not put out a request or a challenge.  Acknowledgment; I could have acknowledge her for her braveness to stand in the storm and be there for her daughter.       </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
