Level 1 response: : <br /><b>We - Schouten Global and CTI -  need German speaking leaders who are also residents in Germany in order to strengthen the German market. I work with the Co-Active coaching product for almost 5 years and I know a lot about the market, the expectations and needs of the clients in this country. I have experimented with different ways and approaches of how I talk about this product, I have insight into other coaching products and clearly address how Co-Active differs and where it is unique. I have developed a strong point of view of how it is valuable for clients who are searching for the right training for themselves. I have spoken and collaborated with many CTI leaders, co-led information session in person and virtually. I believe that through my qualification of becoming a leader I can support and grow the business with even more depth and impact as I can bring in this valuable knowledge and firm standing behind the product.  Being a leader would also enrich my job life enormously adding more diversity in my job life which would be very enriching for me personally. I am seeking for ways of working directly with people instead of solely doing office work all day long. This is why I chose the Certification program to become a professional coach. Being a leader is for me another step into the direction to have more collaboration and impact by working with people directly, face to face. In fact it feels like a consequent next step for me.  I am aware that I do not meet the requested qualifications. Last week I have submitted my written exam finalizing the CTI Certification program and my oral exam is planned for Sept. 11. I haven`t done Leadership and I am only in the beginning of building my coaching practice. Yet, I believe that I can develop myself within the next 1,5 years to really grow myself so I feel ready to co-lead. And I am aware that even then the journey and the development is an ongoing personal and professional process. I love to learn, grow and stretch myself beyond my comfort zone. I am deeply committed and focused to achieve more experience and skills and I am aware of the high responsibility towards the clients who come to the courses.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Teaching, leading and Collaborating are some of my core values and I want to serve the world as much as I can through living up to my values. Since I can see the impact of Co-Active Coaching by connecting with participants on all course levels for many years, I understand, how the training frees people from limitations and opens them up to their true being. It is a mission and vision for me to support this work as much as I can. Although I might not be ready yet to co-lead a group, I feel called forth to do so. Being a CTI leader is one way to actively live and shape the transformation that needs and wants to happen in the world and to which I feel the urge to contribute to.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

She impressed me with her topic as she showed up very self reflected. I chose a FUL question in the beginning, "How does it feel when you are complete?", to give her a solid reference for what she was looking for. In the beginning of the coaching she did a lot of talking, asking her to bottom line could have been helpful to move deeper immediately.   I then chose Process, as she was very aware about what was fulfilling about her goal. What happens in the moment while you talk in your body? This question called the saboteur (the feeling is only in the moment and it should last longer) and I decided to bypass it by going into embodiment and strengthen even more her  awareness of how she connects with her inner self. As this called in the saboteur again, I opened up the space for the what is making it hard and I saw that she is very much in her head. Still it felt, that she made connection with this energy and I moved on with embodiment and again bypassed the heady concerns. After re viewing the coaching I feel, I should have addressed this more directly by either sharing that I see her disconnect in the moment she goes to her head or by sharing some context around exercising new behaviors.   I then worked as a mirror, going with her and also embodying everything she mentioned and throwing in my intuition what I noticed, to see what this opened up for her.   I intruded when she was exactly where she connected without being fully aware. This was a great moment, but asking her to describe her inner self with a metaphor caused that she went back into her head and resonance shortly dropped, but then she came up with the colors and energies. I kept sticking with the embodiment and Process questions to really increase her awareness that everything she was looking for is already there. Finally she came to speak about her feelings that do not come out but urgently want to be expressed. This is where the coaching really wanted to go and where it is valuable to continue working. As time was short I made this an inquiry for her. She found the matching body posture, a yoga posture, to explore more around connecting with her inner self.   I wish I had finished the coaching by asking her to summarize her learning and think of what else she would need to round off the coaching. After reviewing the coaching I can also feel that I had created an energy in this coaching that I was almost too much taking charge. Maybe this is because I did this coaching extra for the auditions. All in all I believe that I have held the cornerstones, chose an adequate principle, and had powerful questions to deepen her learning. I could have improved it, by making a request or challenge in the end, but she did also get an action out of it.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
