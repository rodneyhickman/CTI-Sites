Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I want to feel ALIVE!  I want to make full use of my passion to coach.

I want to be part of a team of vibrant evolutionary loving thought leaders and actors that inspires thousands of others to join in the conscious dance of creating the lives and world we all LOVE to live in!  I want to feel challenged to lean way out - or way in - to my own fullest self-expression in the world.  I want to hone my own coaching skills and in so doing, position myself as a master coach or expert in the field of growing consciousness in the world at large.

There is evidence of the four cornerstones being honoured throughout.  The transformation being evoked is subtle, but evident as 'B' grows conscious of a new way of viewing her moving forward.   The coaching begins with a few powerful questions asking B for the focus of the coaching as well as about its importance to her & what her legacy might be.  There is an implied Designed Alliance, evidenced by B's trust as she leans into the coaching & shares honestly her challenge.  Curiosity, listening and intuition show up a number of times through the questions and in some of the articulating of what I hear to be going on, as in when I reflect back my sense in B's use of the word 'should', and the exploration of how B feels about being visible.  Resonance is found in values identification & explored around visibility as well as following her heart as she goes forward.  A few fun & resonant metaphors come up in the 'sandwich' and figure skating images, and geography/ embodiment is used to deepen the connection & experience of this perspective.  I acknowledge B a couple of times re: expressing her love for the earth, her deep integrity.    The Learning is Deepened when B is asked to reflect back on the focus & articulate what she is gleaning from the conversation.  We begin to move the action forward when B is asked what she can do to integrate the learning she has gained.  NOT SO EFFECTIVE: We don't quite get to clear action steps and accountability in this recording (but it does get touched on before the end of the coaching session), and so don't hear any requests or challenges to move her life forward with action.  Also missing are opportunities to champion her.  The self-management could be tighter, particularly in times like when I begin ... 'if I were to guess ...'.  Curiosity would be a good anti-dote in such situations.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
