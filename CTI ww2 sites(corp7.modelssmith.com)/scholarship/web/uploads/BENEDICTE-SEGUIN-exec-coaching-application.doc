What does it look like ? What is valuable here ? What does he feel like being at the head of his future business ? How is he inspiring people ? What impact does he have on people ? Does he have a clear vision for himself from there ?  -Balance when I asked him to imagine a positive perspective of  being small  (in a business perspective) and the perspective of  not being liked  (personal perspective). Later in the session we talked about several options to look at his situation differently. And he decided to make a resonant choice from that.   -We also experienced the Process principle through the perspective of entrepreneurship. He felt confident, proud, strong in his chest and relaxed in his head. By the way I have been focusing on his whole person by using the mind and body language.     I used the context of curiosity and intuition through powerful questions and intruding  which helped my client clear his thoughts.   Also I used my level 3 listening to dance in the moment with what my client brought in our session.   I hold him naturally creative, resourceful and whole since I encouraged him to focus on his needs and resources to find his own solutions for his initial issue on being more firm when he negociates contracts. This is also about evoking transformation.       Improvements  -Listening level 2 and 3 : give more space to the client by asking less questions and having more self-management  -Few questions but more powerful ones. Sometimes it sounds like I was looking for a result. I should have been less attached.   -Less  focused on the being and more focused on forwarding the action   -More self-management. I am intervened too often.   -More deepening in the balance principle. I mean I could have deepened more the perspectives we talked about.   <br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Where the person would best be utilized? 1.
