Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I have been in love with CTI and what the company stands for since my earliest exposure.  It truly matches my values.  It would be so cool to be affiliated with such a cutting edge company that is doing some the most important work in the world (as I see it).  I would love including CTI on my resume, bragging that I am a part of that company's mission, and knowing that I would stand with so many world-class leaders who are making significant differences in people's lives.  It would represent a huge milestone in my own personal career, and catapult me onto a whole new level of leadership, expertise, and awesomeness.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I am terrified at the idea of being selected as a CTI leader.  I know this work would test me on every level, and push me right up against all my "edges" as a human being.  I'm petrified at the thought of standing in front of the room, co-captain of the vessel which is ferrying along the valuable destinies of so many diverse and "strong" personalities who are all longing, yearning for something as they enter the program.  Am I worthy?  Am I a fraud?  Can I actually deliver the goods?  Do I have what it takes?  I'm so afraid that I don't that I simply must find out.  Goodness knows I've been wrong before.  In Heyoka fashion, it seems that I must always move toward the thing I fear in order to overcome it, and becoming a CTI leader is something I deeply fear.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
