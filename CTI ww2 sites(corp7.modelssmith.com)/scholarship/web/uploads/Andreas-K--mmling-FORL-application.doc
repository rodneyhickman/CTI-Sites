Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love Co-active Coaching. I believe it is a great tool everybody should learn (if that was at all possible). I believe it takes human communication (and in fact all human interaction) to a completely new level. I adore it for the idea of man it holds, for the wholeness of its approach, for its devotion to the present moment and its impetus towards transformation. I am convinced that a world with only twice as many people exposed to the designs of co-activity as are now would already be a far, far better world. I am deeply connected to co-active coaching through the intuitive way of choosing it from a long list of coach trainings, which proved to be such a "right choice" for me.    I would love to be a co-active front-of-the-room leader, in order to have a more deep impact (in the depth of human personality) as well as wide impact (in the reach of the total number of people) on spreading co-activity in the world. I am eager to carry the vision of changing human interaction that way. I crave to deepen the impact of my Life Purpose ("I am the Sword who cuts the crap - with love!") and my Genius (which is "initiating development" by "affecting with words") that way.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>When Christiane Wild of Schouten Germany called me to suggest that I apply for the FORL auditions, as she was looking to enlarge the FORL pool with German-speaking candidates, I felt two different energies in me. First, pleasure - I felt flattered to be asked, to be seen fit for such a grand job. Then, how the heck can I possibly make it? There's only just more than a week left on the application period, I am not a CPCC yet and dozens of saboteurs feasted on the issue of why I was not fit for the job yet, why it could not possibly work out (totally Level 1, of course).    When Christiane asked me how the question landed with me, I felt it land. It really hit me: HOW THE HECK could I not grasp this opportunity? How could I possibly continue to play small and find excuses about "why I wasn't there yet" or why I did not want to pay the cost for the CPCC at this point in time, since I had other priorities in life? Only then it occurred to me how big a dream becoming a front-of-the-room leader had secretly been for me. A well-hidden dream that had totally sneaked away - and nearly into utter unawareness.    A few weeks earlier, at the German Co-active Alumni Day, someone pointed out to me how a new door opens when another one closes. I had just mentioned that I had lost business recently. Yeah, yeah, one door closes ... blah, blah. Heard it all before. Said it all before myself many times. But the doors closing never seemed to result in a grand opening; doors opening always just seemed to shift an inch a year.    And when Christiane called, I realized that what she suggested - despite opening a new door only ever so slightly - represented one of a rare few opportunities in my life so far, in which my URGE was so clear that I just HAD TO make the leap. OK, I let myself be called forth to pursue this secret dream of mine. Not just for all the Level 1 reasons mentioned above. But really because I feel called, called to shift gears, called to make the move. I cannot even describe what calls me or for what purpose. I just sense it will be important for me to follow the call. No matter what.    When I come to audition, I will stand there with my heart throbbing in my throat - like I did during open-mic-night at R3, when my leader Henry Kimsey-House had dubbed me the "Raw Man", as I had poured countless bottles of orange liquid down from my head to my toe, in order NOT to have a preparation in my head when I stepped up, in order to face the crowd and truly create from NOTHING. One of the scariest moments in my life and one of the most powerful. Possibly a crucial impulse for my start into leading groups, which my "up-until-Leadership" self had not dared to do, as I was scared stiff to speak in front of people (especially if more than 3, especially if unprepared). I will stand there (at auditions), knowing I might fail (ta-dah), knowing I will at the same time be able to gain tremendously just from being there, knowing that I will create impact. And knowing that I will be "on-purpose" for myself, "on-service" for the world and committed to both, whatever the outcome of the auditions may be. As much as I long to become a front-of-the-room leader, I also know that applying and stepping out already makes it worth all the while for me, growing into my purpose more strongly, whether I will be chosen or not. (I already felt something shift in my coaching during the recorded sessions I did for this application, so the new journey already has begun.)    P.S.: Apropos "one door closes" ... arranging for "new guinea-pigs" working with me on my recorded sessions brought me to the verge of taking in three new clients. My vision is to enroll them as clients accompanying me through my CPCC certification period.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

Importantly, I take the client to the land of experience and learning. Also, I evoke insights that give them an "aha-moment" and could be life-changing.    Purpose is an area that fascinates me personally and which still seeks more space in my coaching, as my impression is that clients do find the concept fuzzy sometimes. So, I was hesitant to jump at it when it first popped up in this coaching. I jumped at it on second chance and was very impressed with myself to have coached my client to a very powerful Life Purpose Statement within just 16 minutes. Especially, I am pleased that I was able to bottom-line it without any lengthy explorations of details and trusted my intuition that when I went forward my client would warn me if she did not agree with the direction. (In deed, my client confirmed this evaluation from her side after the session.)    On the other hand, what I am making up is that in this special "exam situation" I was sometimes "listening in too hard", that I was too "eager" to go deep with my professional curiosity. While I take it that I was creating a very safe container for the client, a place where everything is possible, failure is allowed and where growth is fostered, I have a sense that there was an energy of me "handling a raw egg". Thus, I am holding the vision for my own learning that I self-manage more to the effect that I will be a more self-confident dancer-in-the-moment under pressure, the "leading figure at the waltz", who gives himself permission to bring in even more liveliness and a clearer presence of who he is as a coach.    IN DETAIL: Not very surprisingly, curiosity and PQs were my entry point into the coaching, I did a good job at listening, focusing in with my questions to get down to the core. I articulated what was going on (pointing at the frustration, doubt, the intimate place the smile seemed to come from), followed my hunches (e.g. "you're frustrated", "smile in your voice" sounded almost "erotic", taking the eagle as the powerful metaphor without having to check in) and did a lot of mirroring, summarizing and bottom-lining. Humor (my I-AM-TYPE) always helps me connect and bring lightness. Holding the space (with short intervals of silence) did provide for opportunities for something else to come up. I focused on the fulfillment principle with a process back-up (in this case just a few questions on how "it feels". I stayed clear of the balance formula, which I tend to avoid, while I do usually work a lot with perspectives, powerful decisions and goals, which just did not have a place in this coaching. I even squeezed a bit of accountability in at the end. I am having a sense that what I was good at here is where I am more thoroughly grounded in general.    I see improvement areas for me in cutting some rather lengthy interventions short, bottom-lining on a larger scale, with briefer phrases, taking charge more that way. In the context of the 15-minute recorded session, I found myself a bit self-conscious, "handling a raw egg" (c. above), intruding and taking charge with hesitance rather than with clarity. (On the positive side, I do not believe that this had mattered much to my client.) Also, I lacked to connect the topic to my client's values. I believe all this is much less an issue in my regular coaching sessions. When I manage to change this (also with a view to the similar setup of the FORL demo coaching situation), I will be able to deepen the connection with the client and expand my range again. Finally, I could have deepened my client's commitment to her new LPS and acknowledged her for the great work done, whilst I was very focused on keeping time.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
