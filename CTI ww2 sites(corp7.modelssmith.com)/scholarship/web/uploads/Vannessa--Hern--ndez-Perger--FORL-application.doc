Level 1 response: : <br /><b>By being a CTI leader I want to experience my life purpose every time I lead, feeling profound love and passion for what I know it is not just work, but my calling on earth.     "I am the all powerful love that break you free to encounter your purpose in life".    Living my life purpose by working at CTI,  will make me feel like playing with excitement and wonder in the world of possibilities.  It will keep calling my authenticity and continuous self transformation, bringing full connection with myself and the people around me. Will allow me witness their transformation and marvel. Also, will connect me with my passion to travel around the world, experience cultural exchange, being able to offer and learn from different points of view...And much more.    BEING A CTI LEADER IS ONE OF THE BIG DREAMS OF MY LIFE.    Introducing co-active principles and its tools have brought to my life such a personal and family healing. Just after the Process course I was eager to give new steps towards forgiveness and acceptance to my mother and a few months later the miracle happened: she came back after 15 years of a broken relationship. It was a confirmation about how powerful the co-activity is when having the right heart intention!!! I am deeply grateful!!!    I am leading my life to my dream by deciding last January to make extra hours in my on-line marketing job, giving up many things and making my best effort in order to save money for May's 2013 Leadership course at Sitges, that I thought -  will allow me to participate in the next  FORL auditions whenever they were supposed to take place... - I almost couldn't believe it when one of the leaders sent me the application a couple of weeks ago...Oh my God... I am so exited to have this opportunity!!!!    Having lots of powerful examples about how co-activity changes people's lives and having integrated it first in my own, I would also like to mention how important has been for me to experience the excellence of the work of the leaders as well as the training structure.     I am quite an active member of the co-active family and would be a privilege and a honor to serve it with all my gifts and vulnerability as a Front of the Room Leader.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The vision of what I want to bring to the world as a CTI leader starts in the power of my captain that I see as a warm, bright, intense white light that comes from heaven across to Him, to me and across thousand, millions of people fulfilled in their body, their soul and spirit. This light is amazingly bright but doesn't harm your sight when you look directly at it. It is warm for the body and refreshes the soul and spirit. It cleanses and close the wounds, brings peace, so much love and tenderness. When this light is in, all the fears, rejection, doubts, lies and weaknesses run away. It brings self awareness of the gifts, talents, values and strengths like colorful precious gems allowing people loving themselves instead of judging. They start to know who they really are and become powerful creators of life instead of death. They use their power to accept life and others just as they are, celebrating the learning that lies behind each joyful and painful experience. They  create a great impact in the world by living their life purpose and showing their uniqueness. They become like teachers and mentors of many others that are silently yearning for the very same gift they have. All kind of bright colors and wonders, as never seen before, are being released and they will never be the same.       I have seen that variety of colors every time my coaching clients get one step closer to their dreams/growth and when I lead my on-line marketing team to do their job from their own values.     I dream to see entrepreneurs in Spain creating new job positions from a culture of  support, motivation, respect, communication that empowers their companies and employees.    I also dream to bring co-activity to my country, Venezuela and Latin America, where love, truth, awareness and freedom is so much needed in places suffocated by oppression and corruption,  where many brave leaders need support in confronting a system like a giant against them.    I also want to be part of the growth of the co-active community, powerful as I've rarely seen, performing as a container of support, learning, growth and a strong sense of belonging and identity for each of the members. The people I have met in my core curriculum have radically changed my life. This needs to reach millions of change agents all over the world!!!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

The first value was to share God's love through the music by asking her what was important about it.    A few times I articulated the L3 listening when feeling the "urge" of sharing this album and when her face showed passion, laughter or seriousness.  Also articulated the importance of her life purpose.    She found the importance of the passion value and connected it to salsa movements by using her body.       I was holding her resonance by asking powerful questions and using her body. I was always present and connected to her.    I could have also deepen the learning at powerful moments like "walking over the ocean" or staying with the "urge" of sharing her music or keeping her connected longer just to the "passion or love", but I preferred to dance in this moment with everything she was experiencing for the sake of her request of exploration.    I could have articulated at the end what exactly she was discovering about giving but also receiving from her music.    She had 3 good requests: dancing salsa to connect with the passion,  spend time every day with God and bringing a picture of the Ocean, all sources of power. I shouldn't have accepted her offer to go dancing in two weeks, I should have made a counteroffer to do it now and dance every day.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
