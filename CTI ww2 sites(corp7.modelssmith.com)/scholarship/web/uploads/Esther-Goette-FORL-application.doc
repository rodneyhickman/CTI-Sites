This is a face-to-face meeting. We have a good connection, I show curiosity and ask many powerful questions. I could have stopped her each time her saboteurs took over (""I'm not a good leader""..) and go deeper into different leadership situations or styles.   Initially the coaching is not following a particular principle, it finally lands in process. I chose this style because Barbara was ready to explode, and I sensed it, I wanted to give her an outlet to let it out and feel it. Alternatively I could have tried Fulfillment and get her in touch with who she wants to be, but I felt Process was asked for at this moment. I saw her squirming, I asked for permission, and off we went. I had another opportunity to attack her saboteur but I didn't want to spend time with this, I sensed that there was still something else that needed to be said and felt, and she said it: she wanted to ""explode"". I left her lots of space.   I asked unfortunately a closed question ""do you feel fear?"", and yet, my intuition was spot on. Should have asked it in a powerful way though..  And, sadly, I didn't make a request about homework for next time, but instead made a suggestion, of what could 'MAYBE"" be explored between now and then..
