Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I would like to be a CTI Front of the Room Leader for many reasons. Since my first day of CCC/Fundamentals in 2002 I have felt a very strong affinity to CTI's co-active model, unique experiential design and engaging co-leading style of delivery. For over 20 years I have been attending personal and professional development workshops and in my opinion there isn't anything like the power and magic of the co-active space that is generated in a CTI workshop! I have watched the co-leader dance as an assistant about 10 times for both content and process and would love nothing more than to be one of the leaders at the front of the room in a CTI workshop so that I can make a bigger difference in the world around me!  I feel excited about being a FORL for CTI as I believe it would be a strong fit for my top skills, strengths and passions (ie. coaching, training, co-leading, personal and leadership development, interpersonal relationship dynamics and evolving corporate culture). The role is fully aligned with my purpose of  'inspiring greatness in leaders, teams and relationships to raise personal consciousness and evolve corporate culture in service of world peace'.  I live in Vancouver and would love to lead here and would also be excited to travel to other cities to lead for CTI. Being a FORL for CTI would allow me to be part of the CTI difference in a bigger way and I would be able to increase my impact in the world with an organization I respect deeply in a role that is a natural extension of my personal and professional vision and values.   I am coachable, trainable and committed to lifelong learning and I know that working with CTI as a FORL would offer me valuable ongoing growth and development. In 2002 when I realized I wanted to be a FORL, I knew I was not yet ready but now I believe it is possible. The last 11 years have allowed me to grow personally and professionally and I am now a more seasoned workshop leader and coach. In addition, in terms of co-leading skills, I have had the fortunate opportunity to design and deliver about ten corporate workshops with one of your FORL's (Joni Mar) in the past few years. This has been a really valuable experience for growing my skills as a co-leader.      </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>CTI is passionate about 'changing business and transforming lives' and so am I! I would be honoured and humbled to be a FORL for CTI so I can serve more fully as a co-active catalyst in transforming  individuals, their relationships, organizations and humanity.  I am passionate about evoking transformation in people and organizations and I believe CTI FORL's can be very powerful role models for this kind of global change.   For over 10 years I have held the vision of the power of co-activity for people in organizational settings which is why I hired CTI/Cynthia Loy Darst to be a keynote speaker for the annual HR conference I was involved with for credit unions in BC. Her presentation on co-activity was extremely well received as I knew it would be! After that, to continue the work of CTI in credit unions I arranged for Cynthia and her husband David to deliver the Fundamentals to about 20 credit union participants who were looking to create a coaching culture in their organization. This was also well received. So, as a FORL I believe I would be able to leverage my passion for CTI's co-activity in organizations and make valuable connections with participants that could potentially bring more organizational opportunities to CTI.   In short, I believe organizations need more co-active culture and the world needs more co-activity and as FORL leader I believe I would be in a stronger position to help CTI spread this important magic.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>In terms of annual income, this is a little more than 50% of my typical annual coaching income. (This does not include income from other services such as workshops.)</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <b>2003</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.

What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>80%+ Typical client engagements relate to leadership development, people management, career fulfillment, personal leadership transition/outplacement, performance improvment</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Over the last 10 years I have coached about 10 partnerships and led about 30 different team coaching and team cohesion workshops. These sessions have been custom designed and group sizes have ranged from 8 to 30 people. Typically they have been 1 day in length. Many of these I have delivered on my own but a few of them I have co-led. In many of those instances I have use the Organization and Relationship Systems (ORSC) model as the foundation. Some were designed to support team vision, values and culture and others had the goal of creating greater collaboration and engagement. Some sessions involved facilitating team conflict which I enjoy. I would love to lead this kind of work for CTI one day. Here are a few testimonials: "The manager of yesterday's session came to me today and told me how great you were yesterday and how you controlled and managed their conflict team very well. He said you stood your ground and handled things in a way that allowed for everyone to share their feelings and experiences which resulted in a very cohesive team. He was very impressed. Thank you for your great work." -  Telus Manager  / "Our group of 10 consisted of office/administrative staff and professional facilitators.  One of the most important outcomes of the session was that we developed a vision statement, 'We Bring Life to Learning and Learning to Life', which we are all thrilled with. Sandy and her co-leader guided us through the difficult process and made it seem easy! We rated the session 91.4%.  I would not hesitate to recommend Sandy and her co-leader for any company who is looking for assistance in a strategic planning session, a visioning session or a team building workshop."- Leslie Clark, President, 3e Training Inc.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>Just a few workshops - 2 day coaching skills at UBC, 1 day coaching skills at Erickson College, 1 day workshop Executive Coaching with Backbone and Heart with Mary Beth O'Neill from Lios </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes, I am a subcontractor for two Vancouver based organizations. The volume of work I do for these organizations is fairly small in terms of my annual income and there is no minimum commitment required by either of them each year. They send me work when they have clients needing my services. For Corporate Symphony I mostly deliver Executive Coaching to individuals and for Centrepoint Career Management I mostly deliver team coaching and workshops. I would make sure that neither of these roles interfere with work I would do with CTI in terms of conflict of interest.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I would absolutely love to deliver Co-Active training inside organizations for CTI and believe my experience and passions make me a natural fit to do this work for many reasons.     I bring a strong background and understanding of the corporate environment . I have delivered upwards of 200 days of high quality training to teams and groups inside organizations for over 14 years ranging from workshops that were   1/2  day to 3 days in length both as an in-house trainer and an external provider. I am very comfortable leading in corporate settings and understand the different challenges and opportunities that arise in the corporate vs public workshop setting. I understand the people in the room and can set the context for who they are and where they come from. I am very comfortable delivering training to all levels from senior management to front line. Organizational participants who have attended my workshops have given me strong evaluations and testimonials.     I have had the good fortunate of co-designing and co-leading about 10 days of soft skills training inside organizations with Joni Mar in the last 4 years. All our workshops have received very high evaluations. I have really enjoyed delivering these workshop with her and it has given me excellent experience and learning about the co-leading dance. So while I have delivered the majority of my workshops over the years on my own, I have had this recent experience with Joni and have also co-led about a 10 other corporate workshops with others trained in co-active coaching or ORSC.     In terms of specifically delivering co-active training, I would be very comfortable with this content because all of the workshops I have offered over the years have either been directly related topics (eg. skills for better communication/relationships/interpersonal dynamics, leadership, etc) or have had a personal growth focus of some kind where as the facilitator I help people process their emotions as part of their learning.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>My biggest passion in work has always been to bring the kind of 'personal leadership' work that CTI does into organizations to raise personal fulfillment and organizational engagement. I see how much organizations benefit from powerful co-active conversations and how much the world needs more of CTI and I would love to play a bigger role in making this difference with CTI.    As a co-leader, I realize I would naturally have places to develop,  however, I believe I am  very collaborative and co-active as a co-leader and if I was hired as a CTI FORL I would be very open to the regular feedback and learning that would keep taking my FORL skills to the next level.    As a corporate employee and external consultant, I have had experience with top employers who have evolved and healthy cultures and I would like to be able to help organizations do this specifically with co-activity.     I am a strong advocate for CTI - I have recommended Fundamentals to at least 50 people over the years! If I was hired as FORL I would be very proud to be CTI Faculty. I believe I bring the solid credentials needed for this role and I really hope I will be invited to audition. I am excited at the prospect of auditioning!      And last but not least....Juhree Zimmerman (CTI Faculty) attended one of my workshops a few years ago and said this!: "Sandy  this is a great course. Your facilitation skills are superb! You are confident, light, respectful, radiant, clear and knowledgeable.
