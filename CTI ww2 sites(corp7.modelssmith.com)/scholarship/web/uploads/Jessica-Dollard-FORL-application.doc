I AM type: : <b>Charm/Sex</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Being a front of the room leader for CTI allows me to combine my values of service, high impact/game changer and spotlight. I have always wanted to make a change in the world and on the same hand I know that I "get the job done" when I am in the spotlight. I know that I am a highly synchronized and magical person.  All my life I have said that I am "lucky" but actually that is undercutting the gift I have.  I am more than just lucky - I am plugged in.  I will do great things for CTI as a front of the room leader and it will do great things for me.  The reciprocity will be endless and playful.    I have always felt that CTI and I are kindreds.  I too come from a theatre background and I feel that I am born to do this work. When I worked in theatre (acting, producing, and creating a feminist theatre company) I always felt that something was missing.  I loved the art, the nuance of listening required, the deep level of presence that I needed to find to "be in the moment" onstage, but I always wondered about impact.  In my blood, I know I am meant to have a global impact on the world and I never felt that theatre was quite the right launch pad.  Fast forward to my first CTI course - within a few hours I knew that I was completely synchronized with the foundational values and principles of CTI.     All of this grand talk is great (and sincere) but here's the truth - being a leader doesn't have to be changing the planet on a massive scale RIGHT NOW.  Sometimes I know my Saboteur is driving when I fall into that sort of thinking.  Actually it's the small daily acts that magically change the world.  When I stand in front of the room, whatever room it is, whether it's full of doctors, nurses, kids attending a queer youth camp and next, coaches-in-training and corporate Calgary, when I am modeling Co-Activity - designing, listening, acknowledging or any other skill that coaching has taught me - I know I am an agent of change in people's lives in small, high-impact ways.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>The space is calling me and the world (and yes, CTI) needs the expression of me that I offer in this application.  I bring a youthful, charming, sexy, quirky, yogi/spiritual and queer voice to your team.  And sometimes I slip into healthcare speak and share powerful stories from that experience.  I'm young, I've created some cool shit already and that's a powerful message to send through a front of the room leader.  At first I wasn't going to write this application but actually it was the space that invited me to step in. Frankly, I am not a CPCC yet (but will be soon after auditions unless they let me write my oral exam early) despite having over 200 hours of coaching under my belt, last year I put off Certification in favour of Leadership.  But then I noticed the space - it nudged me forward. The space said, "Do it anyway".  One of the powerful things I learned at leadership was all around being big.  My tribe told me that I fail as a leader when I play small and give away my power.    If I didn't apply, I'd be having an impact and that would be playing small and holding back. I'd be creating a "sell-yourself-short-and-wait-and-see" level 3.  What the space tells me is that I need to keep putting myself out there and jumping.  I am impacting the space RIGHT NOW by saying: play big, don't hold back, don't be afraid to fail, apply even if you can't quite tick off every box right now, believe that the world needs this expression of you.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.  You would lead mainly in your country of residence. We have courses in many locations throughout North America, Europe, and outside of Europe. You may be asked to travel to locations outside your country of residence. : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	How often will you be willing to travel to a course location outside of your city/country of residence? : <br /><b>I can travel (and love to!) anytime I am needed.  I will need as much notice as possible to coordinate with my job but I can make it happen. I maintain a high degree of organization with my own schedule- until I throw that out the window!  I also thrive on being spontaneous. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How often will you be available to lead?  (e.g. one course/month) : <b>As many as requested.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	Are you available to lead mid-week courses?  How often?  : <br /><b>Of course! Once a month during mid-week times feels like a maximum. If I get this job I will make an arrangement with my employer, even it means going down from full-time.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	Are you available to travel internationally to lead courses? : <b>Of course!</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section E:  Your Coaching : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>I have maintained a private client roster of 6-12 private clients since I finished the core curriculum in June of 2012.  I also coach internally at Alberta Health Services and because this is a forty-hour a week commitment, I do keep my private clients to a maximum of 12 (even 12 is a few too many, 10 is more comfortable balance wise).</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>Again, my private practice is kept to a manageable number; I am coaching 6 people this week outside of work, I have 9 upon writing this application.  As an internal coach in healthcare my clients range from 2-8 per week.  These relationships are much more informal and on a by-needs basis.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	What has been your monthly coaching income on average so far this year? : <br /><b>This month I will make exactly $1,110 from my private coaching practice and 30% of my salary is coaching based so in total that would $1,900. This is slightly above my average.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What percentage of your estimated 2013 annual income does this represent? : <br /><b>The estimation I would offer is around 40% and that includes my private clients and the percentage of my job that is made up of coaching.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5.	When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>I began receiving payment for my coaching on the second day of Fundamentals when we were required to coach a client, which would be January 28, 2012.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.	What is your current market niche or the primary profile of your client base? : <br /><b>My niches are: health care workers including administrators, nurses, doctors and leaders, artists, LGBTQ people, youth, people challenged my mental illness and not-for-profit administrators. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7.	What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b> I work at Alberta Health Services in Patient Engagement as an Education Consultant and in my position I coach, lead workshops and create curriculum to help healthcare providers become more effective listeners and find empathy for their patients.  This makes up about 30% of my practice (as above).  Please note that Alberta Health Services is a publically funded organization but it is run very much like a corporation, at arms length from the government.  Recently I have been invited to do group/team coaching at a Calgary oil company but that will begin in the fall of 2013. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>I have limited experiences coaching relationship - a handful of clients.  At work I am constantly informally coaching teams, units and advisory groups (made up of volunteers).  These are usually one-off type scenarios (it is either an air drop in for repair or to design the alliance) and that is why I call it "informal".</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>None. I'll be pursuing a Masters degree or will become a certified Mediator in 2014.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	What workshops/programs/courses have you lead in the past two years? : <br /><b>My experience leading workshops started right after R2 in August of 2012 and since that time I have thrown myself in and I am quite comfortable in leading with other coaches, co-workers and on my own. I bring Co-Activity to my work in all scenarios.    I have an arsenal of content that I mix and match like standardized moveable elements including: improv games from Keith Johnstone, theatre games, and fulfillment and balance coaching tools. I don't have canned workshops at work or in my private practice. I cater each workshop to the organization/group after doing  needs assessment.    Here's the short-list of experience from work and my private practice:  -Three workshops for artists (with different co-leaders) on how to become their own biggest fans.  -Two workshops for Yoga practitioners blending fulfillment coaching and yoga theory/asana.  -Workshops for youth to build self-esteem (namely queer youth) and group accountability (using some fulfillment coaching tools).  -Workshops for ArtsRecruits (a program that supports people diagnosed with a mental illness to facilitate learning a life or employment skill through the arts). This is an ongoing contract.  -Workshops on Empowering your Patient and Introduction to Patient and Family Centered Care (here the content is partially my what my department uses and blends the above arsenal) for doctors and medical students.  -Workshops for healthcare providers on The Four Habits Model (a technique to connect more deeply with your patients during the medical interview), source: The Permanente Journal.  -Workshops as above using a complete variety of content and techniques for all types of healthcare providers from nurses, unit clerks to environmental service workers, again, these are not standardized but are catered to each group's needs.    What's next?  Private Practice: Currently I am planning a workshop with a Co-Active co-leader Chad Herst, called, What's your TED talk?, wherein we plan to take participants on a journey culminating on the last day in giving their TED talk to a live audience.  Healthcare: I have just been put in charge of developing the curriculum and workshops for all of Alberta to teach AHS staff about Patient Engagement and Patient and Family Centered Care.  This will range from shooting educational videos, developing e-learning and delivering experiential workshops.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>Yes, as mentioned above my role as an Education Consultant in Patient Engagement puts me in a position to lead workshops regularly across Alberta.  Patient Engagement is all about bringing the perspective of patients and families to the planning and delivery of healthcare at all levels of implementation - from the bedside to the boardroom.  In my job I help healthcare providers be able to see their work through the eyes of their patients.  The other big piece of this is Patient and Family Centered Care which is all about helping healthcare providers empower their patients as full partner in their own care (because they are experts in being "Dan-the-patient").  This means teaching doctors how to bring respect and dignity and a spirit of collaboration and participation to their delivery of care.  Basically it means shifting health care providers into the perspective of their patients being naturally creative, resourceful and whole.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>I honestly believe that doctors are the "toughest" audiences on the planet (lawyers and politicians as well?) and I have to be extremely agile in dancing in the moment to connect with them. The approach definitely feels different but I've learned when to meet them and when to pull up the vibration/energy of the level 3 and lead them (of course I would never say "vibration" or "energy" to them! Ha!).   I have also learned to let go of my own stories about what "success" looks like when it comes to connecting to different people.  Before my job in Patient Engagement I was used to working with artists (who will cry and check their emotional temperature in every moment) and the switch to leading doctors (where success looks like a furrowed brow of curiosity and engaging with thoughtful questions) was fairly smooth but I needed to let go of my own saboteurs at first.    All this to say - if I can be Co-Active with disenfranchised doctors - I can work inside corporations.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Here is a note that I wrote to Rick and Karen after Leadership that I wish to share as I feel it answers this question while clearly expressing who I am and what I do very clearly (I did edit for length):  ?"This week I busted Co-Activity onto the scene of health care in Calgary!!!! The content I created for the workshops (I did 5 this week) is similar to what is standard for our department - but it was HOW I led it - it was WHO I was being up there that made all of the difference- it was incredible! In the workshops I led alone, I was able to be Co-Active with the participants (who were doctors) and then today I co-led with a co-worker and I was co-active with her and then low-and-behold - she was Co-Active back! Of course, she was.  She didn't use though words but we created magic together.    The participants were laughing, crying and ready to step into their leadership. My stake was similar to the stake of Leadership: we are all leaders, we are all always having an impact, we are infinitely powerful...?I am ASTOUNDED by the power of Co-Activity and I believe that I am meant to bring it to health care in a massive way.     Imagine a healthcare system empowered to care for the people we love when they are most vulnerable - designed to love and respect the person inside the patient. A system where healthcare providers focus on the whole person, not just the disease - where they listen into the level 2-4 while holding the incredible knowledge to heal in their level 1, where doctors dance in the moment with their patients rather than being right... I can see it. I saw it today. I saw it their faces."?  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

She is dancing between trusting her stake, she is hungry to learn about recovering to her self and she is utterly committed to the Leadership program.  Throughout we do a dance with her Saboteur who is telling her that asking her tribe to show up on iCohere is selfish (and she should not have needs when it comes to her leadership experience) but ultimately the most powerful questions of the session of "What do you need?" and "What are you afraid of?" align her with her value of authenticity. She realizes that she is leading with a deep level of intimacy and asking her tribe to "come with her".  At 1:10 I abruptly moved her away from really appreciating what "feeling it in her body" was like with a rushed (therefore not a powerful question) "So you've stuck this stake in the ground".   A more powerful choice would have been to have her really notice what she had felt in her body.  It might have moved us forward more quickly.  At 1:30 the "What do you need?" question first arrives in the space, doesn't quite get through and at 3:13 "what do you need?" is sidelined for a series of acknowledgements of which only 2 land: "You are so dedicated to this process" and "You are really in your leadership right now". Less is more when it comes to acknowledgements and they don't require explanation.  I do feel that the two acknowledgements that landed allowed her to feel seen and known and empowered her leadership.  At 7:45 I choose to share about my experience to evoke transformation in the client.  I was not attached to what she takes away from the story but I was committed to helping her step into her power. At 8:40 I share about myself again not as powerfully and didn't have a clear answer when she asked me how I recover - I am still a little hooked by this learning!  My first instinct in the absence of a clear answer was to turn to the course material for R2. It wasn't as authentic but it was an example of recovery!  At 10:50 - break through! The "what do you need" thread came through.  I needed to self-manage and step back and let her enjoy that more. It was her win. More time might have been needed for her to relish in "I deserve to have the greatest leadership experience possible". Taking more time to celebrate the success of her leadership may have also taken the session forward more quickly as well.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
