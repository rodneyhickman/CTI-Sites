I feel that sometimes, I did not give my client enough space, especially at the beginning of the coaching.  I should have used geography when my client was talking about the creative world. In order for her to feel the importance of it and what's possible in this world versus the english literature world.  While talking about the poem, I feel I could have gone more deeper and understand her feeling and need for writing poetry. And how she could re-connect to her passion by writing poems.  She spoke about discovery. I should have been more curious about the meaning of it and what's possible from there.  I could have asked her how could she remain creative in her world outside of school, in her daily life and transfer everything in a creative way.  I got lost when she spoke about her family and decided not to go there, I did not get attached to the past. Maybe I should have explore a bit? Not sure.  During the last 2 0r 3 minutes I got lost and tried to reconnect her to her passion but I felt desonance from my client. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
