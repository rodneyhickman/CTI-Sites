And the Topic is My level of Energy  Session with a sense of strong relation, connection, aliveness, and complicity between the coach and coachee.   Cornerstones are present: There is dancing where she is or goes (with wand metaphor), it is widened to her whole life (not only to her relation with students in class), and the coachee is hold as naturally creative, resourceful and whole.  Contexts: There is a lot of Level 2 (I?m hearing lots of "I have to", I can see you breathe), some level 3 & intuitions (what?s the real issue here?), and curiosity is also present.   Principle: Balance - use of the formula, arriving to a resonant choice for her. Good to stop in each perspective, and look for the energy of each one.   Skills: There are many powerful questions (What is it for you to play?). There is some AWGO and intruding (I?m hearing load, expectancies...), some acknowledge (you?re a very energetic person), good use of geography (with space and body, also like when articulating "be aware how your body is different here in this perspective"), Aliveness and Connection. Championing (so open the curtains!). There is also sense of taking charge and authority ("maybe this is another perspective, and I want to keep you in the playful perspective")  Development areas  There are some good opportunities to go deeper in some moments (as the "exhausting" answer at the very beginning - for instance, with a "tell me more", or the time issue also at the beginning, could be more curious). More use of intuition would have been great; for instance: I don?t have time - I could have articulate something like "I have the intuition the real issue is not about having time".   It could be more Level 3 (some sounds -alarms, bird singing- could have been used.  More use of the client metaphors, The dog barking - metaphor or the carpet. I could have been more curious there. Also could be more curiosity in other moments such as when she says it is important to talk about it , with a kind of question like: What is it different when you talk about it?  More intentionality in some moments; when I say "I hear a lot of .. I have to..., this sounds like an obligation", I could do something with it (for instance asking something like "how does it land?"  Also after each perspective, it would have helped to have a look at the topic before moving to the next one.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
