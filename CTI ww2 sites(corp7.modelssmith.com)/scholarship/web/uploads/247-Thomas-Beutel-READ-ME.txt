Thank you for your purchase of an ebook from A Book Apart. Our ebooks are available in three formats: ePub, PDF, and Mobi. 

The ePub format is the industry standard and is supported by all iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod), as well as the Nook, Sony Reader, Stanza, and Adobe Digital Editions. 

The Mobi format is supported by Amazon's Kindle.

The PDF can be read in Adobe Acrobat or Preview (on the Mac), as well as many other devices and programs.

In addition, two books--CSS3 for Web Designers and Responsive Web Design--also include a video ePub. The video ePub is supported only by iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod); it is identical to the standard ePub save for one exception: where appropriate, static screenshots have been replaced by video demonstrations.
