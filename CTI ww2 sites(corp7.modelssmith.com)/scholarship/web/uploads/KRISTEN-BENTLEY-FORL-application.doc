Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Why do I want to be a front of the room leader?   I can't not! I often share that I don't know whether I found CTI or CTI found me - it was a mutual finding and a coming home. I want to be a front line catalyst in this transformative work. In addition to using it with my clients I want to train people that will they themselves be transformed and then go out and use their transformation in service of transforming others. I want the world to be co-active. I have been blessed with a gift of love and compassion for others. I fiercely stand for them defining, owning and living the life that is truly important to them. I have 2 resonant Life Purpose statements right now that tie into each other: "I am the delicious grounded angel of beauty that teaches and inspires you to see the unseen roots that connect us all." AND "I am the northern shooting star that startles you into magically....falling....madly....in LOVE with yourself." These 2 combined are the birthplace of self-compassion and compassion for other, the birthplace of seeing what we have in common and celebrating diversity and owning and being and doing - YOU! This is where world peace is born.   I want to be a FORL because at my core, I am a peace activist - first step in world peace comes through inner peace and from there outer peace with everything and everyone. The Co-Active model, to me (and many others) is a magic model that helps people find this in themselves and others.   I want to be a FORL because I LOVE this model. I believe it is a coaching model, philosophy, conversation style and life-stance that guides you to find out who you are and to use that as a conscious guiding system in your life.  I want to be a FORL because CTI has been a gift to me and I want to pay it forward.    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>My level 3 read...people are waiting to be found, waiting for this magic remedy. There is pain and suffering from dissonant, unconscious, externally defined living and an external search for love.  What I have realized as a result of being in so many CTI classrooms, as a participant and assistant, is that human beings are beautiful and they are hungry for this humanistic, inside out continual growth. I marvelled at the incredible group of 25 people in my fundamentals class. I thought that somehow, the 25 best people in the world were gathered together for 3 days. 15 or so groups of 25 people later, I have realized People ARE this way AND when they are supported to be this way and interacted with in a way to bring out their best they shine and show up and it ripples out and they pay it forward.    Why do I want to be a FORL - level 3 response?  My impact as a leader is inspiring, loving, compassionate, fierce, fearless, limitless. When I am leading, I create a space that is inviting, accepting, non-judgemental. The space feels seen, heard, understood and called forth. It feels like life is breathed into it. It is colourful, playful, and whimsical. There is clarity and it feels capable. It feels brighter, lighter, like a light has gone on or a weight removed. There is impactful silence, a knowing beyond words where time stands still. There is discovery, crushes and falling in love. From here, the space feels energized and ready to create, shift, move towards what it has/is falling in love with.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.
