I loved the use of intuition e.g. how I turned this client from her father to herself. I was persistent in identifying a topic whilst allowing the client to "vent" or "clear". I could have interrupted earlier and this was a missed opportunity. I like the powerful questions "What do you believe about.....".  I was unattached. Turning  the client back to herself and staying with her last word as the beginning of the next question. I loved that I moved from working hard before to this particular session when I did not work so hard. Landing a topic and having fun doing it. Used the metaphor of dancing?. I like that we explored through questions. We reviewed homework! The client brought it up. Prior to this, it was like pulling teeth. I used recognition and celebration e.g. the walk on the beach. Questions are key throughout. My client Caryl and I were connected!!!!  I had no agenda and no outcome in mind. I stayed curious e.g. God, Love and Flow!!   How. I stuck with questions and my client gained incredible insight. I needed to ask "What are you taking away? What are you learning?  This was so much fun.
