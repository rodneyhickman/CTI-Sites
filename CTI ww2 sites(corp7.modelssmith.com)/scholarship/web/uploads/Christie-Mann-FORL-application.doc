Level 1 response: : <br /><b>LEVEL 1 Bottom-line:  Because it's my purpose AND CTI needs someone just like me?!  ~  I've know since I walked into my first core curriculum course in 2007 that this was/is my purpose and since that time I have been laser focused on developing my own mastery of the coaching skill-set, being more co-active as a person and bringing more co-activity into everything that I do (please see bio and resume to back up this statement and know that I come back to the classroom, as an assistant at least once a year to give back, replenish and go deeper with the model).      Although I've found my own way to do this work in the world, I've never taken my focus away from this moment of becoming a CTI FORL.  I want to be doing this from the mother ship; through CTI I can do this work globally, align myself with the most prestigious coaching institute in the world and get the opportunity to co-lead with the best of the best.  I know that this will have a tremendous impact on my own personal growth, which is one of my top values and give me opportunities to continue to master my life's calling.    I have been told (and I know it too) that I am extremely skilled and impactful at the front of the room.  When I'm leading - time stops, my saboteur leaves the building and I become so dialed in to the space and the participants that magic unfolds and transformation takes place.  I am a masterful L2 and L3 listener and I am able to dance in the moment with whatever comes up and create learning from everything.  I'm flexible and open and embrace opportunities to co-lead with other passionate leaders.  This is now the time to make this vision a reality.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>LEVEL 3 BOTTOM-LINE: I want to be a part of the global movement of spreading co-activity with individuals and organizations. I want others to get what I got and continue to get out of the model, I want more people to find their quest and be on purpose. I want to live in a world where people have the ability to listen on a deeper level, acknowledge and champion people for their authenticity and unique abilities and call people forth to be their best selves.   ~  I completely believe in and live the co-active model and it would be a great honor and privilege to lead/coach and train future co-active coaches. Shortly after being accredited, I landed the Bank of Montreal as a client and since that time I have been involved in the design, development and delivery of coach-training programs across the enterprise (and other organizations as well) where I have trained over 3,000 leaders and been successfully involved in tracking and measuring the impact of coaching to business results.   Let's talk more about this!  I am skilled and competent with translating co-activity and ""coach-speak"" to the corporate audience and in my quest to infuse more co-active leadership into the corporate world; I'm also conducting business development on behalf of CTI.  As an official CTI Business Affiliate in Toronto and New York, where I have large and credible corporate networks, I am working on leveraging my relationships to get CTI in the door to spread the power and magic of co-activity. I feel that this is an important asset I offer (along with the fact that I am a CTI Organizational Coach), as making this powerful content accessible to the business community takes precision, sensitivity, business acumen and an understanding of this environment.  It is a culture and language onto itself of which I am well versed, have years of experience in both working for and consulting to leading organizations where I have been well received.  I am on a mission to bring more co-activity into the work place and being a FORL for CTI will be another avenue for me to make this happen.     I also believe that Toronto and New York City are hot markets for CTI right now and that with only two home-leaders in Toronto and my extensive networks in both T.O. and NYC; selecting a fiery, compassionate, sex-type with over 12-years of corporate experience, masterful front-of-the-room and coaching skills and a zest for business development - is the best business decision for CTI to make.    In addition to corporate clients and in a desire to give back and make positive meaning of my own struggles as a teenager, I have co-designed and have been delivering a series of experiential leadership developmental workshops to vulnerable youth of the Catholic Children's Aid Society in Ontario and juvenile detention centers in California - making this, my very most important venture to date. This is my passion project and my quest which came to me this past winter; where my skills, passion and life experience came together, what an aha moment that was... Doing this kind of work with this audience is important to me because my father was incarcerated when I was 13 years-old and with the tools I have acquired through CTI and the experience I've gained over the years, I am now in a place where I am giving back with the aim of making a difference in at least one child's life.      OK, I hope the above allows you to see how CTI and co-activity has helped (and continues to help) me in the pursuit and achievement of my quest(s) and how our quests align.  I'm ready to get more steeped in the model and develop more co-active champions in the world in order to spread this great work and make a meaningful and lasting impact.  So, please pick me for an audition, as I am bound and determined to be a part of your team to continue this strong alliance and transformational work together.  I'm ready to ROCK! Yours in co-activity!

Throughout this time I have also steadily maintained 5 private clients where I use the co-active model. In June, I made the business decision to build my private practice to make more time to do business development on behalf of CTI and so my goal is to have between 10 - 15 private coaching clients by the end of September.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.

What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <br /><b>In early days with my work at BMO, I was trained and certified in a model anchored in Applied Behavioral Science through CLG (Continuous Learning Group).

CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>Please see my bio and resume to illustrate that I have a lot of first-hand experience in the corporate world.  I started my ?rst start-up in 2003 and as President of my own marketing consulting ?rm I worked directly with McDonald's Restaurants Franchisees to raise the profile of restaurants in the community and drive sales from a local-level, while consulting to Toronto's largest Business Improvement Area Association on the design, development and management of a Visitors Information Service, which still stands today in Toronto's Yonge-Dundas Square.  I later moved on to McDonalds Corporate where I experienced my own trials and tribulations of leadership and got my first taste of coaching as I led the recruitment, development and management of an Ontario-wide community relation's team.  It was at this pivotal time that I discovered my passion for leadership and coaching.     In 2007 during my own extensive coach and leadership training with CTI, I began to consult to start-ups such as Massive Media and Blink Media Works on the west coast of Canada on corporate culture programs, while providing coaching to senior and executive level-leaders. My practice and reputation continued to grow in 2009, when I turned my attention to Performance Coaching at The Bank of Montreal where I continue to provide executive coaching, coach-training, design/delivery and project management services.       My career path came full-circle this spring when I landed a contract working with my very first leaders from McDonald's Restaurants Ltd., where I am currently co-designing leadership development seminars for the Women's Leadership Network and will begin delivery of the series this summer to over 250 brilliant leaders who make up this internal community.    I am extremely dedicated and passionate about infusing co-activity into the corporate world, too many people, spend too much of their time here and it needs to be a more healthy, productive and supportive environment for our society and culture to get positive, meaningful and lasting impact.     </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.

What's here with that?"  o	At 13:36 the use of Process; "where do you feel freedom, in your body, where do you feel that? What's it feel like?  o	14:09 use of intuition/listening/calling forth; "something that I've noticed, with your great laugh, when you say something like what you just said...and my sense is that there is something that you cover up in your laugh, what's the truth in that?"  o	14:35 Process - "what's coming up right now?" "What are you're emotions telling you?" 15:58 - "what do you feel in this moment?" 16:13 - curiosity - "how do you know that?"  o	17:23: Evoking Transformation/Fulfilment - "What's it costing you to be driving yourself like that?" 18:11 - Fulfilment "What would you feel like physically if that was happening?"  o	18:25 - Process: "in this moment, what do you feel like in this moment?"  o	18:48 Dancing in the moment/curiosity/process; "What's it like not to know?"  o	18:57 Deepen/Forward "how does this feeling of not knowing, link it back to getting more control of your schedule." (her coaching topic)  o	19:46 intuition - "my sense is the disconnect is...."  o	22:34 Deepen/Forward - "what could you take from this conversation that could help you get more control of your schedule?" 24:00 Deepen/Forward, I made a request - "I wonder what it would be like for you everyday to do xxx (she said is would be a good thing) "So, what would a next step/action look like..." I asked for commitment; "on a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to this action?"  o	26:00 Deepen/Forward - Accountability - I asked her to bottom line the action and then linked it back to her coaching topic; "how is this going to support you in getting more control of your schedule?"  o	26:55 Champion - "And Catherine, you're so worth it...."    What was not an effective demonstration of Co-Active coaching in this session:  o	Overall there were missed opp'ys to use the principle of Fulfilment for the client to go deeper in exploring her saboteur and a couple of areas where I didn't get as curious as I could've with what was in the L2, there a couple of examples were I made assumptions and stated my opinion on what was happening for the client:  o	20:25 -22:20 Fulfilment - call out of saboteur missed opportunity to go deeper and more clearly define saboteur.  I think it was really obvious to me that is was saboteur and when I called it out she acknowledged it too but listening back I think I pushed my agenda a bit here and should've gotten more curious about this with her  o	23:27 "The moments we took to just breathe...and you noticed how you tapped into the emotion...and I know it was raw and vulnerable - thank you for going there...."  Missed opportunity to really CHAMPION & ACKNOWLEDGE her. I made the acknowledgement more like a side note versus really acknowledging her for going to a place that was uncomfortable.  o	28:30 - Great that I linked it back to the topic and checked in on impact of coaching "how do you feel we did with your topic, do you feel as if you got some strategies to help you deal with your schedule?"...but there was a missed opportunity to dive a bit deeper in L2 as she didn't sound completely confident in her action, I heard saboteur and I went to Process and then called out the saboteur and should've checked this out and done a little more self-management versus making assumptions and stating my opinion so clearly....    </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
