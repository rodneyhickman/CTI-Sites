I did a good job of moving the client's focus off of changing another person's behavior, using gentleness and humor, to looking at how she could offer herself that treatment she was looking for.  She used the word respect; I brought energy to that word.  When the client used an image she had of another couple;  I shifted the image to treating herself with that same gentleness and respect.  The 5-star hotel image brought up an image of self-care.  I tied those two concepts, respect for self and self-care in to the coaching, and back to her agenda.  I paused the client a number of times to allow her to steep in the images and senses she was wanting for herself.  Her temptation is to 'do' and I encouraged her to 'be.'  I reflected back a lot of the client's own words to deepen her experience.  I used her environment as part of the coaching.    I brought her back to see where these important things live in her.  When she couldn't find something I didn't judge, I gently reminded her that it was simply good information, and then we were able to explore deeper.  I followed the client to where her ideas, and sensations were taking her, and I always maintained the connection to her agenda. When using images I asked permission to stay with the images if it was something I had brought up.  In forwarding the action, I gave her permission to not get it right all the time by reminding her she was new at this and not an expert yet.  I allowed silence to do its work, and in doing so the action was more specific than just the 'respect bubble' she was going to create.  I felt that could get lost so I asked her to set up a reminder image near that space.  I had a tendency to say 'yeah' a number of times for encouragement, but it wasn't necessary.  I did bring attention to myself at one point, when the client talked about bringing wood products into Canada.  Being Canadian I made a connection to that.  I quickly let go of it though and went straight back to the client.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
