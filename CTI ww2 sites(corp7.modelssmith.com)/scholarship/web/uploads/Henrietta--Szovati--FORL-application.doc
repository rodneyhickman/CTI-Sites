I bring hearts to a deep place. I bring awareness, substance and depth. The space is open, vast and full of potential. It is a place where- when I am fully in tune with myself- I navigate people to their heart with a ""heart awakener""  fresh energy.   I also notice that the space where I lead has a lot of unanswered questions, dilemmas, hurts in people's lives. There is a need for telling the truth.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

She came to coaching to be supported in building her own coaching practice. My main challenge with her is to hold the space for her to remember that she is doing to others what she is not doing for herself: believe in her abilities authentically and wholeheartedly.   What went well in this coaching demo:   In the submitted segment of the coaching session I mainly used process and balance coaching. I quickly identified that she finds it difficult to be in her body when there is a need to step up (e.g. noticed her blushing) so when I asked her to "breathe out of herself" that created a powerful shift. It created a distance and space for her to see where she is and, in fact, who she is being! I feel  I have not fully managed to get into the "it" stuck energy but in hindsight, this was the very first time in our coaching relationship when she started to become much clearer about her own ways of being, not just the doing.  I feel I created a safe space for her to explore her body reactions and thinking patterns. I felt the dance in this moment and I held her a whole person.   I used powerful questions, articulation of what is going on, acknowledgement and requesting very effectively and at the appropriate times during the session.   Areas to grow:   In identifying a step forward, I took charge in suggesting the treasure chest. This has been part of our designed alliance for me to take charge when it comes to "creative" suggestions but I am pulling back from taking charge and allowing her to step forward with her own creativity.  In creating more space for the client I would like to focus on bringing more courage and widening the range and embodiment with this client as a way to enhance her presence and growth.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
