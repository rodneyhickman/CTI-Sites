What I did well was my powerful questioning associated to the space I gave him (silence after the questions) that took him in the future, brainstorming with him on what he was feeling, exploring deeper the resonance by dropping some words that are linked to his values. Listening at level 2 and 3 allowed me to spot some impatience (his saboteur), and bypassing it by asking other powerful questions to make him experience deeper his vision ("let's concentrate on your vision: what is so precious about it?" Articulating what was going on, and taking charge, I helped my client to bring that vision into his reality, and feel the urge that it can start now and forward the action ("you've got something here: what do you want, for now?").  I could have explored even deeper the vision and the resonance by getting my client to embody the feelings we were discussing. Questions could have been shorter and therefore more impactful, and I could have reinforced the being with my client.  My learning is to embrace 100% the cornerstone "Focus on the whole person", and expand my range and be bold. Dare taking very pragmatic people (my clients and me too!) into unknown spaces.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
