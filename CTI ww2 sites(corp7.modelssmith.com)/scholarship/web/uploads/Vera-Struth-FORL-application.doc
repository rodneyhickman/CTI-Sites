Level 1 response: : <br /><b>I love delivering training to people, especially if it is about a topic that I am passionate about. People come to a training session for development and are (on average, if they are not ,,sent" by their boss) curious and open for something new. I love to provide opportunity for new insights and see people develop and grow. Ideally this is not a one-off training session but rather a curriculum where you can support people over a time of growth. And this is exactly what CTI provides with its coach training. It combines development opportunity/space on a subject that I am passionate about and this in terms of a curriculum to support people in a phase of growth and change.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I had the great opportunity to be recommended to go on a CTI course and all through since Fundamentals I was clear that I want to be ,,on the other side", I wanted to be in front of the room, help people develop and guide them through that growth path in the same way that my leaders did. My quest carries the name ,,Forming teams to tribes" and centers around ,,TRUST", which is the foundation for extraordinary relationships ( in groups or as an individual with its surrounding). In the level 3 I would love to inspire trust and whatever is needed for individuals or groups to develop.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>In my 10 years as an HR professional I worked every day with Managers (on their topics with staff members) and work teams focused on their relationships & development. Being a scout for 30 years I have broad experience in working with groups as well. Both parts are clearly not ,,pure" coaching but are based on the approach of not being the expert but more a sparring partner/mentor/sounding board to support -so close to coaching. Furthermore I just moved into working as a coach and trainer in the corporate world since March 2013, so this is my fulltime role now.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.	What experience, if any, do you have of coach training other than your CTI experience? : <b>none</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section F:  Your Experience Leading : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.

Are you a contracted leader/trainer or faculty member for another organization/institution?  If yes, please describe your role and commitment. : <br /><b>I am a self employed trainer and coach working with 3 partners under the brand name of "Pelargos - Essential Advisory" (for more info please see www.pelargos.net). Each of us has his/her area of experise (e.g. change management, strategic consulting, headhunting...) and portfolio of clients but we collaborate a lot according to client needs. The commitment is to work mainly under our brand name and in collaboration when approaching the market, but we are free to expand our services or deliver under other brand names.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3.	CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>As an HR Senior Manager, designing and delivering training on various topics was part of my day to day job. Having worked for two global companies and working with a partner that is a specialist for systemic consulting for organizations now, I am used to work as a consultant for organizations and feel at a good starting point to bring coaching into corporates.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Teams and groups inspire me even more than working with individuals as the topic of "Trust" broadens greatly (not only trusting yourself as an individual, but building trust relationships in your work place).   Furthermore, larger groups bring more diversity and thus more colors and energies in L3.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

Topic: client has been leader of a scout group, is currently living abroad but would love to be in touch/still active but without intruding.    We started with clarifying the topic/ what the client really wants and then moving to what he wants for "his tribe" ?"commitment" and "moving beyond comfort zone". I offered "visioning" (in an ideal world what would you do?) but client had problems to go there and saboteur came up. I offered perspectives 1)"Parent" and 2)"Teacher" (client is training to be a teacher) and as a 3rd he gave a perspective ("Guardian") that gave more insight. From there we moved into "experience" which is on the recording.    What worked: If X does not work, try something else ( from visioning to perspectives and there trying several until you find one with aliveness );  Stay on it, don't give up if intuition tells you there is sth;  Away from thoughts into the experience is what gave him most insight;  Going his speed (very reflective, for me slow at times) felt good to him;  Intuition on "guardian is not what tribe wants" was confirmed  "managing self" worked(I have never been so tired for personal reasons right before a coaching and was temped to delay  - client did not realize);  at the end of recording I move client out of "experience" a little to early, so I ask him if he is ok to jump back in, which gave the final resonating insight, so intuition and dancing in the moment gave the deepening    What did not work:  From my perspective the energy was low and the whole coaching felt slow to me ( maybe due to my tiredness), so I would go back to design the alliance to point out again, that he can request more of what he wants, "everything is possible" and point out that I will call forth even more as I feel he is possibly holding back/ laid back  As client liked the "experience", I will use this earlier next time and add geography  Even if going slow I feel I sometimes asked 2 questions at a time - ask more precisely  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
