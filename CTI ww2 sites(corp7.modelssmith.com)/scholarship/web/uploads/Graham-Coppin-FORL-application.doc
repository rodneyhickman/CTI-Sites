I AM type: : <b>Humor</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section C:  Why do you want to be a CTI Front of Room Leader? : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1.	Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Before I discovered the Co-Active model there were three modalities I'd found to be personally transformative:  live theater which has the power to provoke and engage and ask an audience to change the way it thinks about the world; yoga which invites the practitioner to hold asana and breathe and notice what's new and what's possible; and psychotherapy which allows a client to engage with the therapist and safely traverse the seas of past and present relationships so that he might heal and move forward into a happier life.    It did not take me long to realise that the Co-Active model was the perfect embodiment of these three modalities for me.  Co-Active Coaching's use of geography and ""taking the client there"" is nothing if not requesting the client to be on the ""stage"" of his life while provoking him with powerful questions so that he makes resonant choices that keep the spotlight of his life shining directly on him; it demands that a client get on her ""mat"" and try new positions and breathe and notice what shows up in service of her growth; it allows for a sacred therapeutic bond between client and coach in which the client shows up in all his human glory where magical co-creative transformation can happen - in short Co-Active is theatre and yoga and therapy in one!    Co-Active Coaching has changed me powerfully and continues to do so in ways that theater and yoga and psychotherapy each did individually.  I would be honored to be a Front of the Room Leader whose own example can show how powerfully transformative Co-Active Coaching is while being part of CTI's mission to bring it to more and more people in a world that needs healing now more than ever.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Every human being can be viewed as a musical instrument waiting to be played, each in her/his unique way, resulting in a gorgeous and lush symphony of Co-Active sound/energy in the world.  I've attended the Core curriculum 16 times (5 as a participant, 11 as an assistant) and 4 Leadership program retreats and have seen how Front of the Room Leaders expertly achieve this in the learning space, indeed how the Level 3 calls them forth to do this.  At first some participants may not know what ""instrument"" they are, some know but aren't sure what sound to make, some are making a sound but would like to integrate it better with the others, some don't even know they are capable of making music!  When I co-led my tribe in Leadership I had the sense often of being a conductor and our job as co-leader/conductors was to get each ""instrument"" singing its truth and purpose into the Level 3.    Moreover it is not enough that we each learn to ""play our instrument"".  It is imperative that we learn to do this in community.  The Co-Active learning space calls us to facilitate this as leaders.    Another metaphor that's effective for me is that at the beginning of each course each participant represents a color waiting to be used to create a magnificent Co-Active painting.  An effective Front of the Room Leader will use all her/his skills to mix the colors and ""paint"" them so that each color is used maximally and expressed and seen vibrantly as an individual component but also as part of the whole.  When I co-led my tribe in Leadership I would often feel like an artist mixing colors and applying them around the space, adding them here and there so that each color in the circle of chairs was used optimally to create a beautiful whole while still keeping its own unique characteristics.    In short, my Level 3 response is that as a Front of the Room Leader I would be called forth to co-create Co-Active art (music, paintings, energy!) that didn't exist in exactly that way before, in service of raising the consciousness of those in the learning space and thus in the world.  This thrills and excites me beyond measure.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>I left the corporate world primarily because I wasn't satisfied with how people were treating each other.  Now that I'm a coach and have seen the power of Co-Active work for myself and my clients, I'm excited about what's possible bringing the Co-Active model to corporations.

Good use of L3 when the firecrackers went off at the beginning.  Coach used it to underline the excitement of the Client's move and the importance of the question he was asking.  Good Powerful Question: ""What's important about this?""  Good use of Fulfillment identifying a client's value around ""doing a good job"".  Good noticing of L3 when the ""You betcha"" didn't land.  Coach noticed a decrease in energy and brought in a good Process Question: ""Where are you now?"" to bring the energy up.  Good Process question:  ""Where do you feel it?""  Good mirroring, Coach identifying where he felt the Client's anxiety.  Good intuition because Client was feeling it in her lungs.  Good articulating what's going on: ""When you think about the situation with your boss ... you lose your breath.""  Good use of Curiosity, Intuition and a little bit of Taking Charge, ""What's it like if you breathe?""  This created a surfacing awareness for the client to realise that ""it's about me doing a good job"" in many areas.  Good Powerful Question:  ""What's available when you connect the dots?""  Good Acknowledgment:  ""You're really in touch with your body.""  This created a surfacing awareness for the client that ""it's about pleasing other people rather than pleasing myself.""  Good Dancing in This Moment and recovery when Coach recognizes the dip in the L3 and asks, ""What's new from when we started"" Good Acknowledgment:  ""You are noticing this everywhere.""  Good Powerful Question, ""What's the cost?""  Good exploring range of voice, ""It's going to be really hard to enjoy your life!""  Good use of Fulfillment Saboteur strategies.  Coach asked Client, ""What do you want to say to Sally Saboteur?""  Good self-management stopping talking when Client started speaking at the same time as Coach began a Request.  Good formatting of request (""Will you ... by when ... how will I know?"")  Good Acknowledgment with a side of Championing at the end.    EXAMPLES OF NOT-SO-GOOD CO-ACTIVE COACHING:  Coach: ""You betcha"".  Not good self-management.  What the Coach knows about Minnesota expressions isn't important.  Coach: ""I feel it in my lungs and heart, where is it, lungs or heart?""  Not good self-management.  Client could have been feeling it anywhere in her chest, not just there.  Better if Coach just said: ""I feel it in my lungs and heart."" There are three examples of where Coach did not listen hard enough and get curious enough when Client said something: 1. Client: ""pleasing other people rather than pleasing myself"" but Coach introduced the Saboteur instead of saying ""Wow.  It's about pleasing other people rather than pleasing yourself.  What's it like to say that Client?""; 2. Client: ""I'm seeing a bigger pattern"" but Coach keeps on framing it in the language of Saboteur instead of asking: ""What's the bigger pattern, Client?""; 3. Client said the cost includes ""a distraction from bigger things"" and Coach talks about what's coming up for him instead of asking: ""What are those bigger things Client?!""  Client said: ""Sally it's time to go away now, you've had a good run"" and laughed.  Coach might have asked, ""what's in the laugh?""  Coach could have made a much more resonant Request, e.g., ""Client, will you come up with 10 Bigger Things that this is distracting you from?""  This would have deepened the learning and forwarded the action a lot more than just meditating on how to get Sally to take a hike.   </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
