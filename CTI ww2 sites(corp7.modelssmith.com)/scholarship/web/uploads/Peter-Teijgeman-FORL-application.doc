Her topic was how to gain confidence for this presentation. At the beginning of the session she was really insecure, afraid that she will be nervous during the presentation and make a fool out of herself.    What was effective Co-Active coaching?  Started by using powerful questions to let the client explore what it means to make a fool out of herself and explore what is important for her about this particular presentation. The client was collapsing the stress of the presentation itself and the stress for the unknown after leaving the company. After articulating this, she was able to distinguish between both, which resulted in more focus on the topic at hand. Intruded with a powerful question about who she wants to be during the presentation. This made her to come up with a role model in a presentation on YouTube. After articulating the calmness that came back in her, we both took the stand of this woman and let her experience the power of it. This turned out to be a perfect structure for her to connect to calmness and confidence. Ended the coaching with championing and a request.    What was not an effective Co-active coaching?  "You gave presentations before, right"; suggestive, closed question, driven from my own agenda... Tada...  The client has a dream for the future, effective Co-active coaching would have been to take her into this future vision to experience and explore. At one point she tells about her captain she has learned to know in a previous session, I could have used this concept more, i.e. getting in touch with the appreciator. Instead of giving two suggestions about the usage of the role model, it would have been more co-active to propose brainstorming ideas in order to get her think about actions by herself. In general some more acknowledgement of the guts to leave the company and start to live her dream would have given her more confidence.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
