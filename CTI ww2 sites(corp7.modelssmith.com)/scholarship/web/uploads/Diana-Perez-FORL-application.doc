Level 1 response: : <br /><b>My background for the past 20 years has been in Human Resources (all areas) working with all levels of people in varying capacities from training, facilitations, consulting, coaching on career development and  change management.  I have done this work for various organizations as an internal HR practioner in the USA, Latin America and Europe.  I now want to do this work external and be with a company whose vision and values I am aligned with and begin to focus on moving my career as an independent consultant with assignments with companies like CTI and as well have assignments on my own. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>Through my own Co-Active Training, I found myself so connected to members in the group with me and they provided me the freedom to be me and they gave me a safe environment to be courageous.  I was changed and I grew as a person and as a leader.  I want to be able to provide this same opportunity on a bigger scale ...and in conjunction with my own individual coaching and consulting work.  I want to be a part of helping world change and support people in their own transformations and to help them live their life at their true potential.    I want to do this globally and to work with people who have the courage to be themselves and to truly live one's life moment to moment, to be bold, to be creative and also to be still and listen.   I want to help facilitate the understanding for people to live a life fulfilled and on purpose through the teachings and the learnings of CTI!  And to promote as well the holistic being for people to balance the co (being) and the active (doing)  and in this way to be of service to the community.  I would also like to focus on women in the Hispanic community who typically have not had the same opportunities as others to actively support them in their transformations!  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

All CTI leaders are required to maintain a practice of at least 10 private clients.   How many coaching clients have you maintained (on average) during 2013? : <br /><b>During 2013 I maintained 2 external clients as I have a corporate HR role now.   In 2012 I had up to 12 clients 9 internal and 3 external this was during Certification.  I had to reduce the number of coaching clients I had this year for the past seven months as I have been in a big transformation of relocation and new job.  I want to start up again a private client practice and prefer to do this outside of a corporate role , however at minimum will pick up more private clients in the corporate role until I have found an opportunity to go on my own.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	How many coaching clients do you have this week? : <br /><b>2 Coaching Clients external from my internal corp. HR role.

When did you begin receiving payment for your professional coaching? : <br /><b>In January 2012 began to receive payments.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6.

What percentage of your coaching practice is corporate focused? : <br /><b>Approximately 90% of my coaching  is corporate focused - this is what I want to change as I want to be an external coach and independent consultanting project. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8.	What experience, if any, do you have coaching relationships, groups, work teams, etc.? : <br /><b>Yes, I have had experience with team coaching through my corporate role.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>9.

CTI may ask you to lead courses inside corporations.  What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>3.

(THANKS)    Overall I believe the coaching demo  displays an effective use of  some of the tools and concepts that I learned in CTI . As yet, the coaching demo could have been more focused on the level 3 listening instead of coming in and out of level 3 into level 2 HR Consulting!   I was using some visualization with the client  i.e. what image do you have in your mind? and getting the client to focus on her body and feelings i.e. How does equal fee?  where is that manifesting in your body? Although I would have wanted to focus on different types of geography to make it even more effective.   I thought it was a good powerful question when I asked the client ""how do you want the conversation to end?"" I was trying to get the client to create a context to come from within her being however, I don't think that was very effective for the client. I believe if I came early on from a coaching principle ie. balance or values the session could have been more effective from a coaching versus consulting basis.  Could have probed more on the fears or anxiety that the client touched  based on by  working on sabatoeur issues.  I was able to have the client forward the action as she felt more tranquil and prepared to face the conversation in the upcoming hours.  As well I felt that I should have been more ""curious"" in my questioning and talked less! However, the conversation ended on a positive reinforcement and acknowledging the client for her being able to have the conversation she wanted to have with acknowledgement on the client's success and the client felt ready to deal with this upcoming situation in a better way.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
