Level 1 response: : <br /><b>Growing my front of the room leading capacity in the co-active way is a powerful and logical path to articulate the impact I want to have in the world. It is a role I recognized and want to play since the beginning of my CTI journey. I think that, if I like this model and its experience so much for myself, then I want to keep learning how to share it with others.    I want to stir and shift perspectives in and out of corporations in France and Asia to promote authenticity, audacity and respond-ability. With time I became a natural bridge between these 2 places (family life and business experience) and I intend to develop this role solidly to support both regions to grow co-actively.      I believe in co-activity as it supports people resourcefulness and creates the conditions for an expansion of the level of consciousness.  In this respect, I see CTI as a large Tribe with which I would like to structure the nature of my relationship to contribute more.    In addition to the thrill and pleasure, being front of the room leader is about supporting me to walk my talk. Doing it with the CTI community of leaders and high standard of professionalism and leadership is instrumental and a real plus which I want to harness.     There is huge learning and wisdom to gather from the tripartite relationship between what I will receive/give from/to the CTI community, the participants and myself as a FORL. This will foster cross-pollination with other initiatives, in my coaching practice, and collaborative projects I am working on.    Importantly, I am confident I will be a powerful CTI FORL.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2.	Level 3 response: : <br /><b>I notice a hunger for transparency and authenticity in the level 3 to simplify relationships and expand collaboration for purposeful living.    From where I sit and what I gather in my 10 years in Asia as a European creating businesses, I realize we are going towards radically new ways to collaborate and work together as human beings to sustain our development.      People are ready, if not to lead, to be invited to lead and have their perspectives shifted in order to act from the inside out to change their environment. I feel a strong hunger to lean-in and talk the We language.      I see the co-active model as an efficient and adaptive model to bridge the "apparent" gap between cultures in a context where radical social and economic shifts have a potential to create businesses where we are leading together, co-create and work on audacious purposes.     Finally, I apply to be a front of the room leader because when my level 3 and my Level 1 meet, I realize how much I want to learn to leverage on the power of "" We"" to facilitate the emergence of models and collective behaviors which support positively human evolution.</b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section D:  Leader Availability : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most of our courses are held on weekends.

What past experiences, if any, (professional and/or personal) do you have to draw upon that you believe make you well-suited to deliver Co-Active training in a corporate/organizational setting? : <br /><b>My business background at management and then leadership roles at an early stage of my career in various company cultures (French, Chinese, Norwegian, and Singaporean) and diverse industries (Hospitality, Distribution, Shipping, Shipbuilding, Oil and Gas, Renewable Energy) helped me to develop agility, business acumen, and ability to develop rapport for partnership in change with individuals and groups.    I have been in charge to lead various teams of different sizes (from 4 to 100 people) in various capacities with more or less success. This allows me to better relate with concerns and contexts of team members and team dynamics.    I have been mostly involved in fast paced organizations and industries where radical change and transition where the norm. Today, I realized it helped me to better understand the concept of interdependence from a system perspective.     Importantly, my taste for challenges coupled with personal history led me to fail many times and develop behaviors, which were not supporting me. This is a tremendous source of learning and wisdom for me;  I experience regularly how it supports the work I do and choices I make with my clients in and out of organizations. </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4.	What else would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy to lead inside organizations? : <br /><b>Thank you for the opportunity.    I offer my candidacy because I am after scalable and sustainable positive impact on society at large and impacting organizations from the inside is a very powerful way to address it.     I offer my candidacy because I want more and more to support my country, France, to access its resourcefulness and creativity, to transform positively and sustainably.     I believe that my immersion in the Chinese culture from a family and professional perspective as well as my French roots help me to develop flexibility, understanding and openness to people and business dynamics in various contexts. This is useful to lead inside organizations in the current context and something I want to leverage on to help creating beautiful businesses.    I trust that companies willing and drawn to co-activity for their development are groups I am looking forward to work with.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section G:  International Coach Federation Credential : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>CTI is an ICF accredited school.

The coach is clearly supporting and seeing him as naturally creative resourceful and whole and yet I can't help but hear a distance, void, between the hunger the client wants to satisfy and some holding back from the coach to stretch to celebrate his client.     With more raw curiosity, intuition, and presence I believe the coach would have been able to generate a richer atmosphere for deeper experience and increase the potential for transformation for his client.    More specifically I think that the coach could have ask his client to express himself more when he mentioned that he wanted to shout and fill the room; as well be more transparent and clear cut on the process coaching bit to go deeper in the U.    This being said, there we can feel a safe and courageous space where the respect of the model and trust between both persons allow for real insights to emerge and actions to be taken.    I long for the coach to bring more of his presence and weight for his client to do the same.  </b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Section J: Agreements : <b></b><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have read and understood the Agreements for CTI FORL.
