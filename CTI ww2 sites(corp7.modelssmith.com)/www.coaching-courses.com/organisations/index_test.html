						<h1 id="main-headline">Corporate Coach Training & Programmes</h1>
                            						
                        <p>CTI has had a significant positive impact on global corporate performance through our Co-Active transformational model. We have trained coaches for over 20 years, a number that recently passed 50,000 coaches and continues to grow exponentially. Many of these coaches practice their craft to the benefit of organisations, either directly or via the clients they serve. In fact, we have provided Co-Active coach training and programming to more than half of the Fortune 100 companies. As many of them are coming to realize, the most valuable resource businesses have is human capital. CTI has a long, proven track record of enhancing that value and its performance, particularly in the UK, as well as in the rest of Europe and the Middle East.</p>
                            
						<h2>Changing Business. Transforming Lives.</h2>
                            

						<p>The most pressing human capital priority facing post-millennial organisations is the ongoing cultivation of workforce talent capable of meeting the business objectives of today and tomorrow. To remain truly competitive regardless of business climate, organisations must adopt a strategy for fundamentally transforming, not simply investing in, human capital.</p>
                            

						<p>As traditional command and control hierarchies give way to flat organisational structures, unlocking the potential of employees at every level becomes a critical factor in organisational relevance and effectiveness. Traditional employee development strategies, while necessary, are no longer sufficient to meet the talent needs of the organisation. To achieve and sustain higher and higher levels of performance, organisations must positively transform how they develop and leverage human capital.</p>

                        <h2>Develop and Lead Your Employees</h2>

						<p>Simply focusing on developing employees' technical or functional expertise is entirely inadequate to create truly sustainable breakthrough performance. The most effective organisations will shift their focus to fundamentally rewiring how people hold themselves and engage with others in the workplace, giving employees the skills and opportunity to recognize and coax the best performance out of themselves and each other.</p>
                            
						<p>By taking a transformative approach to human capital development, organisations will create a workforce that is able to collectively and courageously step forward, set radical expectations and achieve unprecedented outcomes.</p>

                        <p>CTI’s Co-Active coaching model is designed to generate transformation change, an evolution that extends from individuals and into organisations. CTI has played an essential role in changing the thinking and results of the corporate world, through our proliferation of Co-Active principles in a variety of coach training modalities.</p>

						<h2>Partners In Transformation</h2>

                        <p>Through CTI’s coach training programmes, all of which are offered in the UK, we have enabled the business world to have stronger executive leadership, greater team effectiveness, emerging leadership development, and more – by establishing Co-Active cultures,  CTI has provided corporate coaching programmes for many of the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies, many of which are European-based or have significant presence in Europe and the Middle East. Companies we have positively impacted include:</p>

                            <p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>’s organisational coaching services touch on corporations comprehensively, through the following programmes:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                   <strong> Internal Co-Active Coaching:<br/>
                                    Co-Active Coach Training for HR Business Partners &
                                    Co-Active Coach Training for Certified Internal Coaches</strong>
                                    <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> has developed a series of training curricula to help build internal Co-Active Coaching skills inside organisations. Intensive, highly-interactive workshops are complimented by a series of telephone based Learning Labs and one-on-one coaching sessions. This blended approach delivers a comprehensive learning experience to ensure rapid and effective application of new skills to day-to-day activities. Each participant will experience the transformational process of Co-Active Coaching while acquiring the skills to precipitate similar positive change within their clients and colleagues.<br/>
                                    <br/>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Talent Champions</strong><br/>
                                    A training curriculum, rooted in Co-Active coaching techniques, which works to fundamentally reconstruct the relationship between a manager and her team. The manager does not serve as a formal coach, but rather she uses the techniques to help employees see themselves as fully resourceful in meeting the demands of the business. Managers learn to shift modes from command and control to one that enables them to successfully elicit the talent potential inherent in each of her team members.<br/>
                                    <br/>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Relationship Agility</strong><br/>
                                    A dynamic, highly interactive two-day course that teaches managers the Co-Active method of developing workplace relationships that are characterized by a high degree of trust, collaboration and accountability. The focus of the course is squarely on the relationship component of achieving shared goals and objectives. Emphasis is placed on practical experience rather than lecture, and participants will have extensive opportunity for skill practice during the two days.<br/>                                
                                </li>
