										<p>The Coaches Training Institute receives college credit recommendations for training</p>

										<p>SAN RAFAEL, <abbr title="California">C.A.</abbr>/EWORLDWIRE/<abbr title="November">NOV.</abbr> 8, 2005 --- The Coaches Training Institute (<abbr>CTI</abbr>) today announced it has become the first coach training organization to receive college credit recommendations from the nationally recognized American Council on Education (<abbr>ACE</abbr>).</p>

										<p>Based on a July 26, 2005 review by <abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr>'s College Credit Recommendation Service, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s core Co-active&#174; Coaching curriculum, Certification Programme and Co-active&#174; Leadership Programme have been recommended for college credit. A team of content specialists, selected from college faculty, has reported that <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s courses are comparable to college level courses and may be used as transfer credit at many colleges and universities nationwide.</p>

										<p>Founded in 1992, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> was one of the first educational institutions to develop and offer coach training and the first to be accredited by the International Coach Federation (<abbr>ICF</abbr>). Headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> is the largest in-person coach training school in the world and the only to offer both individual and team coaching courses accredited by the International Coach Federation. <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> teaches its ground-breaking Co-active model of coaching in a highly interactive format in public courses and in organisations including <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr>, Marriott, Capgemini, Herman Miller, Boeing, The Walt Disney Company, <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr>, and Fairview Health Systems.</p>

										<p>Recognized as coaching luminaries, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s three co-founders, Laura Whitworth and Karen and Henry Kimsey-House also co-authored the ground-breaking industry bestseller, <cite>Co-active Coaching: New Skills for Coaching People Towards Success in Their Work and Life</cite> with Phil Sandahl.</p>

										<p>The American Council on Education's College Credit Recommendation Service (<abbr>ACE CREDIT</abbr>) has evaluated seven programmes of the <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> courses. For more information, visit <abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr>'s website at www.acenet.edu/acecredit.</p>

										<p><abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr>'s Credit recommendation puts <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> in a select group of organisations which offer <abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr> college credit-recommended courses. Other organisations include the American Management Association, <abbr>AT&#38;T</abbr>, Dale Carnegie Training., Citigroup, Delta Air Lines, Learning Tree International, McDonalds Corporation, Union Pacific Railroad, and <abbr>UAW-GM</abbr>.</p>

										<p><abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr> Credit recommended courses motivate learners to begin, continue or complete a college degree programme. According to a recent <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.</abbr> Department of Education Study, more than 40 percent of American adults take part in some type of adult learning activity each year�the vast majority for work-related reasons or because they want to earn an academic credential. In addition to the potential for college credit, many employers use <abbr title="American Council on Education">ACE</abbr>'s Credit recommendations in determining which training programmes qualify for employee tuition reimbursement.</p>

										<p>For more information on <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> courses, call <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> at 800-691-6008 or 415-451-6000, email <a href="mailto:ctiinfo@thecoaches.com">ctiinfo@thecoaches.com</a>, or visit our website at www.thecoaches.com.</p>
