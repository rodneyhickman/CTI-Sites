									<h2>Henry Kimsey-House, <abbr title="Certified Professional Co-Active Coach">CPCC</abbr>, <abbr title="Master Certified Coach">MCC</abbr>, Co-Founder &amp; Director<!-- | click here for details--></h2>

									<p>One of the first professional coaches in the 1980s, Kimsey-House is the Co-founder and lead designer of the provocative, experiential learning programs
        of CTI and the co-author of <i>Co-Active Coaching</i>, the best-selling industry bible, which will soon be out in its third edition. An actor since age
        nine, Kimsey-House honed his insights into human emotion and the narrative process through classical theatrical training and years of stage, television
        and film experience. With deep conviction that education should be driven by immersive, contextually based learning and not dry information dumps,
        Kimsey-House is committed to creating richly engaging and transformative learning environments where retention approaches 80% rather than the
        traditional 20%. He continues to develop new, innovative curriculum, collaborate with other dynamic thought leaders and is completing a book about
        transformative leadership. He lives with his wife, Karen Kimsey-House, on the coast of northern California.</p>

									<h2>Laura Whitworth, <abbr title="Certified Professional Co-active Coach">CPCC</abbr>, <abbr title="Master Certified Coach">MCC</abbr>, President and Co-Founder</h2>

									

									<p>Laura Whitworth, co-founder of the <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>, passed away in February 2007 after a two year battle with lung cancer. Laura's legacy helped shape the coaching industry with determination, persistence, creativity and compassion. Her numerous accomplishments have touched and changed many lives in profound ways.</p>

									

									<div id="ct-bio3" class="stuff">

										<p>As a Certified Professional coach, Laura nurtured individuals, groups, teams and organisations toward greater productivity and effectiveness. She worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and organisations including Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Pacific Bell and the Oakland Unified School District. In 1997, she was named among the ten most influential coaches by Professional Coach Journal.</p>

										

										<p>In the very early years of the coaching profession, Laura was a founding member of the Personal and Professional Coaches Association, which merged with the International Coach Federation (<abbr>ICF</abbr>). Laura co-founded the Association of Coaching Training Organisations (<abbr>ACTO</abbr>), an organization created to steward high quality coach training and evolve the industry. In 2002, Laura co-founded The Bigger Game Company with Rick Tamlyn, a transformative programme designed to explore new ways for individuals or teams within organisations to lead.</p>

										

										<p>In her spare time, Laura co-authored Co-active Coaching, a best selling book that helped define the field of professional coaching. Laura also led the effort to take the Co-active Coaching model into federal and state prisons where it continues to have a profound impact on the lives of inmates. In 2007, this programme was renamed the Laura Whitworth Prison Project in her honor.</p>

										

										<p>Laura is best described as a fierce warrior and champion of the highest potential for each person she touched. She was bold, courageous, rigorous, incredibly brilliant and disarmingly human. She served this world well and called us all forth, over and over again, asking - demanding - that we reach for the stars. Her passing left a hole in the world of coaching and her presence among us is sorely missed.</p>
