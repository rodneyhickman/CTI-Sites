<p>
Thank you for your interest in assisting with one of our courses. Assisting is a great way to deepen your learning of the course material. Past assistants have told us that they experienced the course information in a whole different way from the back of the room. It's also a great way to get to know our CTI leaders, and a fabulous opportunity to witness our famous Co-active leadership style from the behind the scenes. </p>
<p>
As you assist in a CTI course, it's important that you realize it is both a privilege and a responsibility. We know our courses have a big impact on people and we are committed to delivering a quality learning experience each and every time. </p>
<p>
While there will be certain logistical duties for you as an assistant, the biggest part of your role is who you be. You have the potential to have a huge impact on both the participants and the course leaders. How you conduct yourself has a great deal to do with the success of the course. </p>
<p>
Your job will be to hold the space for learning in the room. This means that you must be alert and aware throughout the entire course - that you be present at Levels 2 & 3 for whatever may be needed to facilitate the learning. While we know you will learn a great deal from assisting, we ask that you commit to service -- being and doing whatever is needed for the course to have the maximum impact for the participants.</p> 
<p>
Since assisting is such a popular experience, please keep in mind that assistant slots often fill three or four months in advance, so sign up early. 
</p>
<p><strong>ASSISTING REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>
In order for everyone to have a positive experience, please read the following requirements and indicate your understanding by checking the box and typing your name in the space provided below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I agree to the following: 
<ul id="bullets">
<li> I understand that my job is to support the leaders and that holding the space for learning in the room is my primary focus.
<li> The course leaders may give me corrective instruction if I am having a negative impact on the participants or the space of the course.  I also understand that the leaders can ask me to leave the course if they feel I am having a negative impact.
<li> I understand that I am making a commitment to be present for a course.  In the event that I need to cancel I will give CTI 14 days notice. Any cancellation less than 14 days notice may impact my eligibility to assist in future courses and be subject to a &pound;35.00 administrative cancellation fee.
<li> I understand that I will be meeting with leaders before and after the course.  On all course days, I will arrive NO LATER than 1 hour prior to the course start time and I will plan on staying 1 hour after the course ends each day. 
<li> I will arrive at the course dressed professionally and ready to work. 
<li> I understand that the learning experience of the course participants is my primary concern and to that end I will be available for assisting duties during breaks and lunch.  
<li> I will not market/solicit my coaching services to course participants either during the course or after the course is complete. Should a participant approach me about becoming their coach or inquire about my coaching business, I can arrange to contact them on another day. 
</ul>

<h2>HOW TO SELECT COURSES FOR ASSISTING</h2>
<p>Use the below drop down menu to select a city and review available courses.  After selecting your courses you will need to type your name, day time phone number, email, and then click Submit Application.  A confirmation email with the times and location of the course will be sent to you within 5 business days.  If  multiple cities are offered, you will need to submit a new application for each location.  If you are planning to stay at the hotel for assisting, please call the hotel to book your room reservation.</p>
<p>Of note, we generally have 3 assistants per course. &nbsp; If the course is full, you will be waitlisted and will be advised by email notification.&nbsp; Since assisting slots frequently fill 3 months in advance, we encourage you to waitlist as we often have last-minute cancellations.</p>
<p>We cannot accommodate requests to assist for specific leaders. We ask that you share our perspective that every CTI course leader will provide you with ample learning opportunities as you assist.</p>


<p>CTI may cancel or reschedule courses at its discretion. CTI will not be responsible for costs that may be incurred by students as a result of such cancellations or rescheduling.</p>


<p>Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and for helping us create great courses!</p>
