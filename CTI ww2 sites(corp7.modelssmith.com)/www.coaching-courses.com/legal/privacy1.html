							<h2>Introduction: Our commitment to your privacy</h2>

							<p>The Coaches Training Institute ('<dfn><abbr>CTI</abbr></dfn>') is highly sensitive to the confidentiality of information provided by you to <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>. As a result, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> has adopted the following Privacy Policy which is applicable to all information that you provide to <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> and which <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> maintains electronically, whether you provide the information through <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s World Wide Web Site (the '<dfn><abbr>Site</abbr></dfn>') or through other means. You should also review our Terms and Conditions of Use as they are also applicable and govern your use of the Site. This Policy does not apply to any information that you may provide to third parties, such as through other sites linked to the <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> Site. You should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective Privacy Policies.</p>

							<p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> expressly reserves in its sole discretion, and at times and intervals of its choosing, the right to change its Policies and Practices periodically in the future without prior notice to Site Users. You should review our Privacy Policy Statement regularly to be sure you are fully current with our practices and procedures in this area. At present, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> uses and discloses the information provided by you for the purposes described below.</p>

							<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

							<p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> may collect information in conjunction with its marketing and registration for programmes and related services and perform follow-up with its programme registrants, as part of the registration process for <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> programmes. In addition, information is collected through the Co-active Network communities and tools. From time to time, we may also conduct surveys or offer contests or other promotional events, and gather additional information from you in connection with those events. Other than in aggregated, derivative form, we do not share such information with anyone outside <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>. Any personal information is kept confidential and used solely by us in accordance with this Policy.</p>

							<h2>What do we use this information for?</h2>

							<p>Primarily, we use your information to provide you with <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> services available to you. We may use your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s Site. Your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> Address may also be used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information, some of which we may aggregate and then share with our partners. We may also use your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address to track information you have seen on our Site. We may use your name, email address and mailing address to assist us in communicating with you.</p>

							<h2>With whom do we share your information?</h2>

							<p>We will not sell, share or rent personal information to others except in accordance with this Policy. We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. Such information is not linked to information that could identify any individual. We partner with third parties to provide specific services. When you sign up for services provided by a third party, we will disclose to the third party only the information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. We may also use outside shipping companies to ship orders and use a credit card processing company to bill members for goods and services. We will disclose to such third parties only the information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</p>

							<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

							<p>Cookies are a standard technology used by commercial web services to store small pieces of information on your hard drive by sending a small string of text to your browser. Cookies make your use of our Site more pleasing and efficient by, for example, 'personalizing' your user interface or identifying which parts of a site you have previously visited. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies unless you have configured yours not to accept them. In order for us to provide you with services, your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration and security. We also use cookies to tailor the information that you receive and for other purposes.</p>

							<h2>Disclaimer of Responsibility for Privacy Policy And Content At Linked Sites</h2>

							<p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s Site may provide you with links to other websites. We are not responsible for those sites and cannot control the use of information that you submit once you reach those sites, nor can we control the content of what is offered on those sites or on links from those sites.</p>

							<h2>Security</h2>

							<abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> takes great precautions to protect our members' personal information. When members submit sensitive information via the Site, the information is protected both online and off-line through information that is encrypted and protected with a widely accepted industry standard encryption protocol - SSL.</p>

							<p>In addition to using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we protect members' information off-line. Access to all of our members' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information that others do not have access to. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure that our members' information is protected.</p>

							<h2>Our Use of Information from Third Parties</h2>

							<p>We may obtain information about you provided to us by third parties such as credit reporting agencies or strategic alliance partners in order to offer you their services and products, to improve our services, or to evaluate your eligibility for our services. However, we will not release personal information about you to them other than in aggregated, derivative form.</p>
