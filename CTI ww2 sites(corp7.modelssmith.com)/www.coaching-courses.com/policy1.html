<h1 id="main-headline">The Coaches Training Institute Policies</h1>



<!-- <p id="intro"></p> -->



<div class="pri">

   
<br /> 
The Coaches Training Institute Policies<br /> 
<b>IN-COURSE CONTACT HOURS</b><br /> 
<br /> 
Co-active Coaching Fundamentals: A 3-day course. In Class Contact Hours: 20 Hours.<br /> 
<br /> 
Fulfillment, Balance, Process, Synergy: Each is a 3-day course. In Class Contact Hours per course:  24 hours.<br /> 
<br /> 
Co-active Certification Programme is a 25-week telecourse of 61 hours.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>PAYMENT AND ENROLLMENT</b><br /> 
<br /> 
You may pay by check, VISA, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Your signature on the Registration Request Form authorizes CTI to automatically charge your credit card. Balances due will be automatically charged 21 days prior to the course date.  All course enrollments are subject to availability. If there is no space in your &#8220;First Choice&#8221; Course(s) you will be placed on a Waiting List for your &#8220;First Choice&#8221; and, subject to availability, enrolled in your &#8220;Second Choice.&#8221;  You will receive written notification of your enrollment status. If neither course is available, we will contact you to discuss other options. Your enrollment in a course is based on the receipt of funds for both the deposit and balance due. Your balance is due 21 days prior to the start of your course. In the process of enrolling you in your requested course(s), CTI will notify you if there are insufficient funds. If we do not hear from you within 48 hours of our notification, your requested space in the course(s) may be released. If enrolled in the Discounted Package and payment has not been received by the start of the course, the discounted package price is forfeited and the full Á la carte course price of $1150 per intermediate course is due.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>BUYER&#8217;S RIGHT TO CANCEL</b><br /> 
<br /> 
You have a right to cancel your enrollment and receive a refund by delivering a <b>written notice</b> to: The Coaches Training Institute, 4000 Civic Center Drive, Suite 500, San Rafael, CA 94903.  You do not have the right to cancel by telephoning or e-mailing the school, or by not attending a course you are registered for.<br /> 
<br /> 
<!-- If you are a Colorado student, please see the Colorado School Catalog and Enrollment Agreement. If you are a Minnesota student, please see the Minnesota Student Buyer&#8217;s Right to Cancel.<br /> -->
<br /> 
<b>RIGHT OF REFUSAL</b><br /> 
<br /> 
CTI reserves the right to refuse a student participation in courses and/or programmes.  In addition, upon the recommendation of both CTI Course Leaders, CTI reserves the right to remove from a classroom a student who is negatively impacting other students and/or the learning environment.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>REFUND POLICIES</b><br /> 
<br /> 
General Information Regarding Pricing, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds: If you choose to cancel your enrollment in a course, and if it is 21 or more days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of the course, you will receive a full refund, including the $50 non-refundable registration fee. Written notifications to cancel a course received must be postmarked 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the course start date. If you cancel less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of a course, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 non-refundable registration fee.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Discounted Package Withdrawal:</b> If you withdraw from a discounted programme package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The $50 non-refundable registration fee will be applied if written notice is received less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the next course date. The full individual course fee is $725 for Fundamentals, and $1150 each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.  <br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Individual Course Withdrawal:</b>  If you withdraw from an individual course after the course has already begun, you will receive a pro rated refund—minus the $50 non-refundable registration fee—based on time completed in the course.  If the course materials are returned in their original condition within 30 days of the date of cancellation, you will also receive a refund for the cost of the materials.   For example, if you attend the Fundamentals Course, retain the course materials, and cancel 12 hours into the course:  $725 (Fundamentals Tuition) - $50 (non-refundable Registration Fee) - $50 (Materials Fee) = $625 (Course Fee less Registration Fee & Materials)  $625 divided by 20 (Total Fundamentals classroom hours) = $31.25 (Amount per classroom hour) x 8 (Classroom hours not attended) = $250.00 Student Refund Amount   (Add $50 to refund amount if materials are returned in original condition within 30 days of cancellation date.)<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Transfer Fees:</b> You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification), are assessed a <b>USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</b>. Certification programme transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Notice of Cancellation/Withdrawal and Refunds:</b> Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation/withdrawal is postmarked, or if hand-delivered, the date delivered to the school.  Refunds will be made within 30 days following the receipt of written requests.<br /> 
------<br /> 
<b>For California <!-- and Colorado --> Residents Only</b>: The Coaches Training Institute is licensed with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education, State of California. <!--, and the Colorado Department of Higher Education, Private Occupational School Board. -->  Licensing means we have met certain minimum standards imposed by the state for licensed schools on the basis of our written application to the state.  You will receive an enrollment agreement that details the full refund and programme policies for your state.<br /> 
---------<br /> 
<b>For Minnesota Residents Only:</b> General Information Regarding Pricing, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds:  Each student will be notified of acceptance/rejection in writing.  In the event a student is rejected, all tuition, fees and other charges shall be refunded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a student gives written notice of cancellation within five business days of the execution of the contract (for schools using written contracts) or day on which the student is accepted (for schools not using written contracts), then a complete refund is given regardless of whether the programme has started.  If a student gives written notice of cancellation after five business days of the execution of the contract (for schools using written contracts) or day on which the student is accepted (for schools not using written contracts), but before the first lesson has been serviced by the school, then all tuition, fees and other charges, except 15 percent of the total cost of the programme (15 percent not to exceed $50.00) shall be refunded to the student. If a student gives written notice of cancellation after the first lesson is completed,  but before completion of 75 percent of the period of instruction, then the student is assessed a pro rata portion of tuition, fees and all other charges based on the number of days in the term plus 25 percent of the total programme cost (25 percent not to exceed $75.00) Any notice of cancellation shall be acknowledged in writing within 10 business days of receipt of such notice and all refunds shall be forwarded to the student within 30 business days of receipt of such notice. This refund policy is not linked to any student conduct policy and any promissory instrument shall not be negotiated prior to the completion of 50 percent of the course.<br /> 
<br /> 
Notice of Cancellation/Withdrawal and Refunds: Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation is postmarked or, in the case where the notice is hand carried, it shall occur on the date the notice is delivered to the school.  The date of execution of the enrollment agreement shall be presumed to be the date of delivery of the notice of acceptance; and if delivered by mail, the postmark date of the letter of acceptance.<br /> 
<br /> 
Discounted Package Withdrawal Pricing: If you withdraw from a discounted programme package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The full individual course fee is $725 for Fundamentals; $1150 each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy; and $4400 for Certification. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.  <br /> 
<br /> 
Individual Course Withdrawals Programmes not exceeding forty (40) hours in length shall be subject to the regular refund policies herein, except that once such a programme has commenced the refund shall be prorated, based on the hours of the programme as stated in the school catalog or advertisements and the number of hours attended by the student.<br /> 
<br /> 
Transfer Fees: You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification), are assessed a <b>USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</b>. Certification programme transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.<br />
