=============================================================<br /> 

<b>Post Fundamentals </b><br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Session One Recommended Topic:  Designed Alliance and the Wheel of Life</b><br /> 
<br /> 
What is the alliance that you and your mentor coach want to design?  You can use this as an opportunity to begin designing an alliance.  It&#8217;s important to note that a Designed Alliance is a process, not an event.  In all relationships, including coaching relationships, the design of the alliance is ongoing.  Whenever a new relationship begins&#8212;and most particularly whenever there is challenge, confusion or difficulty&#8212;there is an opportunity to design or to continue the design of the alliance.  <br /> 
<br /> 
As you practice this both with clients and in your life, you&#8217;ll notice that your relationships will become clearer, more honest and more grounded.  <br /> 
<br /> 
<b>For the Client</b><br /> 
Score your Wheel of Life with your coach.  Where are you out of balance in your life?  What specific action or actions will you take to raise the score in a particular area?  Don&#8217;t forget to have your mentor coach hold you accountable!<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>For the Coach</b><br /> 
The Wheel of Life is a great place to begin coaching with a client.  It provides a clear snapshot of a client&#8217;s life and LOTS of opportunities for coaching.  <br /> 
<br /> 
Recommended homework between calls:  <br /> 
<br /> 
<li>Pay attention to Designed Alliances in your life and practice designing an alliance at least twice.<br /> 
</li><li>Take action to create more balance in at least one area on your Wheel of Life.<br /> 
</li><br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Session Two Recommended Topic:  Practice Clients and Accountability</b><br /> 
<br /> 
On the Call Part One: De-brief homework from last call: <br /> 
<li>What did you learn about Designed Alliance?<br /> 
</li><li>What actions did you take around your Wheel of Life?  <br /> 
</li><br /> 
<b>For the Client</b><br /> 
On The Call Part Two:  We strongly recommend that you find several practice clients to coach while you are taking classes with CTI.  If you are clear that you want to become a professional coach, you&#8217;ll want to begin building your coaching practice as soon as possible.<br /> 
<br /> 
As such, there are so MANY different ways to apply Co-Active Coaching® skills. Regardless of how you plan to use what you are learning, it will be helpful to set up a few coaching clients to practice your skills.  You will LEARN so much when you practice and then apply what you learn in your classes.  If you really want to get your money&#8217;s worth from the CTI curriculum, having even a few practice clients is the way to go.  <br /> 
<br /> 
On this call, talk with your mentor coach about finding practice clients.  Who might you invite?  What would be the best way to set it up?  <br /> 
<br /> 
What is the accountability you would like your mentor coach to hold for you?<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>For the Coach</b><br /> 
Remember, Accountability is not about making people do something.  Instead, it is about holding what the client SAID they would do, cleanly and without judgment.  Accountability supports clear action and assists the client in being grounded about where they are truly committed.  <br /> 
<br /> 
Recommend homework in between calls:  <br /> 
<br /> 
<li>Add at least 2 clients.  The structure can be whatever works for you.  They can be paying clients or practice clients, whatever will serve you best. (If your client has only taken Fundamentals and has not yet signed up for or taken Fulfillment, recommend that they practice the skills they have learned with at least two people and if they want clients, to have practice clients only.)
 <br /> 
</li><li>Notice where in your life you need to practice the skill of Accountability.  Who in your life do you need to hold accountable and for what?  <br /> 
</li><br />

<br /> 
<b>For the Client</b><br /> 
With your coach, design at least one action step you can take to begin honoring your values more fully.  What is the one action that, if you took it, would change your life completely?<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>For the Coach</b><br /> 
As clients begin to respect and honor their values, they move to a place of deeper authenticity and resonance in their lives.  So, the values clarification process is just the beginning of walking a client towards the resonance of Fulfillment.<br />

</li><br /> 
On the call Part Two:<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>For the Client</b><br /> 
In your Balance course, one of the important things you learned was that we have a choice in the perspective through which we view any particular circumstances or set of circumstances.  The ability to be fluid and adopt the perspective that is most useful for us is one of life&#8217;s greatest skills.<br /> 
<br /> 
On this call, work with your mentor coach about a situation in which you feel stuck.  Encourage your mentor coach to use the Balance Formula.  What is the topic?  What are the other perspectives?  Which one do you choose?<br />

</li><br /> 
<b>For the Client</b><br /> 
In your Process course, you explored your Life Purpose and worked on creating a life purpose statement.  While it&#8217;s useful to have a resonant metaphor for your life purpose, what&#8217;s most important is whether you are living your life according to your purpose.  In this way, your life purpose informs the direction and flow of the whole your life.  <br /> 
<br /> 
Talk with your mentor coach about being &#8216;on&#8217; or &#8216;off&#8217; purpose in your life.  Is the general flow of your life rooted in your life purpose or is your river off course in some places?<br />
