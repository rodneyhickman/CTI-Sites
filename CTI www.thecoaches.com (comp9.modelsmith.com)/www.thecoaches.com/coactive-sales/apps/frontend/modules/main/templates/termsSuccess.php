<h1>Co-Active&reg; Entrepreneur Sales Program Foundation</h1>
<p><strong>Instructions: By agreeing to this document you agree to keep the following foundation for your participation in the Co-Active&reg; Entrepreneur Sales Program. Please agree to this Foundation Agreement seven (7) business days prior to your first webinar. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I agree to be on time to each and every session and will come to each meeting prepared with all necessary documentation for participation in the group.</p>
<p>2. I agree to make weekly written commitments to building my coaching practice that are specific, measurable, actionable and ambitious. I fully intend to keep the commitments I make. I understand that the commitments I make are my own, that I will take full responsibility of them, and will complete each regardless of obstacles I may encounter.</p>
<p>3. I agree while in the program to spend 60% of my practice building time on &ldquo;Productive Time&rdquo; prospecting methods. Productive Time prospecting is voice to voice, person to person asking for sample sessions, talking about coaching asking prospective clients to become clients or asking for referrals. It is not creating marketing material or leaving messages.</p>
<p>4. I agree to bring my most authentic self to all of the group calls. I agree to interact with myself and others as naturally creative, resourceful and whole. What that does not mean is I come unconsciously whining, complaining and resisting. I will participate to the fullest extent and will know at all times that these meetings are designed to aid me in overcoming obstacles to my success.</p>
<p>5. I agree that all comments and events that occur in this Co-Active&reg; Entrepreneur Selling Program will be held as confidential.</p>
<p>6. I agree to be held accountable.</p>
<p>7. I agree that the facilitator(s) shall direct the group towards accountability and has the option to re-focus the conversation.</p>
<p>8. I agree to not miss any webinars, and to attend all accountability groups, knowing I cannot miss more than two accountability groups and stay in the program.&nbsp; I will book these meetings into my schedule upon signing this foundation, and will not let external circumstances distract me from this commitment.</p>
<p>9. I agree to HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>
