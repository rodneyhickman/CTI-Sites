Marketing Calendar
==================

Purpose:
Allow marketing (Jill Schichter and Marcia Norris) to see North American courses and events from FileMaker in a unified online calendar. 

Description:
Events are pulled from FileMaker once a day via a cronjob. The events are filtered so that only North American events are stored in a Mysql database. The calendar is displayed using a PHP calendar class from Klovera: http://www.klovera.com/php-calendar-class/

Technical Description:

The Marketing Calendar is written in PHP, using Symfony 1.2.4 framework. See http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/book/1_2

The ORM is Propel 1.3.0. See http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/book/1_2/en/08-Inside-the-Model-Layer

Please note that in Propel, each model is represented by a model and a peer. The peer is similar to a "Collection of Models" in other ORMs. 

The schema is specified in config/schema.yml
