**Not just a widget**, if your theme does not support widgets, you can use this calendar by calling its **function**:

`archive_calendar();`

you can also configure it:
$defaults = array(
    'next_text' => '˃',
    'prev_text' => '˂',
    'post_count' => true,
    'month_view' => true,
    'month_select' => 'default',
    'different_theme' => 0, // set 1 (true) if you want to set a different theme for this widget
    'theme' => null, // theme 'name' if 'different_theme' == true
    'categories' => null, // array() -> list of categories to show
    'post_type' => null // array() -> list of post types to show
);
archive_calendar($args);`

**next_text:** text showing on the next year button, can be empty or HTML to use with Font Awesome for example.

**prev_text:** just like `next_text` but for previous year button.

**post_count:** `true` to show the number of posts for each month, `false` to hide it. If you hide post count with CSS, set to false to avoid counting posts uselessly.

**month_view:** `true` to show months instead of years archives, false by default.

**month_select:** `default` shows the last month available with at least one post. Also `prev`, `next` or `current`.

**SHORTCODE SUPPORT**
Use the shortcode to show Archives Calendar in the text widget or in a page:
`[arcalendar next_text=>'>' prev_text=>'<' post_count=>"true" month_view=>"true" "categories"=>"category1, category2", post_type=>"post, forum"]`

*In some cases the support of shortcodes in the text widget has to be activated in the plugin settings*
