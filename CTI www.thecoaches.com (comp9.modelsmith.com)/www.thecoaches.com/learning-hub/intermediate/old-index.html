                        <h2>Core Curriculum Courses</h2>
                        <p>The following intermediate courses are three full days and must be taken in order.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Fulfillment</strong><br />
                            Coaching clients in the area of Fulfillment is about having them let go of preconceived rules and limitations, and step into creating lives that are centered in what truly brings them alive.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Fulfillment Course you learn to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use inner journeys and imagery to help clients define a vision of the future they will create.</li>
                                <li>Assist clients in identifying their unique values and assessing their satisfaction with living those values.</li>
                                <li>Identify self-defeating influences.</li>
                                <li>Begin creating the relationship with a new client.</li>
                                <li>Design an initial Discovery Session.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Balance</strong><br />
                            We live our lives in constant motion. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that we have a choice in what we do. Balance coaching is about guiding your clients to make powerful life choices, and to select the experiences they want most, rather than dashing about trying to have it all.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this course, you will learn to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have your clients look at any situation from a number of perspectives.</li>
                                <li>Coach clients to make choices including choosing one perspective from the ones</li>
                                <li>they&rsquo;ve explored.</li>
                                <li>Have clients come up with an alive plan for action that arises out of the perspective</li>
                                <li>they&rsquo;ve chosen.</li>
                                <li>Bring clients to the place of commitment.</li>
                                <li>Use structures to keep clients in action.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Process</strong><br />
                            Process coaching is about supporting clients in being present with what they are experiencing in the flowing river of their lives. Although sometimes uncomfortable, a clients&rsquo; emotional experience is important. What we are experiencing in the moment provides important energy and momentum. Witnessing and holding clients in their messy, sometimes confusing experience allows them to feel known. And in that mirror, to more fully know themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the course, you will learn how to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Work with clients around emotionally charged issues.</li>
                                <li>Develop your own capacity to remain present in challenging situations.</li>
                                <li>Use process coaching skills to have clients in the experience of the moment rather than talking about what they are experiencing.</li>
                                <li>Integrate the three principles of Co-active Coaching.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Synergy</strong><br />
                            Co-active&reg; Coaching is not about applying techniques from some external static &ldquo;rule book.&rdquo; Rather the Co-active Coach generates what is most needed in each moment. Synergy focuses on getting the Co-active Coaching model in your body and takes your coaching to a higher level of impact and professionalism.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Access a wider range of our voice and body for greater impact in your coaching.</li>
                                <li>Create in the moment, rather from pre-conceived rules.</li>
                                <li>Utilize the power of story in your coaching.</li>
                                <li>Incorporate you own creativity and ability with the cornerstones, contexts and skills of the Co-active Coaching model.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Program Hours for the Intermediate Courses</h2>
