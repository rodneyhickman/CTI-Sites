                        <h1>SYNERGY COURSE WORK</h1>

                        <p class="navycaps">Synergy IS ABOUT BRINGING YOUR COACHING TO A NEW LEVEL OF FLUIDITY AND PROFESSIONALISM.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> IN THIS COURSE, YOU WILL integrate all you have learned so that your coaching is direct, potent and impactful. You will also learn to respond fluidly and use all of yourself to create in the moment rather than employing specific, rule-bound approaches.</p>


                        <hr class="lightdouble" />





                        <p>A Co-Active&reg; Coach creates in the moment, uses intuition, and dances with the client. Co-Active&reg; Coaching is not about applying techniques from some external, static &ldquo;rule book.&rdquo; The Synergy course focuses on integrating what you have learned in previous courses and takes your coaching to a higher level of impact and professionalism.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Access a wider range of our voice and body for greater impact in your coaching.</li>
                            <li>Create in the moment, rather from pre-conceived rules.</li>
                            <li>Utilize the power of story in your coaching.</li>
                            <li>Incorporate you own creativity and ability with the cornerstones, contexts and skills of the Co-Active&reg; Coaching model.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>If you have time before your course, browse through the <strong>Resources</strong> area looking at the <strong><em>Topics</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tools</em></strong>.<br /> (The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.)</p>
                        <p><br /> If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


                        <a name="before"></a>

                        <h2>During your course</h2>
                        <p>Be willing to follow your instincts rather than your knowledge and be willing to fail.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Set up a client for your practice coaching session on the evening of Day Two of your course.<br /> <br /> Arrange your life so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your three days.<br /> <br /> Do your homework.</p>


                        <a name="before"></a>

                        <h2>After your course</h2>
                        <p>Developing coaching skill is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice and sustain your new skills after your Synergy course:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Continue to enroll clients into your coaching practice. (You will need five clients by the time you are in your third week of the Certification Program)</li>
                            <li>While thinking about your existing clients, answer the following questions:</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>How will you use your full range with this client?</li>
                                <li>Where have you been holding back?</li>
                                <li>What is the next place of authenticity with this client?</li>
                                <li>How will you deepen the connection and safety with each client?</li>
                                <li>How alive has the coaching been? How alive and engaged is the client?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>Use the coaching aids in the <strong><em>Topics</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tools</em></strong> areas of the <strong>Resources</strong> section to help you tap into the three principles of Co-Active Coaching and add variety to your sessions.</li>

                        </ol>
