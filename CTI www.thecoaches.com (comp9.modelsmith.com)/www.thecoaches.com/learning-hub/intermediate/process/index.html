                        <p class="redcaps">Please note:&nbsp; Use of CTI Intellectual Property.&nbsp; CTI students may use materials presented during their course work, including materials on CTI&rsquo;s Learning Hub, in their work with their coaching clients only.&nbsp; Any use of CTI Intellectual Property beyond one-to-one coaching is not allowed without the specific written approval of CTI.</p>

                        <p>Process coaching is about being with clients wherever they are on the flowing river of their lives. Although uncomfortable, a client&rsquo;s mess, chaos, and confusion are part of his or her forward motion. Being with clients in both their messy and ecstatic places allows them to feel known, and in that mirror, to more fully know themselves.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            &raquo; Work with clients around emotionally charged issues.
                            <br />
                            &raquo; Develop your own capacity to remain present in challenging situations.
                            <br />
                            &raquo; Use process coaching skills to have clients in the experience of the moment rather than talking about what they are experiencing.
                            <br />
                            &raquo; Integrate the three principles of Co-Active Coaching.</p>

                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>If you have time before your course, browse through the <a href="/learning-hub/intermediate/process/resources.html">Resources</a> area looking at the <strong><em>Topics</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tools</em></strong>. The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.</p>
                        <p>If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            &raquo;
                            <strong>Begin asking your clients to be present</strong> with what they are experiencing in the moment.
