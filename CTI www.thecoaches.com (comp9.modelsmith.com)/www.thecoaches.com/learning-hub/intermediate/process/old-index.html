                        <p class="redcaps">PROCESS COACHING IS ABOUT BEING PRESENT AND GROUNDED IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OR STATE OF MIND.<br /> <br /> THE CORE SKILL OF PROCESS COACHING IS TO EXPAND YOUR POWER OF BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT DESPITE FORCES THAT MAY TRY TO SWAY YOU SUCH AS STRONG EMOTION, DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE, CONFUSION, ETC...</p>


                        <hr class="lightdouble" />




                        <p>Process coaching is about being with clients wherever they are on the flowing river of their lives. Although uncomfortable, a client&rsquo;s mess, chaos, and confusion are part of his or her forward motion. Being with clients in both their messy and ecstatic places allows them to feel known, and in that mirror, to more fully know themselves.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Work with clients around emotionally charged issues.</li>
                                <li>Develop your own capacity to remain present in challenging situations.</li>
                                <li>Use process coaching skills to have clients in the experience of the moment rather than talking about what they are experiencing.</li>
                                <li>Integrate the three principles of Co-active Coaching.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>


                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>If you have time before your course, browse through the <strong>Resources</strong> area looking at the <strong><em>Topics</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tools</em></strong>.<br /> (The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.)</p>
                        <p><br /> If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>During your course</h2>
                        <p>Be willing to be with your own discomfort to stay present with your client even in emotionally charged or difficult situations.<br /> <br /> Set up a client for your practice coaching session on the evening of Day Two of your course.<br /> <br /> Arrange your life so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your three days.<br /> <br /> Do your homework.</p>

                            Developing coaching skill is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice and sustain your new skills before your Synergy course:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Enlist two more people to become your practice clients. Charge them a nominal fee. Tell them you are in training to become a professional coach. Meet with them once a week for half an hour by telephone.</li>
                                <li>Continue to expand your emotional vocabulary.</li>
                                <li>Begin asking your clients to be present with what they are experiencing in the moment.</li>
                                <li>Follow the Process Energy Pattern with at least one client.</li>
                            </ol>
