                        <p class="greencaps">BALANCE COACHING IS ABOUT POWERFUL CHOICES AND INTENTIONAL ACTION.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> THE CORE SKILL OF BALANCE COACHING IS THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND CHOOSE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS COMMITMENT TO ACTION.</p>


                        <hr class="lightdouble" />



                        <p>We live our lives in constant motion. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that we have choice in what we do. Balance coaching is about guiding your clients to make powerful life choices, and to select the experiences they want most, rather than dashing about trying to have it all. <em>Balance coaching results in action that is alive, effective and empowered.</em></p>
                        <p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have your clients look at any situation from a number of perspectives.</li>
                                <li>Coach clients to make choices including choosing one perspective from the ones they&rsquo;ve explored.</li>
                                <li>Have clients come up with an exciting, life-affirming strategy for action that arises out of the perspective they&rsquo;ve chosen and resonant choice.</li>
                                <li>Bring clients to the place of commitment.</li>
                                <li>Use structures to keep clients in action.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>If you have time before your course, browse through the <strong>Resources</strong> area looking at the <strong><em>Topics</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tools</em></strong>.<br /> &nbsp;(The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.)</p>
                        <p>If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.&nbsp;</p>

                        <a name="during"></a>
                        <h2>During your course</h2>
                        <p>Notice the different perspectives all around you. Be willing to try on perspectives that seem uncomfortable or foreign to you.<br /> <br /> Set up a client for your practice coaching session on the evening of Day Two of your course.<br /> <br /> Arrange your life so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your three days.<br /> <br /> Do your homework.</p>

                        <h2>After your course</h2>
                        <p>Developing coaching skills is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice and sustain your new skills before your Process course:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tell people that you have an assignment to practice Balance coaching. Ask them to do sample sessions with you and practice Balance coaching with them.</li>
                                <li>Use these practice sessions to enroll a few new clients. Choose the number of clients that is right for you.</li>
                                <li>Charge your clients the amount of money that feels right to you. Let them know you are in training to become a professional coach. Meet with them three to four times per month for a specific amount of time.</li>
                                <li>Review the suggested structures for keeping clients in action. Work with your clients to develop structures that keep them in action.</li>
                                <li>Work with the Balance Formula until you are familiar with each step. For example, spend one day listening for perspectives, spend another day brainstorming new perspectives, listen for perspectives in everyday conversation, etc...&nbsp;</li>
                            </ol>
