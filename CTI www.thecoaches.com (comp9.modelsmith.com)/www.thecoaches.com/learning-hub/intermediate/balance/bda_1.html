                                &raquo; <strong>Charge your clients the amount of money that feels right to you.</strong> Let them know you are in training to become a professional coach. Meet with them three to four times per month for a specific amount of time.<br />
                                &raquo; <strong>Review the suggested structures for keeping clients in action.</strong> Work with your clients to develop structures that keep them in action.
