YOU WILL LEARN TO HELP CLIENTS TO LET GO OF PRECONCEIVED RULES AND LIMITATIONS AND TO STEP INTO WHAT TRULY BRINGS THEM ALIVE.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> THE CORE SKILL OF FULFILLMENT COACHING IS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR (AND YOUR CLIENT&rsquo;S) INNER WISDOM. IN THIS COURSE, YOU WILL DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WISE INTERNAL VOICE AND LEARN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT VOICE AND YOUR SABOTEUR.</p>


                        <hr class="lightdouble" />


                        <p>At the end of the course, you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <br />
                            &raquo; Assist clients in identifying their unique values and assessing their satisfaction with living those values.

                            <br />
                            &raquo; Begin creating the relationship with a new client.
                            <br />
                            &raquo; Conduct an initial Discovery Session.

                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>Before your course, browse through this website and get familiar with the material. Pay special attention to the areas listed below. The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.</p>
                        <p>Click on the <a href="intermediate/fulfillment/resources.html">Resources</a> link and review the <strong><em>Business Resources</em></strong> area, also review the <em>Discovery Session Checklist</em> and <em>Discovery Session Template</em> in the <strong><em>Tools</em></strong> area. This is in preparation for creating a rough draft of your own Discovery Session. Please make notes of your questions and any items you may want to include in your rough draft and bring your notes to the course.</p>
                        <p>If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.</p>

                            Set up a client for your practice coaching session on the evening of Day Two of your course.<br /> <br />
