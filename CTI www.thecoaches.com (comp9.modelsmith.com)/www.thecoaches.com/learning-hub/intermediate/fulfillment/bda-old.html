                        <h1>FULFILLMENT COURSEWORK</h1>

                        <p class="orangecaps">FULFILLMENT COACHING IS ABOUT ALIVENESS. YOU WILL LEARN TO HELP CLIENTS TO LET GO OF PRECONCEIVED RULES AND LIMITATIONS AND TO STEP INTO WHAT TRULY BRINGS THEM ALIVE.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> THE CORE SKILL OF FULFILLMENT COACHING IS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR (AND YOUR CLIENT&rsquo;S) INNER WISDOM. IN THIS COURSE, YOU WILL DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WISE INTERNAL VOICE AND LEARN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT VOICE AND YOUR SABOTEUR.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> IN THIS COURSE, YOU WILL DEVELOP SKILLS FOR HELPING CLIENTS DISCOVER THEIR UNIQUE VALUES, IDENTIFY SELF-DEFEATING INFLUENCES, AND CREATE THEIR OWN VISION FOR A COMPELLING FUTURE.</p>

                        <h2>Before your course</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;If you have time before your course, browse through this website and get familiar with the material.&nbsp;Pay special attention to the areas listed in the Pre-course Preparation below.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pre-course Preparation </strong>&nbsp;(The preparation may be done during the course if you will have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course.)</p>
                        <p>Click on the<em></em><strong>Resources</strong><em> </em>link and review the <strong><em>Business Resources</em></strong> area, also review the <em>Discovery Session Checklist</em> and <em>Discovery Session Template</em> in the <strong><em>Tools</em></strong> area. This is in preparation for creating a rough draft of your own Discovery Session. <br /> Please make notes of your questions and any items you may want to include in your rough draft and bring your notes to the course.</p>
                        <p>If for any reason you are unable to complete the preparation and won&rsquo;t have access to the Learning Hub in the evenings of Day One or Day Two of the course, please plan to do the reading shortly after course completion.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>During your course</h2>
                        <p>Be willing to quiet your mind to be open to the whisper of your own deep internal wisdom and also to distinguish and confront the voice of your Saboteur.<br /> <br /> Set up a client for you(r) practice coaching session on the evening of Day 2 of your course.<br /> <br /> Arrange your life so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your 3 days.<br /> <br /> Do your homework.</p>

                        <h2>After your course</h2>
                        <p>Developing coaching skill is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice before your Balance course:<br /> <br /> 1. Choose five Powerful Questions from the examples in the&nbsp;<strong><em>Tools</em></strong>&nbsp;section of the Learning Hub and practice using them with your clients this week.<br /> <br /> 2. Enlist four people to become your practice clients. Charge them a nominal fee. Tell them you are in training to become a professional coach. Meet with them once a week for half an hour by telephone.<br /> <br /> 3. Practice your Discovery Session on two people and get feedback. What did they learn about themselves from this process? What do they recommend you keep in the Discovery Session? What would they cut from it? What would they add?<br /> <br /> 4. Use the <em>Captain &amp; Crew Chart</em> from the <strong><em>Tools</em></strong> section with at least two clients.</p>
