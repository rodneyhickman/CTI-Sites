	<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">NEW: Language Changes</span></p>
<p><strong>Components of the Co-Active Energy Pattern</strong></p>
<p>In earlier Process courses, there were several key terms emphasized that we are no longer using: Up the Tube, Down the Tube, Take Them Somewhere, and Take Them Where They Are. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Up the Tube/Down the Tube&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Though this has been a relatively effective means of communicating the varying qualities of e-motion in our clients, it has also created unnecessary expectations of what a client's experience should be as well as what the coach's intention should be. &nbsp;<strong>Up</strong> tends to be seen as <em>good</em> or <em>positive</em>, whereas <strong>Down</strong> tends to be seen as <em>bad</em> or <em>negative</em> - no matter how much we say that isn't so! &nbsp;In some situations it can create a dramatization or forcing of emotions that is unnecessary and ineffective. &nbsp;In the new course design, the emphasis is on simply being present with all that is within the client, inviting them to experience it fully, so that new energy and emotion will become available to the client to create from as they stop resisting what is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Take them Somewhere vs. Take them Where They Are</strong></p>
<p>In earlier Process courses, we taught the distinction between <em>Take them Somewhere</em> Geography vs. <em>Take them Where They Are </em>Geography. &nbsp;Geography is an important element in ALL co-active coaching. &nbsp; Our bodies are a rich resource which enables us to access different information as we move and shift it. &nbsp;We've taken the emphasis off of specific postures and are now tuning into the subtleties of the role our bodies play in accessing the energies within us that are ripe for change. &nbsp;It's important for the coach to be aware of that impact and create from it in order to evoke transformation. &nbsp;Some postures, tones of voice, and other physical nuances will move a client forward, while others will take them more deeply into this moment. &nbsp;Like a skilled musician who is constantly tuning their instrument as the music or weather changes, so must the coach stay present to the geography in every coaching interaction and adjust accordingly. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
