    <h1>THE CAPTAIN AND CREW</h1>

<p>In our new curriculum, the Captain and Crew Model replaces the concept of Future Self.</p>
<p>Our clients have the innate desire to live a fulfilling life: a life that is both aligned with their values and true to their life purpose. Though the voices of the Saboteur can be very disempowering, the client also has inner resources that are very empowering. The Captain and Crew is a metaphor for those resources within which are there to serve our clients in living that fulfilling life.</p>

<a name="Captain"></a>
<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">What&rsquo;s New: The Captain</span></p>
<p>Your Captain is your inner leader, that part inside of you that is clear and knowing. He or she is always in command and leads all parts of yourself towards the fullest expression of your Life Purpose. Your Captain knows that your life is as it should be in this moment and at the same time holds the paradox of wanting more for you. This part of you knows your strengths, talents, gifts and your limitations and has room for all of you. Your Captain believes in you completely and no matter what, he or she holds you tenderly with gentleness, compassion and infinite patience. Your Captain has always been there waiting to meet you and is always available.</p>
<p>Key attributes of the Captain:</p>
<p>&raquo; <strong>Wisdom</strong><br />
  &raquo; <strong>Compassion</strong><br />
  &raquo; <strong>Courage</strong><br />
  &raquo; <strong>Certainty and Clarity</strong></p>
<a name="Crew"></a>
<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">What&rsquo;s New: The Crew</span></p>
<p>The Crew is a dynamic group of inner resources that support the Captain in helping you (the client) lead a dynamic, values-based, purposeful life. Just as the Saboteur can take many forms, so can these supportive members of the Crew. We&rsquo;ve provided a Captain and Crew Map to get you started with some possible crew members. We invite you to use your imagination and resourcefulness to create your own empowering crew.</p>

<a name="Appreciator"></a>
<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">What&rsquo;s New: The Appreciator</span></p>
<p>The Appreciator is a free agent and moves easily into all domains of the Captain and Crew Map. He or she is able to appreciate everything that happens and can find value in anything. The Appreciator does not know how to judge. He or she understands that life is unfolding exactly as it should and appreciates the gift in everything.</p>
<a name="Map"></a>

<a name="Questions"></a>
<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">What&rsquo;s New: Crew Interview Questions</span></p>
<p>Use the following questions to build your relationship with two Crew members. You can pick two Crew members from the Captain and Crew map or create your own.</p>
<p>Ask each crew member the following questions:</p>
	<p>1. What is your job description?<br />
	  2. What do you love about your job?<br />
	  3. What is important for me to know about you?<br />
	  4. What do you want for me?<br />
	  5. What do I need to know about my Life Purpose?<br />
	  6. What is the special name I should use for you?	</p>
	
    <a name="Guided"></a>
<span style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;">What&rsquo;s New: Guided Imaging to Meet Your Captain</span></p>
	<p>This process replaces the Guided Inner Journey to Future Self.</p>
