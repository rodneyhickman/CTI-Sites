                        <p style="color:#699bbc;">WELCOME! YOU HAVE EMBARKED ON A UNIQUE PATH THAT WILL CREATE A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FUTURE.</p>
                        <p style="color:#699bbc;">THE FUNDAMENTALS COURSE IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE CO-ACTIVE COACHING CURRICULUM. IT IS ALSO A COURSE THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN IF YOU WANT TO LEARN COACHING SKILLS, BUT DON&rsquo;T NECESSARILY WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL COACH. THERE ARE NO PREREQUISITES TO TAKE THIS COURSE.</p>
                        <p style="color:#699bbc;text-transform:uppercase;">Please note:&nbsp; Use of CTI Intellectual Property.&nbsp; CTI students may use materials presented during their course work, including materials on CTI&rsquo;s Learning Hub, in their work with their coaching clients only.&nbsp; Any use of CTI Intellectual Property beyond one-to-one coaching is not allowed without the specific written approval of CTI.</p>

                        <h2>How To Use the Learning Hub</h2>
                        <p>The  Learning Hub is designed to support what you have learned during the  course and to provide you with tools and resources to further your  development as a coach.</p>
                        Use the links in the left-hand column to navigate through the Learning Hub. Click <a href="bda.html#before">here</a> to get access to Pre-Work and Homework <strong>Before your course</strong>, <strong>During your course</strong>, and <strong>After your course</strong>.</p>
                        Click on <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> to get access to more detail on the <strong>Topics</strong> covered in the classroom, templates of the <strong>Tools</strong> mentioned, and a range of <strong>Business Resources</strong> that will help you establish and run your coaching practice.</p>
                        For example, in the <strong>Topics</strong> section under <strong><em>Working With Clients</em></strong> you can find directions on how to coach your clients; in the <strong>Tools</strong> section under <strong><em>Wheel of Life</em></strong> you can find a template of the Wheel to print out and re-use when needed; in the <strong>Business Resources</strong> section you can find <strong><em>Invest in Yourself</em></strong> to learn how to keep augmenting your skills as a coach.</p>

                        <h2>Your Course Leaders</h2>
                        <p>One of the first things you will notice as a participant in the Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals Course is that there are two course leaders instead of one. Next, people often notice is that the presentation style of the two leaders is more like a collaborative dance than two separate leaders each presenting a selected portion of the agenda.</p>
                        At CTI, we believe that every individual brings a unique combination of gifts and talents to their coaching and leadership. With the Co-Active model, we are not aiming to produce &ldquo;cookie-cutter&rdquo; coaches. Our goal instead is to provide an adaptable model that provides both a solid philosophical foundation along with room for each participant to incorporate their own expression. In the co-leadership of your two course leaders, you will see a working example of the dance we believe is central to effective coaching.</p>
                        All of our course leaders are Certified Professional Co-Active Coaches (CPCCs) meaning they have completed all of the CTI coursework including the six-month intensive certification program. Many are Professional Certified Coaches (PCCs) through the International Coach Federation or Master Certified Coaches (MCCs).</p>

                        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
