								<p>At Business Catalyst Institute&#153; we know that students arrive with different skills and at varying stages of building a thriving, fulfilling business. One size does not fit all, so we've created our program to work with your needs, whether you are just starting out or wanting to expand. Our courses are offered via small group teleclasses, in short affordable modules that focus on a specific area of business development such as attracting clients, defining your niche, developing your brand, marketing and other business-related topics.

This approach is central to all of our courses.</p>
