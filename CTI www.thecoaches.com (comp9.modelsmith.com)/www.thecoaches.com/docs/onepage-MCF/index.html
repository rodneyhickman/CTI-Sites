    <h1>Overview</h1>


<p>
Welcome to your Co-active Talent Champions program with the Coaches Training Institute. You are embarking on an important learning process that will impact your capacity to bring forward the best talent in all of your people. The program includes an integrated set of components to foster your learning, provide you with a direct experience of coaching, and support you in bringing new skills directly to your role in the company. Your full engagement in this learning process can dramatically alter your capacity to bring out the best in those you work with.
<br /> <br />
The program components are described below.
</p>


      
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Experiential Workshop</h1>
    <p> 
    The Talent Champions program is rooted in Co-active Coaching techniques and focuses on fundamentally transforming the relationship between a manager and their team and/or peers. The manager does not serve as a formal coach, but rather fosters a culture where every team member is fully engaged in meeting the demands of the business. Managers learn to shift from command and control to a posture that naturally evokes the greatest potential in each employee.
	<br /> 
<br /> 
Learning coaching skills is much like learning golf or tennis; Theory and principles are helpful but it takes practice and feedback to become proficient. During the session you will spend about 75% of the time practicing in a variety of formats that includes pairs, triads, small groups, and whole group exercises. There is no role playing per se, when you are practicing, you use real situations that you face at work or at home.

    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Coaching Practice<span class="h2detail"></span></h1>
    <p>
We recommend that you practice your coaching skills with your colleagues or internal clients as you go through the program.
	</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Learning Integration Session</h1>
<p>
The capstone to the Talent Champions program is CTI’s Learning Integration Session. As scheduled, following the workshop, participants will participate in one 60-minute 1:1 learning session with a member of CTI’s senior faculty. The focus for the session will be to review and “lock-in” personal learning and to draft a personal development plan for ongoing reflection and skill-building. This development plan can form the foundation for follow-up executive coaching sessions.
