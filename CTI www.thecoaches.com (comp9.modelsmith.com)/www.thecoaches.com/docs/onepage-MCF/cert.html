    <h1>Coaching Supervision Overview</h1>
    <p>Many coaching students consider supervision one of the most useful components of their coach training because it is individualized and tailored to your specific learning needs and learning style. Supervision is like having a personal trainer alongside you as you sculpt, tone and strengthen your Co-Active coaching skills. </p>
	<p>Your supervisors are highly experienced CPCCs, who are passionate about coaching and honored to usher you through this stage of your coach training journey. Your supervisor is your partner and guide whose primary focus is your growth and development as a Co-Active coach.  Your supervisors look forward to engaging with you in this process. Your enthusiastic participation in your supervision process will extend your reach and expand your range as a Co-Active coach.</p>
	<p>You will schedule (2) supervision sessions with your supervisor, each session is one hour long.

Schedule one session after your Fulfillment course and one session after your Balance course and have both before completing your workshops.

      Before each supervison, you will need to record a coaching session to share with your supervisor.</p>

      You will find your supervisor's contact information and scheduling suggestions in this <a href="/pdfs/Cargill-Supervision-Assign-V1.01.doc" target="_blank">downloadable Word doc</a>. Please review the information below to prepare for supervisions.

    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">What you will need for each supervision call</h1>
    <p>To maximize the value of your supervision calls you should meet with your client for at least two sessions before you begin recording for the purpose of supervision and do not bring recordings of sessions that are structured coaching techniques (e.g., Discovery Session, Future Self, Wheel of Life). Keep a log or journal of your learning from each supervision. </p>
    
    <p>Prior to each supervision call you will need to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Schedule a time with your supervisor</li>
      <li>Select a client with whom you have established a relationship</li>
      <li>Have the client <a href="pdfs/Cargill-ClientReleaseForm.pdf ">sign a release form</a>.</li>
      <li>Record a coaching session</li>
      <li>Test the recording to make sure it worked and is clear. (an inaudible recording is considered as a supervision rescheduled with less than 24 hours notice)</li>
      <li>Email the recording to your supervisor at least 48 hours prior to your supervision appointment (You may send your email up to 1 week prior to your appointment)</li>
      <li>Have your <a href="pdfs/CG-Sup-Review-V3.pdf">Supervision Review Sheet</a> handy. (You will need to complete page 1 before your first call.)</li>
      </ol>
    <p>*Note: When you have completed your supervision, it is your responsibility to destroy the recording of the coaching session in your possession.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">On your first Supervision call – Design your Alliance</h1>
    <p>Plan to spend a few extra minutes on your first supervision call designing your alliance with your
      supervisor. Your <a href="pdfs/CG-Sup-Review-V3.pdf">Supervision Review Sheet</a> lists some suggested areas to cover in your design. 
      Remember that this is YOUR designed alliance with your supervisor, so create the relationship
      that will best support your learning. This first call is also your opportunity to design the kind of
      feedback you want to receive, and to ask your supervisor any questions that you may have
      about supervision. You and your supervisor can make changes in your designed alliance at any
      time during the supervision process.</p>

    <p>Although your supervisors are highly experienced coaches, their role in supervision is to provide expert feedback. This supervision role is quite different than a coach’s role. Your supervisors are eager to support you in your learning. Because it is so direct and so
      specific, the supervision process can sometimes be challenging to adult learners. The intent and
      purpose of the supervision component of your program is to support you in becoming the best
      Co-Active coach you can be. We ask that you continue to develop your ability to listen at Level 2
      and Level 3 and that you receive your supervision feedback in that context. Your supervisor’s
      expert opinion is just that, an expert opinion. Take in the information and feedback that is useful
      to you, and let go of the rest.</p>

 	<h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">General Tips for Getting Clear Recordings</h1>
    <p>High-quality recordings of your coaching sessions will add value to your supervision experience. When your recording is clear and easy to hear, your supervisor can give their full attention to listening to your coaching and giving you feedback. </p>

	<p>If your recording is inaudible or cannot be understood, the Supervision may need to be rescheduled, incurring additional costs.</p> 

	<p>Equipment failure happens often, so please record all coaching sessions for which you have permission. These recordings will give you more learning experiences to choose from</p>

	<p>Here are some tips for high-quality recordings:<br />
	<ol>

<li>VOX (Voice Activation feature on many recording devices) must be turned OFF to make a high-quality Supervision recording.</li>

<li>If you are recording a telephone session, use a landline, not a mobile telephone. Make sure there are no background noises while you are recording.</li>

<li>If you are recording an in-person session, hold your session indoors, in a quiet, private environment with no background noise. You must use equipment designed for recording two people speaking. Test your equipment ahead of time with another person, in the coaching space. Pay particular attention to the volume setting and location of your microphones, since microphones will sometimes pick up background noise, or they will pick up one voice clearly and not the other.</li>
	</ol>
