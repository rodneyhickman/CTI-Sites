							<h1 id="main-headline">Certification — Registration Guidelines</h1>

							

							<p>Students may pre-register for the Certification program at any time by submitting a Registration Request form and paying the deposit.</p>

							

							<p>Applications for the Certification program are accepted after students have completed the first four core coaching courses: Co-Active Fundamentals, Fulfillment, Balance, and Process. The last coach training course, Synergy, may be taken during Certification due to course availability. Synergy must be completed prior to taking the Certification exam.</p>

							

							<ul>

								<p>&raquo; Submit a complete program application by the due date for the month in which you are registered. Your application must be approved prior to the scheduling process for your registered month.<br />
	&raquo; Upon application approval, students will be enrolled into a Certification &ldquo;pod&rdquo; of nine participants. The number of pods in any given month depends upon the number of applications received. A student will not be enrolled into a particular program pod until they have satisfied the pre-requisites and submitted a complete application.</li>

						  </ul>

							

							<h2>Program Components</h2>

							<ul class="followsh2">

								<p>&raquo; Weekly group teleconference calls provide a forum for practical learning application and group support as students move through the program. The Certification Program Leader is on the group calls delivering instruction and content. On the alternating weeks, students meet in triads for skill building exercises and coaching. These weekly calls are 1&frac12; hours once a week for 25 weeks.<br />
	&raquo; Pre-recorded lectures and trainings by <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> founders and leaders offer content and sample coaching sessions on the topic of the week. Recordings are listened to prior to each of the weekly teleconference calls. Average listening time is 30 minutes per week.<br />
	&raquo; Practical experience and integration of what you are learning by coaching clients using the Co-Active model. By the second pod call in the third week of the program, students will be expected to complete a roster of at least five paying clients. Students must maintain at least five clients throughout the program and must complete 100 hours of coaching with clients before taking the Certification Exam.<br />
	&raquo; Recorded Supervisions provide feedback on what is working well in the students coaching and what areas need improvement. Students review tapes of previous coaching appointments and debrief with a Certified <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> Supervisor. There are nine one-hour supervisions.<br />
	&raquo; Special Topic Calls cover a wide variety of topics related to coaching. Two calls are required. Calls are up to one hour each.<br />
	&raquo; Homework and reading assignments deepen your knowledge and experience of Co-Active Coaching. The time involved averages one to two hours weekly.<br />
	&raquo; On-going work with a Certified Professional Co-Active Coach (<abbr>CPCC</abbr>), Professional Certified Coach (<abbr>PCC</abbr>) or Master Certified Coach (<abbr>MCC</abbr>) helps support you throughout the program. The time involved averages 30 minutes per week.</li>

							</ul>



							<h2>Optional Component</h2>

							<ul class="followsh2">

								<p>&raquo; Exam Prep Calls provide support and information about the Oral Exam. Offered monthly, you may attend one or more of these calls. The average call is 60 minutes.<br />
	&raquo; Assisting in <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>&rsquo;s Core Curriculum (Fundamentals of Co-Active Coaching through Synergy) provides the opportunity to re-visit learning from earlier programs, and further integrate Co-Active Coaching skills.</li>
