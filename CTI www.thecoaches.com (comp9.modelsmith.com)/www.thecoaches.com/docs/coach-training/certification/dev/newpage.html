        Additional Notes for Thomas:
    </p>
    <p>
        On this page remove the Certification Starting Date pulldown.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registration and Application Process
    </p>
    <p>
        Registration for the Certification Program is a more complex process than for our other courses. There are four steps to the process outlined below.
        Please read and follow these steps carefully to ensure you are accepted into the program and can begin on your desired start date.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Register and Pay Deposit</h2>
<p>If you have already registered in a package that includes the Certification Program you may skip to Step 2.</p>
<p>
  Before beginning the Certification Program, you must first register for the program and pay your deposit. If you are not currently registered, please
  use the registration form in the sidebar to the right to register now.
</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Program Fees</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have not previously registered, the Certification enrollment fee is $4,400, this is comprised of a deposit of $710 due at the time of
        registration, and a balance of $3,690. (Your pricing may different If you registered into a discount package. In that event, your deposit will be on
        file.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The balance is due payments are as follows: the first of five automatic credit card charges will take place the 1st of the month following the start
        date of your program and approximately every 30 days thereafter. These payments will be charged to the credit card you have provided at the time of
        registration. Your account must be current for you to register for your exam. CTI reserves the right to dismiss you from the program if your account is
        more than 30 days in arrears.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a third party is paying for your program, they must provide a credit card or pay the balance in full up front. The funds can be sent by wire
        transfer directly to our Bank. Please be aware that monthly payments being made by wire transfers are not acceptable. We will only accept wire
        transfers for the full amount of the program. You can contact our Certification Program Specialist for wiring instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/policy.html">Review program policies here</a>        </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Declare a Start Month    </h2>
    <p>
      Each month the Certification Program is filled on a first-come, first-served basis. Your place in line, as the program is being filled, is determined by
      the date you declared that month as your start date. You are eligible to declare your start month when you complete Process. As soon as you complete
      the Process course, use the online form below to declare the month you intend to begin the program. To keep your place in the queue you still must
      submit a completed application by the deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submit the <a href="file://localhost/page/certificationapplication/FbONvPrE">Start Month Declaration</a> form</p>
    <p>
(Thomas the link for Start Month Declaration hyper link is        <a href="file://localhost/page/certificationapplication/FbONvPrE">https://ctileadership.dabbledb.com/page/certificationapplication/FbONvPrE</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have already declared a start month and you wish to change that date, you must phone the office and speak to the Certification Specialist.
        </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Submit your Official Application    </h2>
    <p>
      You must be registered prior to submitting your application.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, download the Information Packet, which is a pdf document that will explain the program requirements in detail and provide instructions on how to
        complete your Application. Read the Information Packet completely and carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Download the <u>Information Packet</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thomas the info packet pdf is with the email and should be linked to the above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, complete your application using the online form. Be certain you have all the necessary information prepared including hiring your certified coach
        before you begin the application. The application is due the 1st of the month before the month you want to start. For example, if you want to start in
        February, then your application is due January 1st.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submit the <a href="file://localhost/page/certificationapplication/nhUBeDSc">Official Application</a>
    </p>
    <p>
(Thomas - the link for the application hyperlink is        <a href="file://localhost/page/certificationapplication/nhUBeDSc">https://ctileadership.dabbledb.com/page/certificationapplication/nhUBeDSc</a> )
    </p>
    <p>
        Submit your application early, particularly if you have not yet declared your start month, to hold your space in a specific month. Spaces are limited
        each month and applications are taken on a first come first serve basis.        </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Submit Credit Card    </h2>
    <p>
      All participants, with the exception of those who paid the program fees in full at the time of registration, must have a valid credit card on file.
      When you click submit on your online Application, you will be taken to a page where you will submit the credit card for which you want your automatic
      monthly fees to be charged.        </p>
    <h2>Step 5: Acceptance    </h2>
    <p>
      Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be notified by CTI regarding acceptance into the Certification Program and your next
      steps.
    </p>
