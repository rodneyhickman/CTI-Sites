  <h1 id="main-headline" style="line-height:32px;">Registration and Application Process</h1>

    <p>
      Registration for the Certification Program is a more complex process than for our other courses. There are four steps to the process outlined below. Please read and follow these steps carefully to ensure you are accepted into the program and can begin on your desired start date. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Register and Pay Deposit</h2>

    <p>
        If you have already registered in a package that includes the Certification Program skip <em>Step 1: Register and Pay Deposit</em> and go to <em>Step 2: Declare a Start Month.</em> </p>
<p>Before beginning the Certification Program, you must first register for the program and pay your deposit. If you are not currently registered, please use the registration form in the sidebar to the right to register now. 
    </p>



  
    <p><strong>Program Fees</strong></p>

    <p>

If you have not previously registered, the Certification enrollment fee is $4,620, this is comprised of a deposit of $710, due at the time of registration, and a balance of $3,910. (Your pricing may be different if you registered into a discount package. In that event, your deposit will be on file.) There is a separate fee of $500 for the oral exam.  This will be due at the time you register for the oral exam.
  </p><p>
The balance is due as follows: the first of five automatic credit card charges will take place the 1st of the month following the start date of your program and approximately every 30 days thereafter. These payments will be charged to the credit card you have provided at the time of registration. Your account must be current for you to register for your exam. CTI reserves the right to dismiss you from the program if your account is more than 30 days in arrears.
  </p><p>
If a third party is paying for your program, they must provide a credit card or pay the balance in full up front. The funds can also be sent by wire transfer directly to our Bank. Please be aware that monthly payments being made by wire transfers are not acceptable. We will only accept wire transfers for the full amount of the program. You can contact our Certification Program Specialist for wiring instructions.
</p>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/policy.html">Review program policies here</a></p>







    <h2>Step 2: Declare a Start Month</h2>

    <p>
Declaring a start month will put you on a list to get reminders about your application due date.  You still must submit a completed application by the deadline for the month in which you registered. The application is due the 1st of the month before the month you want to start. For example, if you want to start in February, then your application is due January 1st. We do not start any new classes in the month of December. If you have completed your Process course and are ready to submit a completed application — Skip <em>Step 2: Declare a Start Month</em> and go directly to <em>Step 3: Application</em>.
</p><p>
If you have already declared a start month and you wish to change that date, you must phone the office and speak to the Certification Specialist. 
</p>




    <h2>Step 3: Submit your Official Application</h2>
    
    <p>
You must be registered prior to submitting your application and have completed your Process course.
</p><p>
First, download the Information Packet, which is a pdf document that will explain the program requirements in detail and provide instructions on how to complete your Application. Read the Information Packet completely and carefully. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Download the <a href="CPCC-Info-Packet-V5.pdf">Information Packet</a></p>
    <p>
Next, complete your application using the online form. Be certain you have all the necessary information prepared including hiring your certified coach before you begin the application. The application is due the 1st of the month before the month you want to start. For example, if you want to start in February, then your application is due January 1st. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Submit the <a target="_blank" href="http://ww2.thecoaches.com/launchpad/ctiforms/Certification">Official Application</a></p>

    <p>
  Submit your application early to hold your space in a specific month. Spaces are limited each month and applications are taken on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
        </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Submit Credit Card</h2>
    <p>
      All participants, with the exception of those who paid the program fees in full at the time of registration, must have a valid credit card on file. Please submit your credit card to be put on file.
</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Submit Credit Card"
    onclick="window.open('cccapture.html','_blank');" />


    </p>
    
    <p>
Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be notified by CTI regarding your next steps. 
    </p>
