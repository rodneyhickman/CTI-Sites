Set up a client for you(r) practice coaching session on the evening of Day 2 of your course.<br /><br />
 
Arrange your life so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your 2 and ½ days.<br /><br />

<hr class="lightdouble left150" /> 
    
<p class="left150">
<h2 class="left150">After your course</h2>
<p class="left150">
Coaching is a skill and it requires practice. Here are some suggestions on how you can practice before your Fulfillment course:<br />

<img style="float:right;" src="/images/compentency.gif">

<ol class="left150"><li>Pick a new competency each day from the competency practice sheet</u> and try it out with colleagues, clients and friends and notice the impact on you and them.<br />&nbsp;
</li><li>Enlist two people to become your practice clients. Charge them a minimal fee. Tell them you are training to become a professional coach.

We recommend that you have a discovery session with them in person to design the alliance and train them in some basic concepts (requests, accountability, Saboteur using your intuition). You may want to do the wheel of life with them.
Note: You will learn more about the discovery session in the Fulfillment course.<br />&nbsp;
</li><li>Hire a personal coach for yourself. There is nothing like being in a coaching relationship yourself to help you understand the benefits of coaching.<br />&nbsp;
</li>
</ol>

  <blockquote>


&#8221;Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force...When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. Ideas actually begin to grow within us and come to life...When we listen to people there is an alternating current, and this recharges us so that we never get tired of each other...and it is this little creative fountain inside us that begins to spring and cast up new thoughts and unexpected laughter and wisdom. ...Well, it is when people really listen to us, with quiet fascinated attention, that the little fountain begins to work again, to accelerate in the most surprising way.&#8221;<br />
