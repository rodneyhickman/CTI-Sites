Synergy is about bringing your coaching to a new level of fluidity and professionalism. <br /><br />
The core skill in this course is to expand your confidence, power and authority in coaching. <br /><br />
In this course, you will learn to call forth and challenge your clients and have your coaching be direct and potent. You will learn to respond fluidly and use your intuition to create &#8216;in the moment&#8217; rather than applying specific techniques.

Developing coaching skill is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice and sustain your new skills:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Continue to enroll clients into your coaching practice. (You will need five clients by the time you are in your third week of the Certification Program)<br />
<br />
<li> While thinking about your existing clients, answer the following questions:<br />
<ul>
<li>How will you call them forth this week?<br />
</li><li>Where have you been holding back?<br />
</li><li>What is the next place of authenticity with this client?<br />
</li><li>How will you deepen the connection and safety with each client?<br />
</li><li>How alive has the coaching been? How alive and engaged is the client?<br />
</li><br />
</ul>

<li> Use the coaching aids in the Resources and Tools section of the manual to help you tap into the three principles of Co-Active Coaching and add variety to your sessions.
