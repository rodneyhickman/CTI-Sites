    <dt class="first"><a href="/coach-training/courses/course_fundamentals.html" id="course_fundamentals" name="course_fundamentals">Course1: Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The two and a half day Co-Active Fundamentals course is the first course in our Co-Active Coaching curriculum. Whether you are interested in using coaching skills in your current profession, considering a career in coaching, or just wanting to improve your communication with the important people in your life, Co-Active Fundamentals has something for you.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="/coach-training/courses/course_fulfillment.html" id="course_fulfillment" name="course_fulfillment">Course 2: Fulfillment</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>In this course, you will develop skills for helping clients discover their unique values, identify self-defeating influences, and create their own vision for a compelling future. Fulfillment coaching is about helping clients to let go of preconceived rules and limitations and to step into what truly brings them alive.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="/coach-training/courses/course_balance.html" id="course_balance" name="course_balance">Course 3: Balance</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>In this course, coaches learn to assist their clients in developing new perspectives and creating a plan of action grounded in commitment. Because people live in constant motion, it's easy to forget that we have a choice in everything we do. Balance coaching is about guiding clients toward making powerful life choices and selecting the experiences they want most, rather than dashing about either at the mercy of circumstances or trying to 'have it all.'</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="/coach-training/courses/course_process.html" id="course_process" name="course_process">Course 4: Process</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>In this course, coaches learn how to help clients work through emotionally-charged issues and to understand that, although uncomfortable, chaos, confusion and inertia are part of a client's forward motion. Process coaching is about being with clients wherever they are on the flowing river of their lives, allowing them to more fully know themselves, and helping them to develop an enduring life purpose statement.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="/coach-training/courses/course_inthebones.html" id="course_inthebones" name="course_inthebones">Course 5: Synergy</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This course focuses on integrating coaching skills learned in previous courses and taking Co-Active Coaching to a higher level of impact and professionalism. It provides polish, depth and courage to better respond to a wide range of clients and coaching situations with creativity, confidence, and power. In-the-Bones coaching relies on intuition to create 'in the moment' rather than applying staid techniques or rules.</p>
