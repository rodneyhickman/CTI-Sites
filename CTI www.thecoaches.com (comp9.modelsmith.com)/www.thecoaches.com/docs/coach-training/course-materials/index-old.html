    <h1>FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
    <p>
Welcome! You have embarked on a unique path that will create a noticeable difference in your relationships in the future. CTI is known across the globe for engaging hands-on training. In addition, we know that blending different learning methods, techniques and resources allows different types of learners access to develop their skills. <br /> 
Please use this blended learning environment to make your learning independent, useful, sustainable and ever growing. Select the activities that best to suit your style, pace and level. <br /> 
<br /> 
<h2>Before your course</h2>
    <p>
<u>Companion Text:</u> The CO-ACTIVE COACHING Book (second edition). You will have an opportunity to acquire the book in the Fundamentals course if you don&#8217;t already have it.<br /> 
<br /> 
If you already have the book, take a look at the first three chapters that will introduce the Co-active coaching model, the coaching relationship and the context of listening. <br /> 
<br /> 
<u>Course Manual:</u> In keeping with our Green Business Certification, we have eliminated mass printing and shipping of course manuals. Please join us in our effort to reduce by downloading the Fundamentals course manual in pdf form.<br /> 
<br /> 
You may want to scan the Manual prior to your course. Keep the manual on hand as a resource as you progress through the curriculum.<br /> 
<br /> 
<h2>During your course</h2>
    <p>
In this course you will create a foundation for communication with others that will generate a deep connection with clients, co-workers, family and friends. Enjoy the experience, it is likely to be one you won&#8217;t soon forget.<br /> 
Set up a client for you to do a practice coaching session on the evening of Day 2 of your course.<br /> 
Set your life up so that you can dive in and have your attention fully on the course and the experience during your 2 and Â½ days. <br /> 
Do your homework! <br /> 
<br /> 
<b>After your course</b><br /> 
Coaching is a skill and it requires practice. Here are some suggestions on how you can practice before your Fulfillment course:<br /> 
<li>Pick a new competency each day from the <u>competency practice sheet</u> and try it out with colleagues, clients and friends and notice the impact on you and them.<br />
[competency graphic]<br /> 
</li><li>Enlist two people to become your practice clients. Charge them a minimal fee. Tell them you are training to become a professional coach.

We recommend that you have a discovery session with them in person to design the alliance and train them in some basic concepts (requests, accountability, Saboteur using your intuition). You may want to do the wheel of life with them.
Note: You will learn more about the discovery session in the Fulfillment course.<br /> 
</li><li>Hire a personal coach for yourself. There is nothing like being in a coaching relationship yourself to help you understand the benefits of coaching.<br /> 
</li><br />

&#8221;Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force...When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. Ideas actually begin to grow within us and come to life...When we listen to people there is an alternating current, and this recharges us so that we never get tired of each other...and it is this little creative fountain inside us that begins to spring and cast up new thoughts and unexpected laughter and wisdom. ...Well, it is when people really listen to us, with quiet fascinated attention, that the little fountain begins to work again, to accelerate in the most surprising way.&#8221;<br />
