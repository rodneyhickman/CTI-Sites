<h1>BALANCE</h1>
<p class="bluecaps" style="color:#838d4a;">
  Balance coaching is about powerful choices and intentional action. <br /><br />
The core skill of Balance coaching is the ability to identify and choose your perspective and to make a conscious commitment to action.  <br /><br />
In this course, you will learn to guide clients toward making powerful life choices and selecting the experiences they want most, rather than being at the mercy of their circumstances.

<p class="">
Developing coaching skill is all about practicing. Here are some ways you can practice and sustain your new skills before your Process course:<br />
<br />
    <ol class="">
<li> Tell people that you have an assignment to practice Balance coaching. Ask them to do sample sessions with you and practice Balance coaching with them.</li>
<br />
<li>Use these practice sessions to enroll a few new clients. Choose the number of clients that is right for you.</li><br />
<li>Charge your clients the amount of money that feels right to you. Let them know you are in training to become a professional coach. Meet with them three to four times per month for a specific amount of time.
</li><br />
<li>Review the suggested structures for keeping clients in action. Work with your clients to develop structures that keep them in action.<br />&nbsp;</li>

<img src="cti_balanceFormulaGraphic.gif" style="margin-left:-30px;" /><br/>&nbsp;

<li>Work with the Balance Formula until you are familiar with each step. For example,  spend one day listening for perspectives, spend another day brainstorming new perspectives, listen for perspectives in everyday conversation, etc...</li>
</ol>
