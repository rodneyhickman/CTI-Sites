<p>
    Do you want to make more money from your coaching practice? Do you want an ongoing stream of clients that you want to serve, who want, and can afford your
    coaching? We know you believe in coaching and want to share it with others while making a solid living. The next step in building your &#8220;Marketing
    Money Machine&#8221; is to become irresistible to clients out there. That is marketing.
</p>
<p>
    We&#8217;ll show you how to follow the lead of successful coaches who engage in <i>ongoing</i> marketing by leveraging your Co-Active coaching skills to
    attract clients you want to work with, who align with your values, and want what you offer. Let us help you create a marketing system designed to make it
    easy for you to continually build and nurture the new contacts and relationships who will feed your money machine.
</p>
<p>
    In Co-Active Marketing you will:
</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Define the specific, viable and lucrative target market that your coaching can best serve.</li>

	<li>Build the outreach tools that will reach and impact this specific market of potential clients.</li>
	<li>Handle &ldquo;No&rdquo; and other objections effectively.</li>
</ul>
