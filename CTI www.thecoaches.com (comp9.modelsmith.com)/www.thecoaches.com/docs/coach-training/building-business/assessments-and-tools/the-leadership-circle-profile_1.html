<h1 id="main-headline">The Leadership Circle Profile</h1>

<p><b>Now Your Client&#8217;s Opportunities for Development </b><b>Rise to the Surface Instantly</b><br /> 
<br /> 
<i>The Leadership Circle Profile (TLCP)</i> is the only 360 degree instrument that measures the two primary leadership domains &#8212; Creative Competencies and Reactive Tendencies &#8212; and integrates this information so that the key opportunities for development immediately rise to the surface.<br /> 
<br /> 
<u>Creative Competencies</u> are well-researched competencies that measure how you achieve results, bring out the best in others, lead with vision, enhance your own development, act with integrity and courage, and improve organizational systems.<br /> 
<br /> 
<u>Reactive Tendencies</u> are leadership styles that emphasize caution over creating results, self-protection over productive engagement, and aggression over building alignment. These self-limiting styles overemphasize the focus on gaining the approval of others, protecting yourself, and getting results through high control tactics.<br /> 
<br /> 
Most importantly, TLCP is unique in that it reveals a leader&#8217;s Operating System: The internal assumptions (beliefs) that run behavior in both domains. This allows the manager see how his/her inner world of thought is translating into a productive or unproductive style of leadership. Ultimately TLCP increases the inner awareness that affects outward behavior.<br /> 
<br />
  <center><img src="/images/circle360.gif"><br /><br />
 <b> </b><i>With its rich theory base, TLCP is more than just a 360, </i><br /> 
<i>it is a powerful platform for transformation.</i><br /> </center>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>What Makes The Leadership Circle Profile Unique?</b><br /> 
<b>It&#8217;s So Incredibly Effective and Easy to Use!</b><br /> 
<br /> 
<b>Unlike most surveys, TLCP is a world beyond a mere a laundry list of behaviors.</b><br /> 
<br /> 
<i>The Leadership Circle Profile</i> integrates well-researched leadership competencies into a unified framework. This framework accelerates insight, deepens awareness, and highlights leverage points for change.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>TLCP displays results within a high impact framework, not merely in the rank order scores found in most surveys. </b>TLCP'shigh impact framework springs from the very best models of adult development. This framework shows leaders both how they are doing and spotlights the hidden motivators that drive successful and unsuccessful behavior. It also enables the coach or consultant who works with the leader to &#8220;meet with them where they are&#8221; &#8212; at whatever level or depth at which they have the capacity to work.<br /> 
<br /> 
<b>TLCP&#8217;s focus and accessibility never overwhelms managers with unrelated data. </b>Using TLCP, managers can, at a glance, see the whole picture without laboring over volumes of data. TLCP elegantly displays the critical relationships between strengths and weaknesses, creative competencies and reactive tendencies, and the interaction between inner assumptions and outer behavior.<br />
