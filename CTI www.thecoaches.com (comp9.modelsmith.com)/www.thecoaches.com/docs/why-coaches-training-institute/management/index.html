									<h2>Laura Whitworth, <abbr title="Certified Professional Co-Active Coach">CPCC</abbr>, <abbr title="Master Certified Coach">MCC</abbr>, President and Co-Founder</h2>

									

									<p>Laura Whitworth, co-founder of the <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>, passed away in February 2007 after a two year battle with lung cancer. Laura's legacy helped shape the coaching industry with determination, persistence, creativity and compassion. Her numerous accomplishments have touched and changed many lives in profound ways.</p>

									

									<div id="ct-bio3" class="stuff">

										<p>As a Certified Professional coach, Laura nurtured individuals, groups, teams and organizations toward greater productivity and effectiveness. She worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and organizations including Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Pacific Bell and the Oakland Unified School District. In 1997, she was named among the ten most influential coaches by Professional Coach Journal.</p>

										

										<p>In the very early years of the coaching profession, Laura was a founding member of the Personal and Professional Coaches Association, which merged with the International Coach Federation (<abbr>ICF</abbr>). Laura co-founded the Association of Coaching Training Organizations (<abbr>ACTO</abbr>), an organization created to steward high quality coach training and evolve the industry. In 2002, Laura co-founded The Bigger Game Company with Rick Tamlyn, a transformative program designed to explore new ways for individuals or teams within organizations to lead.</p>

										

										<p>In her spare time, Laura co-authored Co-Active Coaching, a best selling book that helped define the field of professional coaching. Laura also led the effort to take the Co-Active Coaching model into federal and state prisons where it continues to have a profound impact on the lives of inmates. In 2007, this program was renamed the Laura Whitworth Prison Project in her honor.</p>

										

										<p>Laura is best described as a fierce warrior and champion of the highest potential for each person she touched. She was bold, courageous, rigorous, incredibly brilliant and disarmingly human. She served this world well and called us all forth, over and over again, asking - demanding - that we reach for the stars. Her passing left a hole in the world of coaching and her presence among us is sorely missed.</p>
