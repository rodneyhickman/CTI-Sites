						<div class="pri">

							
							<p>In our performance-rewarding environment, it’s easy to lose sight of the value of real connection, intimacy, self-awareness, listening deeply to and nurturing others – the very qualities that inform and inspire what we do, restore us and give our lives fulfilling meaning.</p>
							 
							<p>Times are changing as the world becomes more and more complex and yet smaller. The need for us to work together to lead effectively is urgent. Relationship intelligence is suddenly paramount to success. We at CTI consider this good news.  For the past 20 years, we’ve trained tens of thousands to balance the “being” and the “doing” and have seen firsthand how our Co-Active Model catapults individuals and organizations into both higher achievement and deeper connection and fulfillment. Transformational change is our business. We want a world that works for everyone where people know that who we are is as important as what we do.</p>

							
							
							
							
							<!--
<h2 class="first">Philosophy</h2>

							<p>At <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>&#174;, we believe that the coaching industry is still only in its infancy and that huge opportunities for significant impact on our world lie ahead.</p>

							<p>Our courses are held primarily in-person because we believe that students learn best by addressing the rigors and challenges of coaching with as much personal experience, interaction with others and hands-on practice as possible.</p>

							<p>We also conduct all our workshops with two co-leaders and a small class size to ensure the personal attention and individualization of the instruction that allows each student to find his or her own unique voice and style.</p>

							<p>At <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>, we also appreciate that the greatest results are often achieved when you accept that real learning and growth can emerge from the seemingly illogical combination of divergent goals. To that end, we believe that passion is the greatest tool a professional can have to achieve success.</p>

							<ul>

								<li>Training can be both rigorous and fun</li>

								<li>Being and doing go hand-in-hand to foster growth</li>

								<li>Effective learning involves both individualized training and benefiting from the strengths, experiences and contributions of others</li>

								<li>Approaches to change can be both idealistic and pragmatic, and most importantly,</li>

								<li>Passion is the greatest tool any professional can have to achieve success.</li>

							</ul>

							<h2>The Co-Active Model</h2>

							<p>The Co-Active Model balances self-awareness, a keen agility with relationships, and courageous action to create an environment where individuals can be deeply fulfilled, connected to others and successful in what matters most.</p>
							
							<p>The “Co” in Co-Active suggests relationship, connection, intimacy and collaboration. Thus, the “Co” in us is curious, listens deeply, hears nuance, holds space for others, intuits and nurtures.</p>

							<p>The “Active” in Co-Active stands for power, direction, action and manifestation. So, the “Active” in us is courageous, has clarity and conviction, takes charge and achieves goals.</p>
							<img src="/res/img/Co-Active-Model-Image.gif" border="0" height="409" width="600" style="margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="The Co-Active Model" title="The Co-Active Model" />

							<p>The magic happens in the dance between “Co” and “Active” — action that arises from presence, deep relationship and context…and presence that is channeled into dynamic action and contribution. Balancing and blending these energies allows us to move out of an “either/or” paradigm into a “yes/and” paradigm. </p>
							
							<h2>Co-Active Training</h2>
							
							<p>Through Co-Active training, CTI is creating a transformative change in the way people relate to and work with each other. The work inspires people to feel engaged in and passionate about their life and work, see the good, get curious, create interactions unlike any other, become visionary, feel more alive, connect deeply to others, give real meaning to their lives, think much bigger, become great leaders and make a difference.</p>
							
							<p>The Co-Active Model has spawned a philosophy, a methodology, a skill set and a communication form that is being applied in business, education, medicine, government, communities and families all around the world.</p>

							<h2>Co-Active Coaching</h2>
							
							<p>Co-Active Coaching is an experience of personal and professional development unlike other kinds of coaching. Based on the Co-Active Model, it begins by holding the coachee as naturally creative, resourceful and whole, and completely capable of finding their own answers to whatever challenges they face. The job of a Co-Active Coach® is to ask powerful questions, listen and empower to elicit the skills and creativity a client already possesses, rather than instruct or advise. Co-Active coaching uses an array of proprietary tools developed by CTI that have been proven as the gold standard over the past 20 years of the coaching profession.</p>
							
							
							<!--
<p>Co-Active Coaching has impacted the lives and careers of thousands of managers, leaders, and coaches around the world. It has led to <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> becoming the world's first <abbr title="International Coach Federation">ICF</abbr>-accredited coach training program, the most widely used text book in coaching, the largest number of certified coaches globally and a powerful, experiential leadership program that unlocks participants' unique and natural leadership strengths.</p>

							<p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> coaching holds that people are naturally creative, resourceful and whole - completely capable of finding their own answers to whatever challenges they face. The job of a Co-Active Coach&#174; is to ask powerful questions, listen and empower to elicit the skills and creativity a client already possesses, rather than instruct or advise.</p>

							<p>To train successful coaches, <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> uses an approach that includes four key elements:</p>

							<ol>

							<li>In-depth, in-person Co-Active training</li>

							<li>Professional practicum leading to certification</li>

							<li>Business/entrepreneurial skills development</li>

							<li>A supportive community of coaches to foster ongoing growth</li>
