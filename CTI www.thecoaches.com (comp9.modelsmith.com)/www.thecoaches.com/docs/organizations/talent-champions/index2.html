							<h1 id="main-headline">Talent Champions</h1>

							

							<p>Managers at all levels of an organization are charged with the responsibility to recognize and develop the talent potential in each of his or her direct reports.</p>

							

							<p>The manager-employee relationship presents an inherently rich, but perpetually underleveraged, opportunity for inspiring transformational development throughout the organization. Meaningful manager-employee interaction has become an unintended casualty of the inordinate number of demands on the time of chronically overwhelmed managers. Unlocking the potential power in the employee-manager relationship does not add to this burden, but fundamentally transforms how the manager engages her team through day-to-day interactions.</p>

							

							<p><abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr> has developed a training curriculum, rooted in Co-Active coaching techniques, that works to fundamentally reconstruct the relationship between a manager and her team. The manager does not serve as a formal coach, but rather she uses the techniques to help employees see themselves as fully resourceful in meeting the demands of the business. Managers learn to shift modes from command and control to one that enables them to successfully elicit the talent potential inherent in each of her team members.</p>
