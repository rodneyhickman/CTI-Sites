<h1>Co-Active Sales Program (pilot)</h1>
<p class="larger"><em>Get at least 10 clients in the next 90 days or your money back!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Turbo-charge your coaching practice! Get at least 10 new clients in the next three months. CTI is offering a dynamic new sales training program that shows you how you can use your Co-Active coaching skills to successfully sell your services to prospective clients. This is your chance to participate in this pilot program at a special pilot price of $595 USD (regularly $725 USD). In this program you will benefit from four 90 minute experientially-based, virtual seminars and a 90-day accountability program that will give you the tools you need to succeed in selling coaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four seminars will help you:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Transform your current perspective on selling by understanding how to apply Co-Active principles to the sales process.</li>
<li>Learn to take a stand for what you are worth as a coach.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Learn to prospect for new clients in a fun and profitable way.</li>
<li>Use and manage your referral team.</li>
<li>Handle &ldquo;No&rdquo; and other objections effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And&mdash;there&rsquo;s more!</strong> The Co-Active Sales Program is not just another set of content-filled webinars. This program includes a 90-day, small-group accountability process. Nine small-group Accountability calls (led by one of the founders of this sales program) are spread over 90 days to support you in successfully implementing your sales strategy. For three months you will have the support you need to insure that these sales techniques and systems become habits you will use every week to build your practice. By the end of this program you will feel confidant and comfortable both in attracting new clients, and in receiving regular referrals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Who should attend Co-Active Sales Training?<br /> </em></strong><em>If you have a functioning website and marketing plan already in place and you are ready to propel your coaching business to the next level, then this program is for you.</em></p>
