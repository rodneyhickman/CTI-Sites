<!-- <p id="intro"></p> -->



<div class="pri">


<p><strong>PAYMENT AND ENROLLMENT</strong></p>
<p>You may pay by check, VISA, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Your signature on the Registration Request Form authorizes CTI to automatically charge your credit card. Balances due: five automatic credit card charges of $780 each will take place the 1<sup>st</sup> of the month following the start date of your program and approximately every 30 days thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All program enrollments are subject to availability. You will receive written notification of your enrollment status. If there is no space in the month you have selected, we will contact you about other options. Your enrollment in the Program is based on acceptance of your application and the receipt of funds for both the deposit and balance due. In the process of enrolling you in your requested program, CTI will notify you if there are questions about your application and/or if there are insufficient funds. If we do not hear from you within 48 hours of our notification, your requested space in the program will be released.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CERTIFICATION PROGRAM ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>In order to retain the Certification Program package discount, you must register for a specific start month and submit an application <strong>within 180 days</strong> of completing your Synergy course. You must start the Certification Program within twelve months of completing Synergy <strong>or your Certification discount will be forfeited and will revert to a la carte pricing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUYER&rsquo;S RIGHT TO CANCEL</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to cancel this enrollment agreement and receive a refund by delivering a written notice to: The Coaches Training Institute, Attn: Certification Program Specialist, 4000 Civic Center Drive, Suite 500, San Rafael, CA 94903, USA. You do not have the right to cancel by telephoning or e-mailing the school, or by not attending the program you are registered for. If you are a Minnesota student, please see the Minnesota Student Buyer&rsquo;s Right to Cancel.</p>
<p><strong>RIGHT OF REFUSAL</strong></p>
<p>CTI reserves the right to refuse a student participation in courses and/or programs. In addition, upon the recommendation of the CTI Program Leader, CTI reserves the right to remove from a program and/or classroom a student who is negatively impacting other students and/or the learning environment.</p>
<p><strong>REFUND POLICIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>For all Certification Program participants, except Minnesota Residents:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Information Regarding Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds</strong><strong>:</strong> If you choose to cancel your enrollment before the beginning of the program, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 non-refundable registration fee. If you cancel after the start of your program, a refund will be pro-rated for the unused portion of the program. If you withdraw from the program, after the 5th business day of the start of the course, you will receive a pro-rated refund, minus the $50 non-refundable registration fee, based on the time completed in the course. The refund is calculated from the postmarked date of the written notice. For example, if a student&rsquo;s cancellation is received after completing 50 program hours and paid $5,100, the refund would be calculated as follows: $5,100 (Program Tuition) - $50 (non-refundable Registration Fee) = $5,050 (Program Fee less Registration Fee).&nbsp; $5,050 divided by 92 (Total Program hours) = $54.89 (Amount per Program hour) x 42 (Program hours not attended) = $2,305.43 (Student Refund Amount).&nbsp; <strong>Transfer Fees:</strong><strong> </strong>Students may transfer from one course start date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made 60 days before the course start date.&nbsp; Subsequent transfers, as well as any transfer made within 60 days of the course start date, <strong>will be assessed a $175 fee.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Transfers are not allowed after we have confirmed you into a Pod.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Notice of Cancellation/ Withdrawal and Refunds:</strong> Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation/withdrawal is postmarked, or if hand-delivered, the date delivered to the school.&nbsp; Refunds will be made within 30 days following the receipt of written requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For California Residents Only:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Coaches Training Institute is licensed with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education, State of California.&nbsp; Licensing means we have met certain minimum standards imposed by the state for licensed schools on the basis of our written application to the state.&nbsp; You will receive an enrollment agreement that details the full refund and program policies for your state.</p>
<p><strong>For Minnesota Residents Only</strong> <strong>(Minnesota Student Buyer&rsquo;s Right to Cancel)</strong>:<strong>General Information Regarding Cancellations/ Withdrawals, and Refunds</strong><strong>: </strong>Each student will be notified of acceptance/rejection in writing.&nbsp; In the event a student is rejected, all tuition, fees and other charges shall be refunded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a student gives written notice of cancellation within five business days of the execution of the contract (for schools using written contracts) or day on which the student is accepted (for schools not using written contracts), then a complete refund is given regardless of whether the program has started. If a student gives written notice of cancellation after five business days of the execution of the contract (for schools using written contracts) or day on which the student is accepted (for schools not using written contracts), but before the first lesson has been serviced by the school, then all tuition, fees and other charges, except 15 percent of the total cost of the program (15 percent not to exceed $50.00) shall be refunded to the student. If a student gives written notice of cancellation after the first lesson is completed, but before completion of 75 percent of the period of instruction, then the student is assessed a pro rata portion of tuition, fees and all other charges based on the number of days in the term plus 25 percent of the total program cost (25 percent not to exceed $75.00). Any notice of cancellation shall be acknowledged in writing within 10 business days of receipt of such notice and all refunds shall be forwarded to the student within 30 business days of receipt of such notice. This refund policy is not linked to any student conduct policy and any promissory instrument shall not be negotiated prior to the completion of 50 percent of the course.&nbsp;<strong> </strong><strong>Notice of Cancellation/Withdrawal and Refunds:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation is postmarked or, in the case where the notice is hand carried, it shall occur on the date the notice is delivered to the school.&nbsp; The date of execution of the enrollment agreement shall be presumed to be the date of delivery of the notice of acceptance; and if delivered by mail, the postmark date of the letter of acceptance.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Transfer Fees:</strong>&nbsp; You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed), are assessed <strong>a USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</strong>. Certification program transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.&nbsp; <strong>Notice of Cancellation/Withdrawal and Refunds: </strong>Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation/withdrawal is postmarked, or if hand-delivered, the date delivered to the school.&nbsp; Refunds will be made within 30 days following the receipt of written requests. <strong>For California Residents Only: </strong>The Coaches Training Institute is licensed with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education, State of California.&nbsp; Licensing means we have met certain minimum standards imposed by the state for licensed schools on the basis of our written application to the state.&nbsp; You will receive an enrollment agreement that details the full refund and program policies for your state.&nbsp;</p>
