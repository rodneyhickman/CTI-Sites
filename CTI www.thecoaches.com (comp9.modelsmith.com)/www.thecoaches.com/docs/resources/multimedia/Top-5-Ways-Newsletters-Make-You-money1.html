<h1><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Top 5 Ways Newsletters Make You $$$</h1>
<p>By Linda Claire Puig</p>
<p>There are two kinds of marketing strategies: active and passive. Active strategies are things like speaking (and selling) or picking up the phone to call a prospective client. </p>
<p>Newsletters and other keep-in-touch strategies fall into the "passive" category. However, they are far from passive in the powerful ways that they can help you increase your income. </p>
<p>Here are five ways that newsletters help make you money: </p>
<p><b>Front & Center</b><br>A newsletter keeps you in front of people. Not everyone is ready to hire you on the spot. Not everyone needs your services this minute. But when they are ready, when they have a pressing need for what you offer and your newsletter shows up in their inbox or mailbox, you'll be the one to get the call, not someone who's dropped off their radar. </p>
<p><b>The Trusted Expert</b><br>A newsletter promotes your expertise constantly and creates trust in myriad ways. Top-level content that speaks to your audience makes them trust that you know what they're going through AND have the capacity and skills to help them with it. Without trust, people won't buy from you. The more people trust you, they more they will buy from you. </p>
<p><b>Promotional Support</b><br>Your newsletter is your forum. It not only educates your readers with education-based content but also informs them of opportunities to work with you to further their own goals. While I recommend that all promotions be mentioned in both "stand-alone" emails AND in your newsletter, without a newsletter, you're missing a primary promotional vehicle. Make certain to have a clear call-to-action for your promotions. </p>
<p><b>Power in the List</b><br>Your newsletter is the focal point of education-based marketing. The list of people you send it to are people who've "raised a hand" at one time or another to say that they are interested in what you have to offer. This list is one of the biggest assets you'll have in your business. Need some extra cash this month? Have a sale on your products or services. One woman I know, responding to a challenge from the leader of a seminar she was attending, created and sold a group coaching program in one evening. Her take: $15,000. She had a list she'd nurtured through the years with her newsletter. </p>
<p><b>Opportunity Magnet</b><br>The opportunities that come to you as a result of your newsletter are usually unexpected and often surprising. But if your newsletter is doing its job, promoting your expertise in a given area, people begin to associate you with that topic. You may be asked to speak for a gathering or to partner with someone on a project or something else. For example, in the last three months, at least 15 different people have asked me to speak to their audience about newsletters. The same can happen for you, and with these opportunities come dollars. </p>
<p>So instead of asking "How do I make money with a newsletter?" try putting out a regular, consistent, high-value newsletter and see what happens for yourself! </p>
