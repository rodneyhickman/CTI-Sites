<h1><br /><br /><br />The Basics of Effective Marketing-Accessible to YOU</h1>
<p>By Dorcas Kelley, CPCC</p>
    <p>
Three of the most common questions I'm asked are: How do I effectively market myself as a coach? How do I enroll clients? And what is this thing called        <em>branding</em> anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
        First, let's provide a definition for the elusive term of <em>marketing</em>. Bottom line, <em>marketing</em> refers to how your business shows up in
        the world. Simple, eh? Yes, it is a simple concept and it's also such a broad term that it can feel a bit overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marketing is an "umbrella" term, meaning that it includes several different categories of concepts and activities, such as client enrollment, marketing
        materials, networking, branding, advertising, pricing, your interaction with others, referral sources and-most importantly-how you energetically hold
        and present yourself. Wow! What a mouthful! Hopefully you can see that there are many places to play in the world of marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, just recognizing that marketing has several distinct but inter-related categories is an important first step toward building an effective
        marketing plan. The more you can coordinate and integrate your various marketing activities, the bigger the impact you'll have. For example, is how you
        talk about your services in person similar to what you say on your website? Does the feel of who you are and your personality come through in your
        marketing materials? This doesn't mean that you can't start marketing until you have it all complete and "perfect." No, just the opposite! Start with
        what you have now and build from there.
    </p>
    <p>
        A second step down the path toward effective marketing is to recognize and accept that marketing is a process, not a destination. Your marketing will
        evolve and grow over time - there is no "done" in the world of marketing but rather a pause between updates. This reality can be seen as both good and
        bad news. It's good news because nothing is set in concrete; it's all an experiment - so try something and see if it works. If it works - yea! If it
        doesn't - OK, let's try something different. Alternatively, you could perceive this continual evolution as bad news because it means that you're never
        "finished" with marketing. Just when you think you have the "perfect" materials and activities - poof! It may not work as well tomorrow. Something in
        the world has shifted and you need to move onto the next evolution of your marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
        My recommendation is to start with what's inside of you. In other words, don't spend time fussing over your business cards or external things. Instead
        focus on how you want to <em>be</em> with potential clients and referral sources-the impact you have, how you relate to others, the impression you
        leave behind. <strong>You </strong>are the core of your marketing-really! Your life purpose statement from the Coaching Process workshop will be a huge
        benefit in this process of self-discovery and awareness, as will the learnings from the CTI Leadership program.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two areas in marketing that are very rooted in who and how you are-enrollment and branding. I'd like to touch briefly on each to give you
        some initial direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enrollment is the art and skill of engaging and/or inspiring someone in a possibility for their lives. Enrollment is an advanced coaching skill. When
        practiced effectively, it can be the determining factor between having a fun-filled, thriving business and one that is full of angst and slow growth.
        Practicing enrollment effectively requires a level of sophistication that can be learned. Although enrollment is an art, rather than a science, we can
        still learn the distinguishing features, unlearn our disabling beliefs and evolve a powerful presence that brings enrollment into our conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key skills in enrollment is to be authentically interested in the other person. When you are truly interested in the person you're talking
        with, they will sense it and want to continue the conversation. If you can then effectively make the link between what they want in their lives and
        what you have to offer-bingo, that's enrollment at its best. No gimmicks, no manipulation, just great coaching skills. Practice sharing what you're
        passionate about with others. Then, when it comes to speaking about coaching, you'll be more confident in sharing this subject, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you gain experience in enrolling and working with clients, you can ask for feedback on your coaching style and unique contribution. Then you'll be
        ready to venture into the land of branding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually the word "branding" brings up images of well-known product brands such as Nike, Levi's and Volvo. However, let's look at the world of personal
        brands. What comes to mind when you think about Oprah? Donald Trump? Howard Stern? Could you confuse these three people with each other? No way! Each
        of these people has very distinct personal styles. Although you may not recognize this as branding-it is!
    </p>
    <p>
        What makes these brands so recognizable? No, it's not the hair (though that is part of it). It's the magic ingredients of clarity, consistency and
        integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you see Oprah-regardless of the situation-there is a clarity and consistency to her brand. There is a distinct "Oprah-ness" to her. Whatever words
        you might choose to describe her, they will be there each time you experience her. Plus, that "Oprah-ness" feel is found in many places-her looks, the
        graphics in her magazine, her choice of words and subjects. This is what makes her (and Donald and Howard and many other well-known figures) so
        memorable-the hallmark of an excellent brand.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how can we, as coaches, use this concept? No, we're not suggesting that you emulate Oprah! Instead, we recommend that you focus on the magic
        ingredients-clarity, consistency, and integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, how clear are you about what unique value you bring to your coaching relationships? What are your own unique characteristics? Through
        self-exploration and work with your coach, you will gain insight into the answers to these questions. Then look at how clearly and consistently you
        convey this to your potential clients and referral sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step is to get feedback from clients, friends, family and colleagues about how you are currently perceived. This allows you to become more
        aware of your desired impact contrasted with your actual impact. When you're able to align those two, you've got an effective brand!
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of where you begin your journey, keep the three golden rules in mind:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            There is no such thing as "perfect," so don't expect to create it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nothing is set in concrete, so start with what you have now and build from there.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work from the inside out-the clearer you are about yourself, the easier the rest of it will be.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I hope this helps you travel the roads of marketing!
    </p>
