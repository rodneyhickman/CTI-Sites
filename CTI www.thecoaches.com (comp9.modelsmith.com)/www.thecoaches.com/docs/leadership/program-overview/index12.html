							<h1 id="main-headline">Program Overview</h1>

							

							<p>If you want to have a more powerful, positive, and lasting impact within your organization, profession, family, and/or community, Co-Active Leadership training can help launch you into action.</p>

							

							<p>The training program encompasses four residential retreats held over a 10-month period, as well as in-between projects. It is designed to foster leadership potential and skills through the development of an international community of peers and leaders (approximately 23-24 participants per group) who grow and learn together through a variety of shared experiences.</p>

							

							<p>The program propels participants into understanding and accessing their unique strengths and personal power through participation in adventure-based activities, interactive exercises, spirited dialogue, ropes course challenges, and other group processes.</p>

							

							<p>Prior attendees have included individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, including coaches, consultants, executives, managers, entrepreneurs, engineers, <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>/<abbr title="Organization Development">OD</abbr> professionals, artists, writers, medical professionals, therapists, community leaders and many others.</p>

							

							<h2>Outcomes:</h2>

							

							<ul class="followsh2">

								<li>Recognize your personal leadership strengths and develop the capacity to be effective in a wide range of circumstances and environments</li>

								<li>Identify and break through self-perceived limits, thereby moving into an arena of extraordinary performance</li>

								<li>Perceive and build on the strengths inherent in others to create powerful alliances and achieve mutual goals</li>

								<li>Become aware of your impact on others, learn to create your desired impact and begin to take responsibility for that impact in all aspects of your life</li>

								<li>Know and directly experience the essential ingredients for designing and delivering effective experiential workshops, trainings and presentations</li>

								<li>Become a member of an international community of Leadership graduates</li>

							</ul>

							

							<h2>Pre-requisite</h2>

							

							<p>No pre-requisite is required for this course, although we highly recommend you attend <abbr title="Coaches Training Institute">CTI</abbr>'s Co-Active&#174; Fundamentals course prior to, or in conjunction with, this program.</p>

							

							<p>After completing your Leadership training, if you wish to continue your journey, you can do so by participating in the Leadership Mastery program.</p>

							

							<h2>Commitment</h2>

							

							<p>Participation in the Leadership program requires attendance at all four residential retreats, completion of homework projects and participation in regular conference calls (at least bi-weekly). Participants complete registration, medical and personal information forms prior to attending the first retreat and must be able to withstand the physical and emotional rigors of such a program. Retreat days are full, and group activities often continue into the evening hours. Accommodation has, and will be made for physical limitations to the extent possible. A physician's release may be required.</p>
