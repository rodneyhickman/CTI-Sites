								<h2>Program Information</h2>

								<dl class="bulleted-arrowed">

									<dt><a id="act-faq1" class="showdd">What is the Co-Active&#174; Leadership Program?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq1" class="faqdd">

										<p>The Co-Active Leadership Program is a powerful experiential program designed to uncover, deepen and build on your natural strengths as a leader. It consists of four intensive residential retreats and in-between assignments over a ten-month period.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq2" class="showdd">Who is this program for?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq2" class="faqdd">

										<p>This international program is designed for people who want to have a more powerful, positive and lasting impact within their profession, organization, family, and/or community and are ready to do something about it. The diversity of program participants enhances both its appeal and impact.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq3" class="showdd">How does this program differ from other personal and/or leadership development programs?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq3" class="faqdd">

										<p>In addition to its unique, Co-Active&#174; experiential learning model, this program stands out by continually deepening and integrating learning over a ten-month period, resulting in both personal mastery and the formation of a powerful leadership community that builds and sustains momentum over time.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq4" class="showdd">What are the physical requirements and can you accommodate limitations?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq4" class="faqdd">

										<p>As an experiential program, learning is often accomplished through moderate activity including movement, games, exercises, and various physical challenges. Course participants vary widely in both age and fitness levels however, and limitations can be accommodated without sacrificing learning. Safety is of utmost concern and everyone is encouraged to participate only to the extent to which they do not risk injuring themselves or others. A medical form completed at the time of registration, allows us to address any issues early on.</p>



									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq5" class="showdd">Why is the impact of this program so difficult for people to describe?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq5" class="faqdd">

										<p>As an experiential program, learning often happens through activities, games, and exercises designed to get the learning out of your head and deeply embedded in your body. As a result, the specific impact of learning is often difficult to describe in words.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq6" class="showdd">How has Leadership impacted participants' lives?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq6" class="faqdd">

										<p>The most universal participant feedback is that the Co-Active Leadership Program is 'life changing.' Specifically, graduates report that the program has most dramatically impacted their ability to access their personal strengths and leadership qualities, and apply them in all aspects of life, both personal and professional. They are more able to show up fully, take a stand for who they are and what they believe in, and take responsibility for the impact they create in the world. Graduates are also more attuned to the gifts of others and seek out opportunities to re-experience the joy of collaboration and co-creation.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq7" class="showdd">How time-intensive is this program? What are the expectations of participants between retreats?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq7" class="faqdd">

										<p>The program consists of 22 full training days spread over the four residential retreats, plus group interaction and projects scheduled between each retreat. Projects are designed by participants themselves, and vary widely in content, scope and time commitment. Retreat days often include structured activities into the evening hours. Participants remain connected with their leadership community through regular conference calls that take place at least bi-weekly, and via project work.</p>



									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq8" class="showdd">What's next after completing Leadership?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq8" class="faqdd">

										<p>At the completion of this program you will become part of the international leadership community of graduates, The CALL, that provides ongoing opportunities for growth, connection, networking/resource sharing, and keeping the learning alive. </p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq9" class="showdd">Can I receive continuing education hours for this program?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq9" class="faqdd">

										<p>The International Coaches Federation (ICF) has approved the Co-Active Leadership Program for 199.75 hours of Continuing Coaching Education. We will provide a certificate of completion and supporting information for participants who are interested in pursuing continuing education units with other professional associations.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq10" class="showdd">Will I be at a disadvantage if I don't have any coach training?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq10" class="faqdd">

										<p>While many Leadership participants do have coach training and therefore a similar frame of reference when they begin the program, this is not a coaching course and prior coach training in not essential to successfully complete this program. We do however, recommend that participants without other CTI training become familiar with Co-Active principles by reading the book, Co-Active Coaching , by Laura Whitworth, Henry Kimsey-House, Karen Kimsey-House and Phil Sandahl. This book will provide you with the basic language and understanding of the Co-Active model, which applies to leadership as well as coaching.</p>

									</dd>



								</dl>



								<h2>Leadership and Coaching</h2>

								<dl class="bulleted-arrowed">

									<dt><a id="act-faq11" class="showdd">How is this program related to Co-Active coaching?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq11" class="faqdd">

										<p>The Co-Active framework was developed by the three CTI co-founders, Laura Whitworth, Henry Kimsey-House and Karen Kimsey-House. It holds that all people are naturally creative, resourceful and whole, and forms the basis for creating collaborative, proactive alliances. This framework applies to leadership development as well as coach training. Skills and techniques are important in both our leadership development and coach training programs - authenticity and connection are even more important.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq12" class="showdd">How will Leadership help my coaching?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq12" class="faqdd">

										<p>Through Leadership you will develop a wider range of self-expression, the flexibility to dance with whatever shows up in the moment and the strength to stand in your power -  regardless of the circumstances. This in turn, enhances your ability to be fully present with and take a stand for your clients.</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq13" class="showdd">Should I take Leadership or Certification first; or take them simultaneously?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq13" class="faqdd">

										<p>The answer to this question is highly individual, and we'd be happy to explore this with you over the phone. Some questions to consider include: What are you up to in the world right now? Is your goal to be a full-time coach or use coaching skills in other work that you do? What are your time, family, work, and/or financial constraints? Do you like to be busy or need time to process information?</p>

									</dd>



									<dt><a id="act-faq14" class="showdd">Is Leadership required to become a CTI course leader?</a></dt>

									<dd id="ct-faq14" class="faqdd">

										<p>Successful completion of the Co-Active Leadership program is one of the pre-requisites to becoming a CTI front-of-the-room leader for the coaching curriculum. Completing Leadership does not guarantee that you will be hired as a Co-Active Leader&#174; however, as a rigorous front-of-the-room interviewing process is also required.</p>
