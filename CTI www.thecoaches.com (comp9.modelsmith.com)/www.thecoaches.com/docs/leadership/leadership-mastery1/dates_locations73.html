<b>Almiral de la Font</b>
 
Sitges, Spain
(Barcelona Airport)
 
Leaders: Karen and Henry Kimsey-House

Almiral de la Font: <a target="_blank" href="http://almiraldelafont.com/">almiraldelafont.com</a>
 
Almiral de la Font is a luxuriously restored masia just
south of Barcelona. Staying at Almiral is a unique
experience: renovated with great care and attention
to detail, this beautiful ‘masia’ (Catalan manor house),
offers high-tech modern comforts whilst retaining the
historic charm and character of the original building.
                                                  
Set high on a hillside in the Pinedes wine region, the masia is surrounded
by the Garaf National Park and offers dramatic sea or mountain views
from every room or terrace.  This tranquil haven has more than 300
acres of private grounds with vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees, yet
is only a 30 minute drive from Barcelona and 10 minutes from the lively
beach resort of Sitges.
