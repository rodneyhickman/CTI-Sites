    <h1>Coaching Supervision Overview</h1>
    <p>Many coaching students consider supervision one of the most useful components of their coach training because it is individualized and tailored to your specific learning needs and learning style. Supervision is like having a personal trainer alongside you as you sculpt, tone and strengthen your Co-Active coaching skills. </p>
	<p>Your supervisors are highly experienced CPCCs, who are passionate about coaching and honored to usher you through this stage of your coach training journey. Your supervisor is your partner and guide whose primary focus is your growth and development as a coactive coach.  Your supervisors look forward to engaging with you in this process. Your enthusiastic participation in your supervision process will extend your reach and expand your range as a Co-Active coach.</p>
	<p>You will schedule (3) supervision sessions between March and May with your supervisor, each session is one hour long.  Before each supervison, you will need to record a coaching session to share with your supervisor.</p>
	<p>You will find your supervisor's contact information and scheduling suggestions in this <a href="pdfs/NG-Supervision-Assign-V1-03.doc">downloadable Word doc</a>. Please review the information below to prepare for supervisions.</p>
	
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">What you will need for each supervision call</h1>
    <p>To maximize the value of your supervision calls you should meet with your client for at least two sessions before you begin recording for the purpose of supervision and do not bring recordings of sessions that are structured coaching techniques (e.g., Discovery Session, Future Self, Wheel of Life). Keep a log or journal of your learning from each supervision. </p>
    
    <p>Prior to each supervision call you will need to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Schedule a time with your supervisor</li>
      <li>Select a client with whom you have established a relationship</li>
      <li>Have the client <a href="pdfs/NG _ClientReleaseForm.pdf">sign a release form</a>.</li>
      <li>Record a coaching session (see procedure below)</li>
      <li>Test the recording to make sure it worked and is clear. (an inaudible recording is considered as a supervision rescheduled with less than 24 hours notice)</li>
      <li>Email the recording to your supervisor at least 48 hours prior to your supervision appointment (You may send your email up to 1 week prior to your appointment)</li>
      <li>Have your <a href="pdfs/NG-Sup-Review-V2.pdf">Supervision Review Sheet</a> handy. (You will need to complete page 1 before your first call.)</li>
      </ol>
    <p>*Note: When you have completed your supervision, it is your responsibility to destroy the recording of the coaching session in your possession.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">On your first Supervision call – Design your Alliance</h1>
    <p>Plan to spend a few extra minutes on your first supervision call designing your alliance with your
      supervisor. Your <a href="pdfs/NG-Sup-Review-V2.pdf">Supervision Review Sheet</a> lists some suggested areas to cover in your design. 
      Remember that this is YOUR designed alliance with your supervisor, so create the relationship
      that will best support your learning. This first call is also your opportunity to design the kind of
      feedback you want to receive, and to ask your supervisor any questions that you may have
      about supervision. You and your supervisor can make changes in your designed alliance at any
      time during the supervision process.</p>

    <p>Although your supervisors are highly experienced coaches, their role in supervision is to provide expert feedback. This supervision role is quite different than a coach’s role. Your supervisors are eager to support you in your learning. Because it is so direct and so
      specific, the supervision process can sometimes be challenging to adult learners. The intent and
      purpose of the supervision component of your program is to support you in becoming the best
      Co-Active coach you can be. We ask that you continue to develop your ability to listen at Level 2
      and Level 3 and that you receive your supervision feedback in that context. Your supervisor’s
      expert opinion is just that, an expert opinion. Take in the information and feedback that is useful
      to you, and let go of the rest.</p>
      
      <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Recording your Calls</h1>
    <p>You will be choosing one of the following two options to record your calls. The first is a phone recording service called Audio Acrobat and the other option is to use a digital recorder <strong>and then send the file using the file transfer service You Send it from home.</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Note: Please get yourself set up and try recording a session before your Balance course on 2/10</strong> so that we can answer any questions you have about recording calls at the course. Follow the instructions below to test your desired procedure before you try recording with your client. <em>Please be sure to see below for our tips on achieving a clear recording</em> </p>

                                      <p><strong>Note: If you are doing your coaching session in person</strong> and wish to use Audio Acrobat, you can record a live conversation using a microphone hooked up to your computer.

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase a digital recorder that records using MP3 format and test the sound quality.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Follow the instructions included with your digital recorder to download the recording to your home computer. You must send the file from your home – due to the firewall restrictions.<br />

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Register for a <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/" target="_blank">You Send It</a> account. (You Send It is an online service that makes it possible to transfer large files and bypass email size limitations.) A free lite account should be sufficient for the purposes of supervison.<br />

<strong>Step 4:</strong> Login to your You Send It account and send the mp3 file to your email to try out using You Send It.  The process is pretty simple, just click the “Send” tab once you are logged in then click “Send File” in the menu. On the send file screen, enter the destination email, subject line, attach the file and click “Send It”. It will cost you a small fee if you want to add password protection or tracking.<br />

<strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you have tried out the process you are ready to record a coaching session. After your coaching session, download and test your recorded audio and email it to your supervisor. (Please send the link to your supervisor at least 48 hours prior to your appointment. You can send it as early as 1 week prior if you wish.)</p>

 	<h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">General Tips for Getting Clear Recordings</h1>
    <p>High-quality recordings of your coaching sessions will add value to your supervision experience. When your recording is clear and easy to hear, your supervisor can give their full attention to listening to your coaching and giving you feedback. </p>

	<p>If your recording is inaudible or cannot be understood, the Supervision may need to be rescheduled, incurring additional costs.</p> 

	<p>Equipment failure happens often, so please record all coaching sessions for which you have permission. These recordings will give you more learning experiences to choose from</p>

	<p>Here are some tips for high-quality recordings:<br />
	<ol>

<li>VOX (Voice Activation feature on many recording devices) must be turned OFF to make a high-quality Supervision recording.</li>

<li>If you are recording a telephone session, use a landline, not a mobile telephone. Make sure there are no background noises while you are recording.</li>

<li>If you are recording an in-person session, hold your session indoors, in a quiet, private environment with no background noise. You must use equipment designed for recording two people speaking. Test your equipment ahead of time with another person, in the coaching space. Pay particular attention to the volume setting and location of your microphones, since microphones will sometimes pick up background noise, or they will pick up one voice clearly and not the other.</li>
