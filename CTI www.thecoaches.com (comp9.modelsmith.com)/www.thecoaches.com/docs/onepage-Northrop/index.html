    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your Internal Co-Active Coaching program with the Coaches Training Institute. You are embarking on an important learning process that will impact your capacity to bring forward the best talent in all of your people. The program includes an integrated set of components to foster your learning, provide you with a direct experience of coaching, and support you in bringing new skills directly to your role in the company. Your full engagement in this learning process can dramatically alter your capacity to bring out the best in those you work with.</p>
	<p>The program components are described below.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Experiential Workshops <span class="h2detail">Four 3-day in person experiential workshops</span></h1>
    <p>Learning coaching skills is much like learning golf or tennis; Theory and principles are helpful but it takes practice and feedback to become proficient. During the session you will spend about 75% of the time practicing in a variety of formats that includes pairs, triads, small groups, and whole group exercises. There is no role playing per se, when you are practicing, you use real situations that you face at work or at home.</p>

    <p>This online resource provides soft copy of all the forms in the Internal Co-Active Coaches Toolkit found in your participant manual. Some of the learning labs will refer to the toolkit. In addition, this may be a valuable resource during your coaching practice.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Learning Labs <span class="h2detail">Six 60 minute learning labs conducted as tele-classes</span></h1>
    <p>Your group will be divided into two learning groups or “pods” that will have a monthly 60 minute learning lab call for six months, and a final call for the whole group focused on exam preparation. All of the labs will be on CTI’s bridgeline number, which you should have received.</p>
    <p><em>Participation in five of the six learning labs is required.  Generally, participants should attend the call scheduled for their pod – and only if necessary can switch to another pod call.</em></p>

	<h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Individual Coaching <span class="h2detail">Four hours of 1:1 coaching with a CTI Leader</span></h1>
    <p>You will receive a total of four hours of coaching with a CTI Leader during the first four months of the program.  The individual coaching is intended to support your learning in the program, to model effective coaching skills, and provide general value through coaching.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Coaching Triads</h1>
    <p>Between the first and second workshops of the program you will be practicing coaching in assigned triads in preparation for the one-on-one coaching practice outlined in the paragraph below.  Your triads will meet for an hour every other week for a total of least three meetings between October 9th and December 2nd.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Coaching Practice<span class="h2detail">36 hours of coaching practice</span></h1>
    <p>You are required to complete a minimum of 36 hours of actual one-on-one coaching practice either with colleagues in the program or voluntary clients from the organization. Learning “triads” will be established during the first course to begin this process on a peer-peer basis.  By month 3 of the program, you should be coaching a minimum of 3 (we recommend 5) actual internal clients for minimum 2 hours/month each – 4 hrs preferred.  John Sullivan will be sending you your assigned practice clients.</p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;"><a href="cert.html" style="font-weight: normal; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Certification Supervision/Feedback</a><span class="h2detail">Three one-on-one coaching supervision sessions</span></h1>
    <p>You will receive three certification supervision/feedback calls between March and May.  The certification supervision/feedback calls are opportunities for you to listen to one of your recorded practice client coaching sessions with a CTI Supervisor and receive specific feedback on the application of skills.  You will be provided real-time feedback on a 30 minute recorded coaching session that you bring to the call.  The first 30 minutes will be listening to the session and the 2nd 30 minutes will be feedback.  You will need to arrange recording of the session ahead of time.  Instructions will be sent to you on how to manage this in a later communication. <a href="cert.html">Click here for detailed instructions on Supervision.</a></p>
    
    <h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">Oral and Written Exam</h1>
    <p>At the end of your program there will be both a written and oral exam to evaluate your coaching skills.  The written exam will be administered through email in May and the oral exam will be done over the phone with a qualified CTI examiner in June and July.  You will receive instructions about this process later on in the program.</p>
