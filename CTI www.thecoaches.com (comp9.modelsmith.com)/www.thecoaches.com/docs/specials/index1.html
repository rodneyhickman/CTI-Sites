								<p>Leadership - Why Now?</p>

								

								<p>If you want to have a more powerful, positive and lasting impact within your organization, profession, family or community, the Co-active Leadership Program can help launch you into action.</p>

								

								<p>Consider this.</p>

								

								<p>Only two Northern California programs remain open between now and September.   While our beautiful California weather rolls through into the Indian Summer of Autumn, take advantage of the few remaining seats that are still available.  These openings will not last long.</p>

								

								<p>Availability won't last!</p>

								

								<p>Northern California beginning April 28:  over half full<br/>

								Northern California beginning May 26:   over half full</p>

								

								<p>For immediate reservations in either of these programs, please contact Debra Martin, <abbr title="Certified Professional Co-Active Coach">CPCC</abbr> directly at 415.526.1633 or at 800.691.6008, <abbr title="extension">xtn.</abbr> 633.</p>

								

								<p>For a full program schedule on these programs, <a href="/leadership/dates-and-locations/">click here</a></p>

							<blockquote>

								<p>&quot;I came home...realizing that I was never, ever going to be able to see myself as small again. Every day I make decisions in my life that I make differently because I went through the Leadership program. The impact on my life was profound and in the five years since, it has not let up. You keep on learning because you are open to seeing that you really are at choice about your life.&quot;</p>

							<blockquote>

								<p>&quot;Leadership for me was like a portal - once through, the world looks different - more colors, more textures and clarity. The changes in me have been profound. I am living an authentic life, living my values, taking risks ... I know so much more of who I <abbr lang="la" title="Ante Meridiem">am</abbr> as a unique being.&quot;</p>
