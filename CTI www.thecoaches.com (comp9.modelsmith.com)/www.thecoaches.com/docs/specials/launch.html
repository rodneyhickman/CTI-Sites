            LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT</span></p>

          <p class="style84"><br />
            Hello Friends,</p>
          
          <p class="style70">Through your coaching course work, I trust you know that CTI is dedicated to your success in every way. That&#146;s why I&#146;m very excited to announce the launch of a new CTI program, <strong>Breakaway Marketing for Coaching</strong>, and to invite you to our initial pilot here in the Bay Area on<strong> August 14 and 15</strong>.</p>
          <p class="style70">Over the past years, I&#146;ve spoken with many CTI students about what they need to ensure business success as a Co-Active Coach. What they&#146;ve told me over and over again is that they want a proven, up-to-date, no-nonsense approach offered by marketing professionals and presented in a way that is experiential and fun. So, in partnership with a top-notch marketing company, we&#146;ve created <strong>Breakaway Marketing for Coaching</strong> to bring you the most effective techniques for business success in today&#146;s changing market.</p>

          <p class="style70">For the August pilot, we&#146;re offering a special price of <strong>only $450</strong>. After the pilot, the tuition for the course will be $895. At this price, space will go quickly so you&#146;ll want to call CTI right way at <strong>1.800.691.6008</strong> to grab a spot.</p>
          <p class="style70"><strong>Breakaway Marketing for Coaching</strong> is designed to capitalize on the great coaching training you received from CTI. It&#146;s co-led and interactive with lots of hands-on learning, as well being packed full with up-to-date information and tools that you can begin using right away. In this two-day course, you will:</p>
          <ul class="style70">
          <li class="style82">Create a custom-designed marketing plan for your coaching business.</li>
    <li class="style82">Develop the skills and tools needed to implement that plan successfully.</li>

          <li class="style82">Learn how to get new clients right away.</li>
    <li class="style82">Discover specific strategies to engage visitors on your website.</li>
    <li class="style82">Learn how social networking on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter can bring in new business.</li>
  </ul>
       
          <p class="style70">At the end of the course, we&#146;ll be asking you for your input, so you&#146;ll have an opportunity to contribute to the future design and success of the program as well.</p>
<p class="style70">Market OUT LOUD specializes in marketing for small businesses and has worked with more than 2,400 entrepreneurs, many coaches just like you, to build business success.</p>
          <p class="style70">With the launch of Breakaway, it&#146;s our intention for CTI to be the very best place to learn the skills <em>and</em> business of coaching. Please join us in our commitment to your accelerating success and growth!</p>
