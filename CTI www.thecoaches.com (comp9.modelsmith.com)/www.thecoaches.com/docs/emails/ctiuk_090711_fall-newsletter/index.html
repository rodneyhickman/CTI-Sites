However, this is less a departure from providing information about what’s happening in the UK to UK-based graduates of CTI’s programs, and more a move to celebrate what’s universal about the Co-Active experience.</p>

									<p>Regardless of culture or race, the experience of Co-Activity reveals we are all hungry for the same thing; to be more authentic, more intimate, and more conscious in our relationships with others. Our local experience of connecting with others is shared globally. That’s what makes the experience of Co-Active coaching so powerful, and so it’s our hope that by sharing news and stories from the global Co-Active community via a global newsletter, that experience will be enhanced.</p>
									
									<p>To set the tone for this, in this final ‘local’ UK edition of the newsletter, we have news from Hide Enomoto’s 311 Co-Active Response to the Fukushima disaster earlier this year, as well as news of the forthcoming European Co-Active Coaching Community day. Elsewhere, you’ll find Nick Martin’s lucid description of the underpinning philosophy of CTI’s Leadership Circle Profile program, and a Q and A with the inspirational Art Shirk about the Co-Active Leadership program. Art, who will be leading the forthcoming Leadership program in Spain this November, has a deft touch in describing the subtle difference between Co-Active coaching and Co-Active leadership, so be sure to keep this valuable learning resource.</p>
									
									<p>Wherever you are in your personal development or career as a coach, we hope to see you soon on one of our courses.</p>

												<p>Dear Friends,</p>
												
												<p>I noticed that it has been a while since I wrote about what’s happening in Japan. As I mentioned in my last email to you, we have started a project called “Project 311” and have sent out a call to our graduates to work together with us on supporting the tsunami survivors through a volunteer organization.</p>
												
											</td>

									</table>
									<p>Many graduates responded to our call, and, along with many of our Faculty members, they have been offering their time, their energy, and most importantly their heart in order to support the tsunami survivors in rediscovering their strength they innately possess and restoring their life and their land.</p>
									
									<p>Last Wednesday, those of us who have been engaged in this project held a conversation circle and shared with each other what we felt and what we discovered by being up there supporting the tsunami survivors. Below are some of the things that were shared in the circle:</p>
												
									<ul>
										<li>In most areas, people are moving from the shelters to the temporal housings. While they are relieved to regain privacy, many are finding it challenging as they are cut off from the government support once they have moved to the temporal housings. In addition, now with some private space, people are finally getting in touch with their deep pain of losing so much (family members, home, money, job and so on) all at once. The psychological support including coaching will be needed even more from this point on. It will be a long haul.<br /><br /></li>
										
										<li>The volunteers come from wide range of backgrounds and while their intention is good-willed, their skills and attitudes in dealing with the tsunami survivors are inefficient and sometimes does harm. It seems that there are many ways we as Co-Active Coaches can help in closing this gap; for example, by offering short lectures/workshops to the volunteers.<br /><br /></li>
										
										<li>The Co-Active Way has been very helpful for us in dealing with both the tsunami survivors and the volunteers. When, for example, tsunami survivors are expressing their deep pain, the best gift we can offer is just to be with them and hold them naturally creative, resourceful and whole. At the same time, this project is calling us forth to embody the Co-Active Way ever more deeply, rather than just applying the skills and principles of Co-Active Coaching.<br /><br /></li>
									</ul>
								
									<p>We intend to continue with this project and enroll more people into it. And, there is something you can help us in doing that; we have set up a bank account and started accepting donations specifically for this project. One of the ways in which we are planning to use the money being donated is to support the coaches who are wanting to contribute their time, energy and heart to this project, but do not have enough financial resources to keep traveling to the Tohoku area (i.e. the round trip cost from Tokyo to Tohoku costs more than 300 USD by train!). </p>

									<h2 class="orange" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight:normal; line-height: 21px;">What kind of leader are you?</h2>
									<p><strong>By Nick Martin. MSc, CPCC</strong></p>
									
									<p>At the Co-Active Summit in Florida earlier this year, Karen and Henry Kimsey-House talked about the need for an evolutionary leap in human consciousness. We are approaching a chasm in our development as a species. Many of us are not aware that we are approaching this chasm. Others are aware, but prefer to pretend it is not happening, because it is too scary, because it does not fit with their current way of thinking / living / working or with the vested interests of the organization they work for. Others are aware and, even in the face of ambiguity and uncertainty, are beginning to prepare themselves.</p>

									<p>In their book “Immunity to Change”, Robert Kegan and Lisa Laskow Lahey describe three levels of development of the human mind—socialized, self-authoring, and self-transforming.</p>
									
									<p>At the socialized level, we have an externally-referenced sense of value and worth as human beings, derived from the opinions of others. We follow other people, for example our boss or our parents, and seek direction and guidance from them. We behave in a way that we believe fits in with what other people want. We tell people what we think they want to hear, rather than telling them what we really think. We filter the messages we receive from them through all sorts of assumptions.</p>
									
									<p>At the self-authoring level, our sense of value and self-worth is internally referenced. Whatever the opinions of other people, we know that we have value and worth. As a result we are more independent, more grounded, and more resilient. We know what we want—we know our vision, our strategy, and our plans. We are able to communicate them to other people, and we are also able to receive information that we have asked for that is relevant to our vision, etc. However, our filter may mean that we risk missing information that does not appear to be directly relevant.</p>
									
									<p>At the self-transforming level, we are aware of our filters, and are able to look at them, and not just through them. We know that any one point of view may be flawed, and we actively look for other ways of interpreting it. As Kegan and Lahey say, we know that what made sense today may not make sense tomorrow. The self-authoring mind will single-mindedly pursue its plan. The self-transforming mind wants to ensure that its plan is inclusive, and up-to-date. This means that it is open to information that may at first sight seem irrelevant, but in fact could be vital to the success of the plan. The self-transforming mind is able to hold paradox. One difference between the self-authoring leader and the self-transforming leader is in the sort of questions they ask. The self-authoring leader might ask, “What do I need?”, whereas the self-transforming leader is more likely to ask, “What is needed here?”</p>
									
									<p>The socialized mind follows other people’s plans. The self-authoring mind has its own plans, communicates them, and looks for idea to support them. The self-transforming mind also has it own plans, and also looks for ideas that challenge them. Kegan and Lahey use the metaphor of driving. The socialized mind wants to get in the back of the car and be driven; the self-authoring mind wants to get behind the wheel and drive the car; and the self-transforming mind wants to send and receive information not just in order to be able to drive, but also to redraw the map or challenge the direction.</p> 
									
									<p>The Leadership Circle Profile (TLCP) is a 360° feedback instrument that, amongst other things, explores our “Reactive Tendencies” and our “Creative Competencies”. There is a relationship between the dimensions measured by TLCP and the levels of development described by Kegan and Lahey. Are you effective at achieving results, or does excessive caution slow you down? Do you engage in productive discussion with others, or do you withdraw in order to protect yourself? Do you motivate people and align them to create results with you, or do you use aggressiveness to get your way? The Leadership Circle can provide answers to these, and many other, questions. Not only that, but in addressing itself to the self-transforming mind, it will lead you to plenty more questions of your own.</p>

												<p><strong>We tend to view leaders as people who take us somewhere, a path finder, who sees a possible future, and then inspires us to follow him or her, there—usually in the straightest and shortest line possible. How does CTI’s vision of how leaders act in the world, differ from this? Is it similarly linear?</strong></p>

									<p>There are aspects of Co-Active Leadership that are similar to this idea, and some that differ. Co-Active Leaders are path finders. They do see possible futures that are aligned with a deep sense of purpose, and certainly they do create impact, including mobilizing others around their vision. There are some important distinctions, though, about a CO-ACTIVE leader, and about Co-Active Leadership. In my opinion, the most important thing is that a Co-Active Leader is intimately connected to others and to the world around them, and is creating FROM that connection and relationship. Rather than having an individual vision and striving to make others follow their path in as direct way as possible, a Co-Active Leader is engaging others in that vision and has the capacity to actually create that vision FROM the world around them. It is a “level 1”, “level 2”, and “level 3” phenomenon all at the same time. </p>
												
									<p>As a Co-Active Leader, the path I am creating does have roots in my own sense of who I am and my purpose, but it comes alive when I can also create it from my relationship with others and from my deeply connected sense of what the world around me needs and wants. The other distinction that I see is that in my opinion “leadership” is not just about a person and his or her capabilities or actions to lead others, it is a process that happens among people and in the world, or, unfortunately, doesn’t happen. So, in a sense, Co-Active Leaders are able to create leadership from what is happening around them, all of the time. It is a way of being in the world that, once turned on, doesn’t turn off very easily.</p>  
											
									<p><strong>The Co-Active Leadership model’s invitation to lead from those essential qualities which make you unique, seems to invite a much wider range of leadership styles than we might be used to. How does that play out in the real world, where our expectations of leaders to demonstrate certain virtues, such as charisma, and great oratory, are still so high?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Well, a few decades ago, the idea that there is a single set of leadership attributes and competencies that were the “right” set, was the predominant way of thinking. While there are a set of competencies and skills that we know are most critical for effective leadership, when we begin to talk about attributes, it is more effective for a leader to express him or herself AUTHENTICALLY, than to try to fit into a prescribed box of how they should be.</p> 

<p>We go through much of life learning to “be” a certain right way: to be smart; to be strong; to be assertive; to be “professional”, and for much of our careers those things may serve us well and contribute to success. However, we reach a point in our development when an awareness begins to emerge that a more essential and authentic part of ourselves has been missing, or hasn’t been fully expressed, and, it wants to be! I believe, and part of the Co-Active Leadership philosophy is, that within each leader resides an authentic being, a true and essential way of expressing itself, that wants room to move. </p>

<p>Leaders who have the courage and confidence and self-knowledge to be themselves authentically, and to use those authentic strengths, have greater impact in creating the results that they want. My goal in the first retreat of the program is for every single person to uncover more of that authentic leader inside and give it room to move.</p>

									<p><strong>In what way can Co-Active Leadership empower our ability to co-lead with others, either a partner, or other members of a group? And what impact can this have on the people we are hoping to lead?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>It’s a great question. Often after a CTI Co-Active Coaching course, people will say things like “There is something special about the way the course leaders worked together. What is it?”</p>
									
									<p>A key answer to that question is that the training the course leaders have in common is the Co-Active Leadership Program. The original intent of the Program when it was created many years ago was to build the skill of co-leading, of leading with another person or people in front of a room or group. Since that original design, the Program has grown, deepened, and been re-designed various times and its purpose and impact today goes way beyond that.</p> 
									
									<p>However, for me this question is a bit like when a coaching student asks if a Co-Active Coaching course will teach them how to use coaching skills? Of course, the answer is yes, it does that, but really that is almost a “small a” agenda. The real intent and impact of the program is that it builds the capacity in just about any situation to create intentional impact with anyone—including but not at all limited to a co-leader—that is aligned to a clear sense of purpose and intention.</p>
									
									<p>Before growing my Co-Active Leadership muscles, I often found myself feeling like “it was all up to me”. That the success of my efforts would depend on my expertise, my qualifications, my polish. One of the biggest impacts for me personally was learning that I am NEVER alone as a leader. I am always leading within a context, within a space (or field, or energy) and I am always leading in relationship with other people. Once I truly understood that, I found that most often the answers (or solutions or direction) already exist in others and in the space. “Leading” became more fun and more effective, and my impact became much more potent.</p>
																		
									<p><strong>The names of CTI’s Leadership retreats: ‘Create From’ self, other, nothing, everything – makes clear that leaders have more than just themselves to work with, but what exactly do Co-Active leaders actually ‘Create’?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>We use that phrase “create from” very intentionally, and it is a core aspect of Co-Active Leadership. Hmmm, it is a bit tricky to explain. It is very much like an internal muscle or awareness that grows and expands the more it is nurtured, and it is a capability that really is quite revolutionary, it dramatically alters one’s capacity to lead.</p>
									<p>First of all, consider the word “create”, and think of the energy of creativity. It means to bring something into being that didn’t exist before. It comes from intention, from pro-action, from love and from passion. It is a very positive energy, and stands in contrast to “react”. So, the first part is about creativity and having the capacity to “bring things into being” that weren’t there before.</p>
									
									<p>The other part, the “from” is essential, and stands in contrast to “to” as in “do to.” When I create FROM something, that something is a rich resource for me. It is gas in the engine. It is something that I am connected to which actually becomes part of me. In Co-Active Leadership our starting point is “creating from” our most authentic selves, all of the natural strengths, gifts, talents, wisdom that we already have as unique individuals. But, that is just the starting point. When we “create from OTHER” it means that others around us—our family members, our team, our students—are resources that we are intimately connected to and we can draw on THEIR gifts, talents, wisdom, and so forth.</p>
									<p>This may sound simple, but is quite a radical shift for many leaders. If I am always able to create from others, it means that I am NEVER alone, and NEVER need to rely only on my own ability. Thank goodness!</p>
									
									<p>The most impactful and revolutionary parts of Co-Active Leadership for me, however, come from building a consciousness of what it means to create from “NOTHING” and from “EVERYTHING”. Don’t tell anyone, but I would say that these are actually two perspectives on the same thing. The profound point, though, is that when I allow myself to become present and connecting to all that is around me and to the depths of my intuitive self at a very essential level, I have access to a tremendous wealth of resources. And, the really great news is that I discover that EVERYTHING around me is a valuable resource, including what often seem like obstacles, opposition, conflict, or difficulty. When people really grasp this concept, they begin to “dance with everything” as leaders, meaning they become very nimble and adept at leading fluidly with whatever comes their way. I could go on and on, on this topic. It is the single most profound concept that changed my life as a leader.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>In what way does Co-Active Leadership empower participants to work directly with the chaos and mess, like that presented by the natural disasters, financial crises, environmental meltdown and war, we find in the world today?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>“Creating from Everything” is our theme in the fourth retreat of the program. By that we mean growing the ability to “dance” with whatever shows up, including the unexpected chaos and mess. A fundamental shift in stance happens. Rather than ignore, push away, resist, work-around, or avoid the “mess” that is happening, Co-Active Leadership teaches how to “create from” it. It is creative stance that embraces whatever is happening in the moment. And, according to my purpose or intention, giving myself full permission to take action in my own unique way to have the impact that I want.</p>
									
									<p>As I write this answer, I think of our colleague Kyoko Seiki in Japan—who is a phenomenal Co-Active Leader—and her response after the earthquake and tsumani in Japan several months ago. What I was struck by was her PRESENCE to what was happening around her, her ability to deeply sense what was happening, and her keen awareness of her leadership instincts and purpose in that situation. In the midst of very tragic and chaotic circumstances, she was able to stay tuned to her own inner compass and at the same time to all that was going on around her, and to create from all of that to have a positive impact in her community.</p>
									
									<p>So, to answer the question more directly, I think that Co-Active Leadership supports our sense of purpose, our capacity to be present and aware, and to take full action even in the midst of what seem like chaos.</p>
									
									<p><strong>How can the Co-Active Leadership impact our personal lives, with our loved ones for the better? Feel free to speak from personal experience.</strong></p>
									
									<p>My participation in the Co-Active Leadership program in 2001 was the catalyst that opened up a very different trajectory in my life. It is why I can speak so passionately about it and lead the program with a very personal and heartfelt conviction that it can be a major influence in people’s lives.</p>
									
									<p>Part of Co-Active Leadership is about intimacy, and the capacity to open one’s heart to another, to really let them in, as well as to take the vulnerable risk of entering into their hearts such as the transformation that happened in my relationship with my Dad. After Retreat 2 of the Program, I remember having some time with my Dad, and noticing that I was able to see him, to feel him, in a more present way and more as a human being than I had been able to before. It showed up in seemingly small ways, like simply being able to listen to him and hear him without a lot of “inner noise” or judgment going on my head.</p>
									
									<p>And so, I began to respond to him differently, more openly, and I discovered that we began to know each other more deeply, and we began to give ourselves permission to simply love each other more than we had before. He passed away just over three years ago at the age of 91, and I feel so, so very grateful to have built what was a profoundly loving relationship with him.</p>
									
									<p>While there are many, many “professional” benefits of Co-Active Leadership, in the end I believe it is on the personal level that that the most profound rewards appear. Looking back on life it will have been my capacity to love and be loved that will ultimately matter.</p>
									
									<p><strong>CTI’s Leadership Program brings together 22 people into a ‘tribe’ who will live together for 22 days spread out over 4 retreats, over 10 months, with many hours also spent together in-between retreats, virtually on the phone and online. In what way is the idea of the tribe living and learning together in this way so important to the success of the course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>We make the promise to participants that they will have an experience of community that will change their life, and we mean it. This aspect of the program is essential for several reasons, and has great long-term benefits as well. It is essential because the community or “tribe” as we call it forms a very solid “learning container” for the program over the 10 month period. Everyone who is there has deep desire and very high hopes and dreams for what will happen, and brings a very high level of commitment to the process.</p>
									<p>It is an environment of both challenge and support. Everyone is counting on everyone else to be there to challenge and support them and everyone knows that they are being counted on just as much. Of course, most people start out with some anxiety about how they will show up in this new community, but the thing is that everyone feels that to some degree, everyone is “in the same boat,” and it does not take long for the willingness to experiment, try new things, fail, stretch, recover and try again, to blossom. It is truly the most exciting, loving, fun, and challenging learning environment that I’ve had the privilege to be a part of.</p>
									
									<p>The community is also essential because it provides a real laboratory for everyone. Just as in a coaching workshop participants are coaching one another, in the Leadership Program you are always having an impact and leading others in the community. It is your practice field for 10 months. I have been involved with more than ten tribes over the years. The most gratifying results actually show up long after the program has ended, when I learn of projects that get launched years later by members of a Tribe together, but that had its original seed in the Leadership Program. Many people come out of the Program with life-long friends who are also allies and supporters from all around the Globe.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>As a leader of the Co-Active Leadership program, which powerful questions would you invite someone who’s procrastinating about whether to take the program, to consider, to help them determine if now is the right time?</strong></p>
									
									<p>That’s an important question because I actually discourage people from doing the program if it is not right for them, or not the right time for them. I want people to participate in the program when they know in their heart of hearts that it is the right thing and the right time. My guidance for that is to listen to the deepest, most knowing part of yourself and notice the difference between what the logical mind has to say, and the deeper voice. The powerful questions would be: What do you already know? What does your heart tell you? Look for the voice inside that is hungry for something, is it hungry? What does it want? Listen to that voice and if it is saying yes, and now, but has lots of fears and concerns, get support around those, but put yourself into the process. Everyone arrives at the program very nervous and apprehensive. That’s a good thing. They soon discover that there are 20 other hungry souls who are also a bit scared of what is to come, and it creates a very powerful container for transformation.</p>
