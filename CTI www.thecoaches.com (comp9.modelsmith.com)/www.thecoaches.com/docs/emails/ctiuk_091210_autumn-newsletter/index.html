									<p><strong>Welcome to CTI UK’s Autumn Newsletter.</strong></p>
									<p>After the summer holiday months have passed, September as Harvest time, naturally invites a time of review. It may sound like a clich&eacute;, and yet it’s true.</p>
									<p>Autumn naturally invites this way of thinking because we know the end of the year is coming soon and yet that there is still enough time to take action to correct our course. </p>
									
									<p>However, assessing our current situation is not always as easy. Even if we have the tools about how to see the way ahead, we may find ourselves scared to step forward with positive action. </p>
									
									<p>Finding new perspectives to make more informed and powerful choices in our lives is implicit in the principle of Balance, at the heart of the Co-active<span style="position:relative; top:-5px; font-size:9px;">&reg;</span> coaching model.</p>
									
									<p>This is the subject of this edition's Learning Point article by CPCC, and CTI leader, Nick Martin; as well as the passion of Beth Follini, our featured coach in our Co-active Profile; and the focus of the forthcoming European Co-active Community Day – see news – which explores the relationship between internal influences and external limitations.</p>
									<p>If you find yourself looking for a new perspective in your career or life this month, then why not consider attending one of our Fundamentals, introduction to Co-active Coaching courses scheduled this October and November, in London, or Manchester.</p>
									
									<p>Taken by over 20,000 people worldwide, the Fundamentals offers both those in search of a new career as a coach, and those looking to progress their career with a new skill set, a powerful experience that can catalyse new pathways for growth and transformation. </p>
									
									<p>For a full list of our forthcoming courses, click here, <a href="http://www.coaching-courses.com/coach-training/dates-and-locations/index.html">http://www.coaching-courses.com/coach-training/dates-and-locations/index.html</a> or for more information, please email our senior program advisor, Judy Rich <a href="mailto:judy@thecoaches.com">judy@thecoaches.com</a> or by phone +44 (0)845 299 8199.</p>
									<p>Wherever you are in your personal development or career as a coach, we hope to see you on one of our courses soon.</p>

									<p><strong>See Your Client’s Opportunities for Development Rise to the Surface Instantly</strong></p>
									
									<p>The <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/coach-training/assessments-and-tools/">Leadership Circle Profile (TLCP) Certification</a> is a three-day experience resulting from extensive collaboration between CTI and The Leadership Circle. This training program, which combines data and theory of a world class assessment tool with the Co-active Coaching model, is designed to prepare you to successfully use The Leadership Circle Profile, <em>The Leadership Culture Survey</em>, and the <em>Follow-Through Tool</em>.</p>  
									   
									<p>“I’m finding that during this economic downturn, companies are far more receptive to hiring me to administer a tool that includes coaching as opposed to just coaching,” says Leslie Clark. “They want something tangible &ndash; they really appreciate the unique qualities TLCP has to offer...it’s not just another 360. Using TLCP provides a broader view for the client that allows us to go deeper and do more impactful work.”</p>
									
									<p>This program is approved by ICF for CCEUs. Registration deadline for London course is October 4th. For information on The Leadership Circle or to register call 415-451-6000 in the U.S.</p>

									<p><strong>By Nick Martin, CPCC</strong></p>
									
									<p>Balance is different for different people. For the sumo wrestler, it is solid, grounded and immovable. For the ballerina, it is graceful, poised and elegant. For the white-water kayaker, it is flexible, flowing, and ever-changing. For the cyclist on the high wire, it is precarious, focused and dynamic.</p>
									
									<p>In fact, for all of them, balance involves movement, and so it is for us in our lives.</p>
									
									<p>Balance is never static; it is always going somewhere – to the end of the bout, to the end of the performance, to the other side of the wire, to the bottom of the river.</p>
									
									<p>Balance may not be static, but it does include stillness. One of the questions that sometimes comes up during CTI Balance courses is: “Why is this course called Balance?” At this stage, participants have noticed that it is not about ‘balancing’ our lives so that we have the ‘perfect’ balance between (say) work, family, and personal space. </p>
									
									<p>So if it is not that, what is it?</p>
									
									<p>There are a number of ways of answering that question, and in fact, they are all variations of the same thing.</p>
									
									<p>First, there is the balance between doing and being. There are two forms of laziness. There is the Eastern form, which consists of spending many hours of the day simply sitting in the sun (or the shade), reflecting and contemplating. Contrast this with the Western form of laziness, which consists of filling many hours of the day with frantic activity and busy-ness, and avoiding being with our own thoughts.</p>
									
									<p>This aspect of balance is not just about the difference between doing and not-doing. It is also about the ‘being’ that we bring to our ‘doing’. Who are we as we do whatever it is that we do? This is the root of the perspective work that forms such an important part of the CTI Balance course. As I do whatever I do, what beliefs do I have (e.g. about myself and others); what values am I honouring (or not); and what mood am I in? Because, to be sure, those beliefs, those values, and that mood, will all have an impact on what I do.</p>
									
									<p>This brings us to the second aspect of balance, which concerns the distinction between consciousness and unconsciousness. I am always in a perspective about something – but I may not be aware of that… and I may be even less aware that other perspectives might be possible. </p>
									
									<p>If I am stuck in one way of seeing a situation that I am in, then I am reducing my options for doing something about that situation. If I assume that this morning’s team meeting will be a crashing bore because they always are, then it probably will be. So, balance is also about waking up, and being more aware.</p>
									
									<p>A third aspect of balance is the distinction between living the life I want, and living the life that circumstances – and other people – impose on me. At CTI we say that Fulfilment is a radical act. The radical act is in stepping beyond the constraints of circumstances and expectations, and towards what is important for us. Balance is another way of looking at the same thing. The circumstances may not go away; the opinions of other people may not change – and we can choose whether to be constrained by them or not.</p>
									
									<p>Balance is different for different people. With this third aspect of balance in mind, if I am out of balance I might be pursuing a career that pays well and gives me some social status. Moving towards balance might involve leaving that career to pursue some other form of work that is more fulfilling and more in line with my values. If I am out of balance, I might bite my tongue and remain silent in the face of conflict. Moving towards balance would involve speaking out more.</p>
									
									<p>So, whether you are balancing between being and doing; bringing balance to an entrenched perspective on the way things ‘are’; or, choosing not to be constrained by circumstances or others opinions, balance is always dynamic.</p> 
									
									<p>Think back for a moment to the cyclist at the beginning of this article.</p> 
									
									<p>Even in those moments when they are stationary on the high wire there is still movement as they move subtly from side to side to maintain their balance. It is these adjustments, of awareness and of perspective, which they have to make before they move forward again.</p> 
									
									<p>It is the same in our lives.</p> 

<p>When things are stuck and not flowing, Balance coaching provides the key to creating forward motion once more. That motion, may take us to calmer waters of quiet reflection, the open waters of possibilities, or an exhilarating white-water ride.</p>

									<p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/emails/ctiuk/images/img_beth-follini.jpg" style="float:right;" /><strong>To begin with, would you tell us which part of the Co-active model had the biggest emotional impact on you, when you took CTI’s Fundamentals course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>What I do remember strongly is that I was so impressed by the holistic nature of the model – the sense of the inter-connectedness of ALL these bits of ourselves, between the BIG A agenda of who we are becoming, what our vision is, how we want to live our lives and all the day to day details of what we might otherwise think is our agenda.</p>  
									   
									<p><strong>How has that deepened over the years since taking the course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>It’s deepened very much! I have a strong conviction when I meet new clients that the most important thing I do as a coach is to facilitate clients to step into the ‘fullness of their lives’. I’ve learnt from clients that the biggest and most transformative aspect of our work is helping them to really experience their full powerful selves.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Today, what does it mean to you to ‘Be’ Co-active in your personal life...</strong></p> 
									
									<p>I see being co-active as being only one part of how I am and be in the world. Actually, the role co-activity played in my life is that it was a catalyst for me to get clearer about who I am, what I believe and how I want to live. This doesn’t necessarily mean (paradoxically) that I feel I am living a co-active life – I don’t identify myself as ‘being co-active’ in how I live. Co-activity was something that resonated with me from the start because of ways I live and things I believe in. I was brought up a Quaker and returned to Quakerism after starting the CTI leadership programme. Quakerism is very much about living the paradox of ‘being’ in the world (i.e. inward contemplation) and ‘doing’ (practical action to make the world a better place). The notion of co-creation is an important aspect to Quakerism - how do we engage with the world within us and outside us. The idea of co-creation is something which obviously Co-active coaching and leadership is based upon, but the concept of co-creation is an old as the hills, it is in so many different traditions and philosophies. I believe that what the originators of the Co-active Model have done was find a way of ‘re-ordering’ this ancient concept in a practical and applicable way for our modern lives/times.</p>
									
									<p><strong>and in your primary relationships?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I think the principles behind Co-active leadership have influenced my relationship with my partner. Do I see myself as ‘the star’ in my relationships with my life partners and friends or are we striving to both be in our centre and blend with the other?</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What do you think it is about the Co-active model that’s so attractive to the many women you have worked with as a ‘maybe baby’ coach?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Of course, many of my clients come to me about the decision to have a child or not – that’s my one of my niche areas. And you know what I ALWAYS say to them when they contact me? ‘You know, we will of course explore this decision, this is why you are here, AND we will look at the bigger picture, who you are becoming, how you can lean into your authentic selves, what it means to stretch into those emotions that you don’t really like to experience. When you do that, you will find that your decision will become clearer and less confused.’</p> 
									
									<p>The most overwhelming feedback I’ve had from clients was that they came expecting to be ‘fixed’, to have simply made a decision one way or the other, and they got a whole lot more than that. What I love about my clients is how brave and courageous they are – what a privilege it is to go on this amazing journey together with them!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>As well as working as a coach, you continue to work as a fundraising consultant to the voluntary sector. How has being ‘Co-active’ inspired that work?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I think Co-active leadership and coaching has given me a great deal of confidence in my leadership skills and impact. As a consultant with not-for-profits, I am much more direct and clear with my clients about what is working and what isn’t with their organisations and their approach to income generation. I find the aspect of using ‘fierce courage’ to tell a CEO of a charity the hard truth serves both me and the organisations very well.</p>
									
									<p><strong>How do you use the Co-active coaching model, to recover on the bad days?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I have several perspectives I tend to go to help me choose another way of looking at or being with a situation or problem. The idea of a Future Self is something I use a lot. I find being able to access that more centred, whole, powerful part of me so valuable, I can see that I’m more becoming my future self now. Just asking the question ‘So what would my future self do or say here?’ immediately enables me to shift and recover.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>Tell us what you do for fun?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I love going out to parks and playgrounds with my five year old son Sam – I enjoy watching him leap in and Co-create with others. It’s a joy how he’ll just go up to a group of children he has never met before and say ‘Can I play with you?’ and then watch how they create their play from anything and everything! I hang out with my life-partner Dave Cliff who is a jazz musician and who is also free in the day-times – when we are both at home in the day-time and Sam is at school, it’s great fun to go out to lunch together!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>Your wildest ambition, including the one you hesitate to share?</strong></p>
									
									<p>My wildest ambition is that in 10 years I am the leader of a network of international partners who are bringing the Polarity & Wholeness practice and ways of being that I’ve developed with Ursula Glunk, into the world! I'll be leading workshops, writing articles and advising leaders on how to ‘bring wholeness to a divided world.’ Central to this vision of mine, is that the book I’m currently writing with Ursula—Creating from Polarity: The Paradox of Leadership in a Divided World—will be a bestseller, and will be a ‘must have’ on reading lists all over the world!</p>
