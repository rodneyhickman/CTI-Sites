														<p>SAN RAFAEL, CA, August 31, 2011 – When <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> was first released in 1998, this pioneering work set the stage for what has become a cultural and business phenomenon and helped launch the profession of coaching. Required reading in many professional development and university-based executive coaching programs, and the go-to guide used by thousands to elevate their communication, relationship and coaching skills, <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> became a perennial best-seller of the training and development industry. </p>
														<p>Now the release of the newly revised third edition marks the 20th anniversary of both the coaching profession and the first coaching courses taught by the authors, the founders of <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com">The Coaches Training Institute (CTI)</a>, the oldest and largest in-person coach training school in the world.</p>

														<p>“With its third updated edition, <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> remains the bible of coaching guides,” says Stephen R. Covey, best-selling author of <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. “Written with a powerful, distinctive approach, no other book gives you the tools, the skills and the fundamentals needed to succeed in these delicate relationships.”</p>
													
														<p>The third edition features an array of new material:</p>

														<ul>
															<li>The expanded vision of the newly updated Co-Active Model</li>
															<li>How to use the material in leadership management and throughout organizations</li>
															<li>An on-line toolkit with updated coaching tools that replaces the CD of the last edition</li>
															<li>New coaching demonstrations</li>
															<li>35+ updated exercises, questionnaires, checklists and reproducible forms</li>
														</ul>

														<p>The Co-Active Model featured in <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> has always encompassed a philosophy, a methodology, a skill set and a communication form that balances self-awareness, relationship intelligence and courageous action so people can be deeply fulfilled, connected to others and successful in what matters most. The Co-Active Model is the foundation of all the courses taught by CTI, and it is being applied in business, education, medicine, government, communities and families around the world. </p>

														<p style="text-align: justify;">“But the old Co-Active Model was about incremental change; the new one is about transformational change,” says co-author Henry Kimsey-House, a co-founder of CTI. “We discovered coaches were following the client’s agenda too literally, for better or worse. We didn’t teach it that way, but that’s how it was sometimes interpreted. We’ve tightened the bolts down now. The coach’s job is now defined as evoking transformation. The coach doesn’t decide what the transformation is but holds it firmly as the goal. If no major shifts are happening, it’s wimpy coaching. Drive and deliver – the masculine was what was missing in the old model.”</p>
														
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key reason the Co-Active Model and the book were updated was “to reflect our expanded vision of seeking global transformational change,” says co-author Karen Kimsey-House, the CEO of CTI. “Our profession was born into celebration of the individual and a commitment for people to be individually unique and magnificent. The time has come to put our attention on the whole, the collective and the undeniable relationship that we have with every other speck of life in this wondrous universe. We belong to one another. Whether we like that or not is of little consequence: It’s sort of like standing out in the rain and having a disagreement with a hurricane.”</p>
														
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, with the guidance of Co-Active Coaching, many coaches, managers, executives, parents, leaders and educators have already begun to seek both personal and global transformational change, from becoming the president of an international university with the mission of shaping students into global citizens, to changing the culture of one of the largest community foundations in the U.S…from mentoring third-world girls through college in the U.S., to coaching Japan’s earthquake and tsunami survivors…from coaching diabetes patients to reduce their need for insulin, to growing a start-up consultancy of a major technology company 38% in a down market.</p>
														 
														<p style="text-align: justify;">“Transformation is confusing and scary,” says Karen Kimsey-House “Our Co-Active tools and skills can be enormously helpful in facing these challenges.  There are many organizations working to create a global shift and our work is an important piece of the solution. We want to inspire people to identify their piece and give it all they’ve got. If you’re interested in transformation, we’re interested in your piece, too.”</p>
