<p>
	<br />
	Hello [firstname,fallback=],</p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m excited to share with you that CTI has set a mission of creating transformative change in the world through Co-Active work in its many forms. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/resources/multimedia/We-Have-a-Job-to-Do.html">We have a job to do</a>. I believe there has never been a more important time than now for the Co-Active community to be in strong relationship, connection and collaboration to support each other in courageous action to achieve our goals. This letter is full of information and events; please read to the end.</p>
<p>

	There is so much changing in our work, both here at CTI and in the world at large. The Co-Active Model has always balanced self-awareness, relationship intelligence and courageous action so people can be deeply fulfilled, connected to others and successful in what matters most. We want to ensure that you are empowered to move forward together with us because you ARE the Co-Active Way made real day by day and conversation by conversation.</p>
<p>
	We have come to realize that Co-Active concepts apply to more than coaching; they are relevant to all aspects of life. Inspired by our vision, we&rsquo;ve been working hard here at CTI to facilitate our ever-expanding mission with new thinking and program designs. I&rsquo;m EXCITED to be the one to announce these changes to you. You are an important part of the change CTI wants to be in the world and I want you to feel as if I am right there beside you, talking directly to you.</p>
<p>
	Recently, we completed some important revisions to the Co-Active Model and the Co-Active Coaching Core Curriculum. Several Co-Active Model cornerstones have been updated as has the Core Curriculum, which has an improved flow from course to course, and introduces some new concepts like the Captain and Crew, Life Purpose at a greater depth, and more understanding of what Co-Active means and how it defines Co-Active Coaching. While all five courses have been improved, the greatest change was made to the fifth course, &#39;In the Bones,&#39; which will now be called &#39;Synergy.&#39;</p>

<p>
	Our community encompasses a diverse population with different learning styles and different needs so we&rsquo;ve create a variety of different ways for you to plug in and get current. CTI has created five ways to interact with the new material to give you ample opportunity and options to really absorb the concepts. Each option is detailed below. If you are like me, you&rsquo;ll want to pursue a combination of sources and methods to effectively add this content to your knowledge base.</p>
<h3>
	1. Bridging Content</h3>
<p>
	We have created Bridging Content online for you to review immediately that will point out where the differences are between the updated course and your previous classroom experience. Changes are highlighted course-by-course with descriptions and explanations of any new content. This resource includes the updated Co-Active Model with a full explanation of what it means and how to use it, as well as improved coaching tools and skills. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/learning-hub/bridging-content/syn/syn-intro.html">Click here to begin</a>.</p>
<p>

	Enter <strong>coactive</strong> in both the Email address and Password fields of the sign-in box. You will then be given the opportunity to create a unique login for yourself so you may review the material again and again.</p>

	<br />
	2. Webinar: Meet the New Co-Active Model with Karen and Henry</h3>

	3.<em> Co-Active Coaching</em>, Third Edition Book</h3>

<p>
	The third edition of <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> features an array of new material including an in-depth look at the newly updated Co-Active Model in Chapter 1. Other concepts that have been incorporated into the redesigned curriculum are sprinkled throughout the book. The CD toolkit of the last edition has been replaced by an online toolkit that will be updated as appropriate. <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> is available in print and electronic versions from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Co-Active-Coaching-Changing-Business-Transforming/dp/1857885678/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316117154&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon US</a>, Amazon&rsquo;s international sites, as well as other booksellers.</p>

	4. 50% Off Courses</h3>
<p>
	Individuals who have completed the five course Core Curriculum prior to the redesign may repeat any or all courses at 50% off a la carte pricing. This offer includes the significantly redesigned course &lsquo;Synergy.&rsquo; There will, however, be a limit of five repeating participants in any specific class so that the quality of experience, discovery and learning may be maintained for all. Contact your local Co-Active training provider for course dates and availability.</p>

	<br />
	5. Meet the New Co-Active Model Workshop</h3>

<p>
	Karen and Henry Kimsey-House will be touring all of the locations where we run courses in North America conducting day-long workshops from Fall 2011 to Spring 2012. Look for additional international dates in 2012. These events are designed with the same high caliber and attention to detail as any of our courses and give our alumni a way to hear from our founders about the curriculum changes and updated Co-Active Model.</p>
<p>
	During the Workshop Karen and Henry will be working extensively with the updated cornerstones to get you really grounded in our shared stake. Workshop participants will work with Captain and Crew and other new tools for transformative coaching as well as Co-Active Strategy from Balance. The being/doing of Co-Active will be discussed and sessions will touch on the concept of Synergy and give some context for the change.</p>
<p>
	Each one-day workshop will begin at 9:00 am local time and end at 5:00 pm local time and cost $175 USD per person. If you wish to attend any workshop scheduled in 2011, register by October 21, 2011 and the cost will be just $125 USD. If you wish to attend any 2012 workshop, register by December 9, 2011 and the cost will be $125 USD. Click the city name to register for any workshop listed below.</p>

	The changes discussed in this email are a natural evolution of the Model and the work itself in response to what&rsquo;s needed today. It heralds a new era for Co-Activity where we stand together and declare our shared intention to create a global shift in the way people relate to each other.</p>
<p>
	I hope you love the evolution of the Co-Active Model and Core Curriculum as much as I do and I look forward to seeing you in person soon. Thank you for your wisdom, your partnership and for the important part you play in spreading Co-Active work in the world.</p>
<p>
	Love,&#8232;<br />
