			<p>My name is Carrie Kish and I am the new CTI Ambassador in the Los Angeles area. If you are receiving this email, it is because you, too, are one of CTI’s Ambassadors and I want to enlist you in spreading the Co-active<span style="font-size:9px; position:relative; top:-3px;">&reg;</span> Way wherever we can.</p>
			
			<p>The Co-active Way is CTI’s position that Co-activity is about more than coaching. It is about training leaders to be Co-active and to participate in co-creating our world, a world that works for everybody. Co-activity is about how we are in relationship with one another, how we interact with our families, how we do our work, how we fulfill our missions and so much more. It is about how much our work matters and how much our mission matters.</p>
			
			<p>As your representative in the Los Angeles area, I have three commitments:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>To connect with and add value to the CTI student and graduate community through social and educational live and virtual events.</li>
				<li>To represent CTI at the International Coach Federation in Los Angeles (ICFLA) and create on-going opportunities for collaboration.</li>
				<li>To be a Co-active example in my work and my life by sharing the Co-active Way with as many people as possible.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>I invite you to join me in these commitments and to help me bring more Co-activity to Southern California. I look forward to connecting with you and getting to know you. Please feel free to email me with any questions and recommendations. Please feel free to refer your friends and colleagues with questions to me, as well.</p>
