														<h3>New Curriculum Updates<br /><br /></h3>
														<p>We launched! It&rsquo;s a great feeling as it has been a big project for all involved. There have been quite a few separate emails on this and more will come, so stay tuned. Here are some important highlights/info:</p>
														<p>The new Fundamentals course has launched well. Ronnie and Milne did the first one 9/2 in Oslo (yes we launched something outside North America!), then we did six in North America the weekend of 9/9. Comments back from leaders have been very positive about working with the new model and timelines. Check out the facebook conversation at the CTI water cooler.</p>
														<p>The Learning Hubs are complete! If you haven&rsquo;t already linked to them through your bridging content, check them out. This is what your participants will be going through prior to, during and after their courses. They contain all the new curriculum content as well as the old manual content and they replace the manual participants used to receive. Please refer participants to these Learning Hubs for all their course material. There are two of them. One is for Fundamentals participants and one is for the intermediate course participants. Use the same email/password you used for the bridging content:</p>
														<ul>
															<li>Fundamentals Learning Hub link &ndash; <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/learning-hub/fundamentals">http://www.thecoaches.com/learning-hub/fundamentals</a></li>
															<li>Intermediate Learning Hub link &ndash; <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/learning-hub/intermediate">http://www.thecoaches.com/learning-hub/intermediate</a></li>
														</ul>
															
														<p>So far 44 leaders have completed the bridging content (THANK YOU!) and there are still 107 leaders notified and outstanding. Front of Room Leaders - You have the list of required training items, so do complete those to stay on the leader schedule. We&rsquo;re going to wait until Q1 before doing the next overall context call with all leaders on the new material, as we want leaders to get some experience with the content first to make it a juicy call.</p>
														<p>If you missed my email on the topic of how our alumni can get up to speed on the new curriculum, check it out. One way is that Karen and Henry will be doing one-day workshops around North America and perhaps in some international locations next year! Tied to this, they will be making themselves available to meet with leaders in each of the locations where they will be presenting, so keep your eye out for an invitation.</p>
														<p>As a reminder: Any of you who can and want to be in the back of the room to learn the material, we want you there. Just register like you would for a journey so we know there&rsquo;s room for you and everyone knows you&rsquo;ll be there (CTI or partner and leaders). You are responsible for your own learning and for being respectful of the course. For those of you leading a course with leaders in the back, there isn&rsquo;t a job for you to do with them, just do the great job you always do with your participants and assistants.</p>

														<h3>Certification News<br /><br /></h3>
														<p>As of Oct. 1st the exam will be part of the price of Certification. This will add $500 to the price of the program which is a wash overall as there will be no cost for the exam.</p>
														<p>The program and training redesign are underway. Hope is our lead designer, with Sandra and Jim as design team members. We&rsquo;ll be rolling out two pilot pods in January and launching the updated program in February. Certification faculty &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be getting updates from your track holders in the next month or so about how it&rsquo;s going. In late fall we&rsquo;ll start scheduling the needed training.</p>

														<h3>Leadership Scholarship News<br /><br /></h3>
														<p>As of October 1st, you can offer a $1,000/1,000E discount to anyone you claim for the leadership program. This is double the previous amount!</p>
														<p>For the CTI scholarship, we&rsquo;re moving forward. We&rsquo;re tracking on leadership program applications who the key people were who moved the applicant to register in the leadership program. We&rsquo;ll soon be reporting out on the leader names we&rsquo;ll be capturing from those applications and the amount CTI is investing in the scholarship fund as a result. (In case you missed it, refer back to the last edition of the Leader Spark for more details about the program.)</p>

														<h3>Advisory Team Update<br /><br /></h3>
														<p>The Advisory Team continues to meet with Karl and Sabrina on a monthly basis. The conversations have been rich. At the beginning, the team said they didn&rsquo;t want it to be just conversation; they wanted to help make some changes and some new initiatives real. And that has happened. Some of the things that have been made real with Advisory Team input so far this year include: a new agreement for leaders who bring corporate work to CTI, a CTI scholarship for the leadership program, an increase in the amount of money a leader can offer a participant when they claim them for leadership.</p>
															<p>One of the ongoing topics in the Advisory Team calls has been leader engagement and accountability. By January, we&rsquo;ll have communication and next steps for everyone on this topic.</p>
