									<p>Either way, we’re anywhere other than the present except to get busy to prepare for an event that’s yet to come. It’s part of the human condition and completely understandable, when the present may seem to offer little to make us happy.</p>
									
									<p>Like other coaching models, Co-active<span style="position:relative; top:-5px; font-size:9px;">&reg;</span> Coaching also looks to the future and the potential to live a more fulfilled life, and yet where Co-active coaches often stand out is in their ability to coach the client exactly where they are right now. Whatever that looks or feels likes. Indeed, what the client is feeling in the present moment, including within the coaching session itself &ndash; happiness, frustration, joy, or sadness &ndash; is recognised as a resource to work with in service of discovering more about what they want or who they are.</p>
									
									<p>This is a theme explored throughout this newsletter. From Tony Barton, one of CTI’s Leaders, an excellent article about Process coaching, to our interview with Corrina Gordon-Barnes, our featured Co-active Profile, whose business <em>You Inspire Me</em> has served hundreds of women in escaping the treadmill and honouring their dreams right now.</p>
									
									<p>There’s also news of the forthcoming Co-active Summit in Florida, where the Co-active community will come together to explore the role of Co-active Coaching and Leadership in creating deep transformation in the world. If you can’t wait to scroll down to read more, then simply <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RcY0IgNsr0" style="color: #689bbc !important;">click here to watch CTI co-founder Henry Kimsey-House</a> speak about the Summit, right now.</p>
									
									<p>Elsewhere you’ll find news of forthcoming UK courses in 2011 including information about our Christmas Holiday Promotion. Taken by over 20,000 people worldwide, the Fundamentals offers both those in search of a new career as a coach, and those looking to progress their career with a new skill set, a powerful experience that can catalyse new pathways for growth and transformation. </p>
									
									<p>Wherever you are in your personal development or career as a coach, we hope that you are enjoying the moment, and the many rich opportunities it offers for growth and transformation. </p>

												<p>I always refer to the principle of Process as the jewel in the crown of Co-Active coaching. Process is ALL about life and aliveness, not yesterday; not tomorrow but right NOW – in this very moment you are reading these words.</p>
									
												<p>There is no other time than now.</p>
									
												<p>Carpe Diem &ndash; or maybe that should be ‘Carpe Momentum’ &ndash; seizing those moments and luxuriating in whatever the moment brings is what Process is all about. If we don’t, we are missing out on our lives, simple as that.</p>

									<p>Wish Fulfilment and Balance coaching (the other 2 principles of Co-active Coaching) quite rightly have their eye on the future. Process wants nothing more than to hang out in what’s going on now. I’d wager you’d be surprised at just how much is going on in any given moment. (These moments by the way are given only once; something that becomes increasingly apparent the older you get!) </p>
									
									<p>So, instead of talking about the moment as an abstract state, let’s try it.</p>
									
									<p>Yes, right now.</p>
									
									<p>Stop what you are doing for a moment, and take a couple of deep breaths.</p>
									
									<p>Then take a stock check, an inventory of what’s going on in your life right now…move out of your head and scan your body, pretend you’re a special ERI scanner that can detect emotions…what can you feel…where are those emotions hiding…check the usual places if there’s not much showing up…you know, the heart, the stomach, behind your eyes…found them yet? They are there, you just have to allow them to be present…and be open to feeling them when they show up?</p>
									
									<p>Once a client is in touch with what they are feeling in the moment, in Process coach training we would make a learning distinction between what we call ‘up the tube’ emotions and ‘down the tube’ emotions. Emotion has the word motion in it, and once we notice emotion, we also notice that it wants to, or has the potential to move, to expand, or transform in some way. It’s not always as literal as up and down, but the coaches’ sensitivity to this movement can help orient the client in expanding their experience of what they are feeling.</p>
									
									<p>And we want to expand the experience of the moment, and what we are feeling, not because we want to sweep our feelings away, but because they are a rich source of learning. They are in fact our life force, the unique experiences of what it is to be a human being, and when we take time to stop and notice, to feel and acknowledge what is going on in our lives, we can learn to appreciate that fact in ourselves and others, and always in service of learning more about who we are and what we truly want.</p>
									
									<p>Have you done the exercise yet? How are you doing with your new ERI scanner? What have you found?</p>
									
									<p>Maybe some sadness is trying hard not to be noticed, or perhaps you have detected some frustration that was lurking behind that stiff upper lip? Oh and there’s some tiredness…let’s take a closer look at that shall we? Are you ready to explore?</p>
									
									<p>OK so let’s name that tiredness so it knows that we’re onto it and then get a sense of where it is in your body right now. It’s always good to locate it, that way we can bring it out into the open and take a good close look at it. OK, so you’ve found where your tiredness seems to be most present. Now take a stab at creating a metaphor for how that tiredness feels. What is it like?</p> 
									
									<p>Is it like a flat balloon; a wet duvet; a big dark cloud…what’s your tiredness like?</p> 
									
									<p>Because metaphor is a brilliant vehicle for exploring and expanding on our feelings and emotions, because sometimes it can be difficult to describe feelings beyond...well, you know...tired...that’s how it feels…why are you asking me such a dumb question?!</p> 
									
									<p>OK, so now you’ve got a metaphor for your tiredness (or whatever emotion or feeling you identified) – really explore and expand it – make it as real as you can by getting really curious about it…the colour, the weight, the feel, the texture, the scent. Use all your senses to really be in the experience of your tiredness.</p> 

									<p>You’ll be surprised at what you find and stay with it for as long as you can, going deeper and deeper into it (I often imagine that I’m so small that I can actually squeeze into a single cell in my body where the feeling is showing up to get a really close up experience of what it’s like to be there whether it’s a tired cell, or a happy cell or a sad one, whatever the emotion is that’s present there in the moment.</p>
 
									<p>And more often than not (always!) you’ll find movement with emotions morphing and changing from one moment to the next &ndash; another emotion &ndash; a different one &ndash; because nothing ever stays the same, that’s why it is so important to keep checking in with your client as to where they are ‘right now’ when you are Process coaching with them, because wherever they are now…they are going to be somewhere else before long so you need to stay curious so that you can take them into the experience that is present now, not the one that was there a few moments ago.</p>
									
									<p>As coach you just stay with your client, wherever they are…and then when you hear something that has an emotional quality (your client feels tired, happy, bored, frustrated, delighted, annoyed) that’s your cue to take them deeper into that emotion…like a rock climber lowering a colleague down a cliff face by slowly releasing more rope for them to go down at their own pace…your job is to make sure they feel secure and safe as they go down and to build the trust for them to get to the bottom.</p>
									
									<p>So, wherever you are on your path as a coach &ndash; just starting out, or more experienced, keep pressing the pause  &ndash; button to take time to use your ERI scanner and be curious with your own Process and discovering the emotional jewels that are there in any given moment. And in doing so, we can learn to be ever more curious about the jewels that are always present in our clients, if only they knew how to find them…and it’s our privilege as coaches to show them the way. How cool is that?</p>

												<p><strong>When you took CTI’s Fundamentals course, which part of the Co-active model had the biggest emotional impact on you?</strong></p>
												
												<p>The context of addressing the client’s whole life. I was the demo client for the Wheel of Life activity and focused on the area of ‘Home’ which at the time felt empty, cold and very dissatisfying. I quickly saw that ‘Home’ wasn’t just about ‘Home’ but also about my friends, my relationship with my partner, money... all these interweaving strands. I was struck by the depth of the work and by the honesty which the leader called forth in me. And how no area was off-limits; I felt fully seen, as a whole and interesting person. I remember feeling such an expansion of possibilities and a physical buzz and warmth as I envisioned what I really wanted—and which I now, indeed, have.</p>

									<p><strong>How has that deepened over the years since taking the course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I work with women who want to turn their passion into a profitable business so it might look like that’s a clear case of ‘career’ coaching. But you can only go so far in that direction and then blocks come up which relate to other slices of life. So if a client feels unsupported by her partner or if she can’t have children, that’s having an impact. If she has neglected her artistic practice or her meditation time, that has an impact. All these strands have an impact and once they’re addressed, that frees her up to break through blockages and move forward with her primary focus.</p>
									
									<p>Likewise for me in my own life, if it feels I’m banging away at a challenge and nothing’s shifting, it’s invariably time for me to focus on making a change in another area. It can sometimes be counter-productive to look something right in the eye which is why the ‘Whole Life’ context is so important. It offers the perspective that we’re multi-stranded beings—tug at one strand, you shift the others.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Today, what does it mean to you to ‘Be’ Co-active, both in your personal life and primary relationships, in the local community and as a global citizen?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>It means taking a stand—for the three principles of the Co-active model—that we are allowed to be fulfilled (Fulfillment), at choice (Balance) and present (Process) to our lives. </p>
																		
									<p>It also means that I listen without trying to fix. I have previously felt angry and stressed about environmental issues and now I feel a lot calmer and more trusting. Society itself is naturally creative, resourceful, and whole and if we put loving attention and positive regard on what’s happening, we notice that change IS possible. Being co-active is also about knowing what we personally can take responsibility for &ndash; and owning that &ndash; and also knowing what is out of our control. It (being co-active) is like the power of the Serenity prayer (grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; Courage to change the things I can; And wisdom to know the difference), which can be applied at the personal, community and global level.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What part of the Co-active model or way, do you notice has the greatest impact on the women entrepreneurs you work with in your business You Inspire Me?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Accountability. Self-employment is by its very nature a solitary endeavour and without someone there to check in with and without knowing someone cares, women entrepreneurs can put a lot of time and energy in and find their efforts going in the wrong direction or their passion loses momentum and certain products and services don’t make it out into the marketplace. There’s the accountability of our sessions themselves &ndash; knowing you turn up at a certain time, regularly, and then I also hold them to dates they set for themselves: when they want their website to launch, when they book a workshop date, etc.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>You are one of a vanguard of coaches today who has successfully mastered social media to grow your business, but is it ever possible to be co-active and authentic online, compared with the power of face-to-face contact?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Yes! There can be this assumed communication hierarchy: in person better than phone, phone better than online. I don’t buy into that, it’s all connection. In fact, sometimes we allow ourselves to be MORE authentic in the more ‘virtual’ settings because they feel safer. Face-to-face can be distracting: we can try to please, to modify our facial expressions. I actually find when I’m communicating online (and also with text), it can feel almost psychic. You’re having direct mind-to-mind or soul-to-soul contact. We say the things we might not say in person, or through the filter of our mouths when we’re trying to fit in socially.</p>
									
									<p><strong>You are known for your active involvement in creating a more sustainable world. What role do you feel models like the co-active one, have to play in creating deep transformative change, through movements such as Transition Town.</strong></p>
									
									<p>It’s about possibility. Imagining possibilities, not just accepting the options we get handed down from governments or society or our culture. We get to look at how things are working, very squarely in the face, and ask: IS this working? Is it working the best way it can? We’re allowed to ask the questions, we’re given permission to challenge the status quo and then create from a blank page what we really want for ourselves.</p>
									<p>The co-active model also gives us a tool for supporting people through deep grief and in these transition times, there may well be a lot of that: shock, bewilderment, a sense of loss. We can be with people at that deep level and give them a chance to process their emotions and be empowered, rather than paralyzed, by them. Both coactivity and the Transition model are about the empowerment of the individual and harnessing collective resourcefulness.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>How do you use the Co-active coaching model to recover on the bad days?</strong></p>
									
									<p>The metaview is a very handy tool here. Whatever is happening today, it allows me to rise above the situation and see the bigger picture, and also stand in the mystery of it. Yes, right now it feels like this is ‘bad’ but actually who knows how I’ll interpret it in a year’s time.</p>
									<p>Also, the Process approach of being with what is. If I’m feeling depleted or menstrual or grumpy or whatever, it’s okay to take myself to bed and wallow in that. I don’t have to try and change things and put on a happy face if I really just need to rest and be alone.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What’s the biggest surprise that you’ve found as a result of training in and working with the Co-active coaching model?</strong></p>
									
									<p>That we’re all different. I assumed I’d find our common humanity, but it’s been the opposite. People see things SO differently from me. That’s why I can genuinely get curious. What’s it like to be a Muslim woman who has six children and lives with her mother-in-law? I don’t listen in a way which tries to compare and map her reality against my own; instead I’m fascinated by her difference and how she makes it work: What’s the model she uses for her life? How does it all make sense for her? How does she build her business in a way which is completely distinct from how I build mine? My job is then to reveal to her what’s unique about her outlook so she can claim it as hers.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Tell us what you do for fun?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I took up running a few months ago. I ran my first 5K in September which was big for me, having dreaded the 1500m race so much at school that I deliberately injured myself so I could avoid having to run it on sports day! I went to Amsterdam to watch my brother and sister run the marathon which was very inspirational. I can’t say I see myself doing that but certainly a 10K or maybe even half-marathon aren’t impossibilities now. I find it a great stress relief on a busy day to go off with my iPod blaring some good Rihanna or Lady Gaga in my ears.</p>
									
									<p>I love movement generally, with one of my long-term favourites being Five Rhythms dancing which I’ve been doing for the past decade. I certainly don’t need much of an excuse to dance; when I have a big win in business, on goes Cascada ‘Evacuate The Dancefloor’ and I rock out on my landing.</p>
									<p>I’m a very proud auntie and playing with my 3 year old nephew and 1 year old niece fills me with total joy and is a wonderful distraction from anything too serious or complicated; I’m reconnected with the simple pleasures of being alive and full of wonder.</p>
									
									<p>And I like to eat a lot! I home-cook, cook for friends, and eat out in vegan-friendly restaurants as often as possible.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Your wildest ambitions, including the one you hesitate to share?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I always seem to be writing a book and this most recent one feels like it really has legs. In my wildest dreams, I imagine that being published, being a huge success, going on a book tour, doing signings and as part of that appearing as a guest on The Ellen Show. She’s very cool indeed and I’d be most happy to sit opposite her. You said wildest, right? ;)</p>
									
									<p>I’d also love to co-own some kind of centre with my partner where people get really nourished and loved. Our home has been called a sanctuary by several people and it would be wonderful to make that environment more widely available.</p>
