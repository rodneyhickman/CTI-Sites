												<p><strong>Welcome to the Summer 2011 edition of the CTI UK email newsletter.</strong></p>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you’ve ever met a graduate of CTI’s Coach Training programs, you may have heard them talk about something called ‘Co-Activity’, or at the very least the idea of being Co-Active<sup style="font-size: 10px;">&reg;</sup>. 
We don’t doubt that you were touched in some way by their enthusiasm, and yet we’d understand if you were left grasping for a more concrete definition. So while the Co-Active way really lives in the experience of connecting with someone trained in the model, in this newsletter we’ll do our best to help you get a better sense of what it means.</p>

									<p>The Co-Active model is rooted in a dynamic balance between feminine and masculine energies: where the feminine is represented by the word ‘Co’ of relationship, connection, intimacy, listening and love, and the masculine is represented by the word ‘Active’ of strength, achievement, personal power, intention and commitment.  And the hyphen between the words is there to signify that these two energies are inter-dependent.</p>
									
									<p>This is something that Sue Belton points to in her article about the UK local Co-Active Coaching Support Groups – the active challenge of growing our practice as a coach is infinitely easier when we are lovingly supported in that journey by like minds.</p>
									
									<p>CTI Leadership Program Leader Art Shirk builds on this in his wonderful article about the alchemy of Collective leadership, as illustrated by the quest of one of the tribes from CTI’s Leadership Program to co-design a transformative program for disadvantaged Polish teenagers, in just one hour!</p>
									
									<p>Then, finally we feature coach and leadership trainer Ronnie Clifford in our Co-Active profile – whose passion for co-activity effortlessly reveals that the depth we are able to authentically connect with others, is equal to the depth we are able to connect with our own true purpose and calling.</p>
									
									<p>Elsewhere, there’s a reminder of our Summer Promotions on our Fast Track and Fundamentals coach training programs. These offers are only valid for two more weeks, so be sure to act on them soon, or pass the information on to a colleague, client or friend who might be curious about Co-Activity.</p>
									
									<p>Wherever you are in your personal development or career as a coach, we hope to see you soon on one of our courses.</p>

												<p>They came together from all parts of Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Scandinavia for their first reunion-gathering since they completed the Co-Active Leadership Program in March, 2010. A bit tired from travelling but excited to see each other again and eager to dive into their "Retreat 5" that a small design team had created, members of the "Earth Dragon" Co-Active Leadership Tribe assembled together to begin their reunion.</p>
											
												<p>The design team, led by Jacek, welcomed the group to the start of their Retreat, held at a beautiful mountain-top retreat center in Poland.</p>
												
												<p>"Welcome Earth Dragons! In this Retreat we are not starting slowly...we are not waiting...we are calling ourselves forth as Leaders NOW! A group of 15 kids &ndash; teenagers with tough circumstances &ndash; is already coming up the mountain and they will be here in 1 hour. I have promised them an experience that will change their life. We must design it and be ready to go in one hour.  Oh...and none of them speak any English."</p>
												
												<p>After gasps of surprise and a few exclamations of "How can we do it?  It´s not enough time!"  members of the Earth Dragon tribe stepped into what we call "Level 4 Leadership" &ndash; they were called forth, they had a compelling purpose or "stake" as we call it, and were committed to giving themselves "full permission" to create magic. </p>
												<p>And create magic is exactly what they did. The kids arrived and experienced a day that they later described as "magic day", connecting with each other, discovering their own magnificence, and leaving with an energy that had been missing when they arrived. Of course, members of the Earth Dragons say that they were the ones transformed by the kids...that without understanding any words, they were able to "create from everything" because the possibility and magic was already there.</p>

									<p>I had the great honour of co-leading the Earth Dragon's Co-Active Leadership Program with my wonderful colleague Dr. Okokon Udo in 2009-2010. When their email arrived describing what they had accomplished in their Reunion Gathering in Poland I could not hold back the tears of joy and pride and "hurrayyyy!" that it inspired in me.  I am just so very proud of them and honoured to have played a part in their transformation.</p>
									
									<p>And, in various forms, this is what I have witnessed that happens in different forms from Co-Active Leadership tribes I have led over the years.  The stories of individual and collective leadership are astounding and extraordinary. For me, there is a special alchemy that happens most powerfully in our Programs in Europe, where people come together from so many different countries around the world.  In our "Masia" outside of Sitges Spain, emerging Co-Active Leaders, all of whom are committed to challenging and supporting each other in discovering the depth of who they are as Leaders - bring forth the tremendous uniqueness of each individual, culture and language - as well as the depth of our common humanity that exists across all cultures. It is truly a transformative alchemy.
									
									<p>Okokon and I eagerly await the arrival of a new tribe of eager aspiring leaders that will arrive at the Masia next November (2011). Who will be in that community?  Where will they come from? What dreams will unfold for them as individuals and as a new and powerful community of Leaders? We can hardly wait!</p>

									<p>By Sue Belton</p>
									
									<p>What if I were to tell you about something that was free, gave you an enormous amount of pleasure, and took relatively little or no effort to obtain?  Want some?  Well that’s exactly what participants say it’s like being part of a UK Local Co-Active Coaching Group.</p>
									
									<p>What’s <em>really great</em> about being part of a group is the companionship &ndash; coaching can be a lonely profession and I know that if I hadn’t had my own group of now friends going through the same experiences, I’m not sure that I would have stuck with it until now, and I certainly wouldn’t have enjoyed it so much!</p>
									
									<p>On top of the companionship you also get the sharing, learning and general boosting of one’s morale.  And in this age of internet and social networking, nothing does beat meeting up face to face, on a regular basis, with a bunch of people who understand exactly what you’re going through.  So when I heard about the opportunity to take the UK Local Groups Initiative to the next level I jumped at the chance.  Since becoming the Leader of the Initiative just over a year ago, I’ve helped numerous coaches get in touch with and join groups in their areas, and also helped four new groups get going.</p>
									
									<p>My aim is for every new coach coming through Core Curriculum to have a Local Group to join, and if you don’t, I want to call you forth in creating your own.</p>
									
									<p>I know that for many, being a member of one of these groups has really meant the difference between make or break as a coach, and at all times I’m reminded of the immortal coaching question: “How can this be easy?”</p>
									
									<p>And that sums it up for me – this coaching journey really can be easy, fun, light, and you can either sail alone, or with your own little fleet – which do you choose?</p>

												<p><strong>To begin with, would you tell us which part of the Co-Active experience had the biggest emotional impact on you when you took CTI’s Fundamentals course?</strong></p>
												
												<p>The thing that stood out for me in Fundamentals was how open and honest the leaders were.  I was stunned by the Authenticity I witnessed and by the resonance I felt with their life experiences. The other thing I loved was that there were two leaders, and the way they ‘danced’ together, had lots of fun and created amazing and life-changing learning for the group.  It is safe to say I was ‘hooked’ from that moment on.</p>

									</table>
									 
									<p><strong>How has that deepened over the years since taking the course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>My passion and niche is authentic leadership that is how people become authentic leaders in their own lives, this passion has continued and continues to evolve ever since the experience I had on Fundamentals.  How this has deepened for me over the years is that I have focused myself on being the most authentic I can be. I use the model to dig deep, to take the risk of living a fulfilled life, to ask for what I want and be willing to stick around to see if I have to negotiate. I am conscious that the perspective I have on my world dictates the experience I will have, and finally, and most importantly, I live my life moment to moment, really being in the experience of my life.  Yes I plan and yes I set intentions about the future and the things I want in my life, plus at the same time I am conscious and aware that living life moment to moment, breath to breath whilst connecting with the people and experience I am with, truly enables me to live in now.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Today, what does it mean to you to &lsquo;Be&rsquo; Co-Active, in your personal life...</strong></p> 
									
									<p>Being Co-Active means I get to do all of the above and I get to be me.  I get to be all of me with no excuses and apologies.  Life is simple and easy, even when I’m busy – which is quite often.</p>
																		
									<p><strong>in your work life?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>Being Co-Active in my work life has enabled me to really stretch into more of who I am.  Switching from a Sales Executive role to a Leadership coach and trainer role in IBM has been an amazing experience.  Every step of the way I get to stretch into the Co-Active model and stretch into more of myself. My values around learning and personal development are honoured every day and my ability to help others honour their values whilst delivering results to the company really proves that this model works!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>In addition to your work as a sales transformation coach for IBM, you are an independent Leadership coach, and CTI Front of Room Leader.  How does co-activity fit in the corporate world, and in particular with the emphasis on the client being true to themselves, help people working in such a results driven field?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>The world is complex, no one has any more time to do more.  Where Co-Active coaching and leadership really complements the corporate world is that we can coach and train people to be more of who they are authentically and therefore have more impact with less effort.  We all know that people who are more positive are more productive and that it doesn’t matter which area of their life they are more positive in, the productivity that it creates will unfold in all areas of their lives – including work.</p>
									
									<p><strong>What advice do you have to offer other Co-Active Coaches with a desire to work as coaches in larger Fortune 500 companies?</strong></p>
									
									<p>My advice would be, believe in yourself and believe in the Co-Active model.  Use it in your own life, and be one step, one book, or one page ahead of your clients and the companies you work for.  Never ask a client to do anything you have not experienced yourself.  Know you can make a difference and be willing to take risks to create the life and work you want to experience. Oh, and scare yourself every day (well maybe at least once or twice a week!)</p>
									
									<p>What I mean by scaring yourself is being willing to step into the unknown, to get outside your comfort zone. It’s called a comfort zone because it's comfortable &ndash; you know how to do that stuff. Be willing to get uncomfortable and be willing to believe you can achieve your vision.  My vision is to become the speaker of choice in the industry on how I helped change corporate culture using Co-Active and other leadership methodologies.  I am not going to achieve that by settling for what I have achieved and being content with my lot!  In my experience this is the key to human evolution and transformation.</p>
									
									<p>Finally, for those of you who are CTI trained, remember the enrollment line in the Fulfilment course. Remember how enrolling you are when you are passionate about something. It’s the passion that convinces people that you know what you are talking about and that you are worth listening to. It’s the passion that makes you and your work compelling.  So that's the final tip &ndash; get passionate and be enrolling and watch the impact it has on the people and companies you work with!</p>
									
									<p><strong>When you decided to retrain as a coach and leave your corporate sales executive role, what was the tipping point for you? When and how did you know it was time to change careers?</strong></p>
									
									<p>The tipping point was just the internal knowing that I had more to offer and that by not stepping into my new career, I was selling out on myself.</p>
									<p>The biggest stretch for me was to give up my executive status (people in the corporate world leave, retire or die before they will take a demotion) I had worked so hard to get, and yet the biggest surprise to me was the freedom I felt when I gave up my executive level.</p>
									
									<p>The light bulb moment for me was that actually I was not that person any more and I had grown out of that label and position.  It was a real stretch and far more painful to think about than it was to actually execute!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>How do you use the Co-Active coaching model to recover on the bad days?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I use it to check-in with myself – what value is being stepped on, what perspective am I in, what can’t I be with? Am I trying to avoid being where I am? Which saboteur is present?</p>
									
									<p>I get curious about what is going on for me and then just take it from there.  Worst case I get back into experiencing the present. </p>
									
									<p><strong>What’s your biggest mistake as a coach, and what did you learn from it?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Taking on a client that I actually didn’t want to coach, and I learned that the sample session is for both coach and client to decide if they are suited to each other. It is not just the client's decision.  Great learning!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What’s the biggest surprise that you’ve found as a result of training in and working with the Co-Active coaching model?</strong></p>
									
									<p>That life can be fun, simple, easy, exciting and so fulfilling!</p>
									
									<p><strong>As a coach what’s the most effective way you’ve found to grow your practice?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Be yourself, focus on what you are good at, and know your worth.</p>
									
									<p><strong>What breaks your heart, and how do you use that as a resource for growth and making a difference in the world?</strong></p>
									
									<p>My heart gets broken when I experience people who are driven by their saboteur(s) and are so inward looking that they miss out being fulfilled. I use that experience as a reminder that connection and collaboration are two of the things that make the world go around.  </p>
									
									<p><strong>Where would you most like to see the Co-Active approach making a difference in the world?</strong></p>
									
									<p>My belief is that everyone has the capacity to operate in a Co-Active way.  </p>
									
									<p>The strength of the model is its balance between Feminine and Masculine energy.  If you’ve heard Karen Kimsey-House talk you will hear more about the feminine or ‘Co’ of relationship, connection, intimacy, listening and love and Masculine of ‘Active’ of strength, achievement, personal power, intention and commitment.</p>
									
									<p>We are all of these things and many, many more (to coin a phrase) and I get excited every time I introduce one more corporate executive or one more coach in training to the concept that they can be more of who they already are by trusting the material, trusting themselves, and designing their alliance with themselves so that they can lean in and deeply connect to who they really are.  Magical.</p>
									
									<p>Knowing that there are times to step back, take a break, nurture and reflect before starting back on the learning journey once again. </p>
									
									<p><strong>Tell us what you do for fun?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I sing with my choir, I love to go down the gym 3 or 4 times a week.  I love the Theatre.  I go to a fitness boot camp a couple of times a year.  I try to do something scary too. The latest was Comedy Improv acting lessons.</p>
									
									<p>The comedy Improv lessons were a great reminder to me of how we are programmed to ‘know’ stuff and get stuff ‘right’. With improv the skill is being present and open to give to and take from your partner(s) and it's about making your partner(s) and/or the audience look good and giving them a good time.  It helps me stay grounded in the present and alert. It is also a great reminder to me of how much fun and how creative two or more human beings can be when they look to create from each other as opposed to compete with each other.  It supports my growth as a Coach and Leader by helping me be spontaneous and have that feeling of aliveness, maybe aliveness is a better word than scary. What I will say is at this point in my own development I find it hard to differentiate between fear and excitement! </p>
									
									<p>I love to have a nice meal with good company and a few drinks with close friends.  A long walk by the Thames...All of the above and much, much more.</p>
									
									<p><strong>And, your wildest ambition, you are willing to share publicly?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I plan to take a year-long sabbatical from mid-year 2012 into 2013 and my wildest ambition is to spend 3-6 months working on a volunteer project somewhere abroad.</p>
									
									<p>Africa appeals to me, I have a potential opportunity to work with a great friend and colleague of mine doing some conflict resolution work. Now, that would tick a lot of boxes for me.  Failing that, maybe somewhere in South America.  I am and have been trying to learn Spanish for some time, so three or six months in a Spanish-speaking country doing this kind of work would work for me on many levels.</p>
									
									<p>Working on a project that takes me outside of my comfort zone, whilst making a difference to people’s lives.  By the way, I know they will also make a difference to my life too!</p>
