          <p class="style84"><br />
            Hello Co-active Coaches,</p>
          <p class="style70">I’m very excited to announce the launch of a new CTI program, <strong>Breakaway Marketing for Coaching</strong> and to invite you to our initial pilot here in the Bay Area on <strong>August 14 and 15</strong>.</p>
          <p class="style70">Over the past years, I’ve spoken with many CTI coaches about what they need to ensure business success as a Co-active Coach.  What they’ve told me over and over again is that they want  a proven, up to date, no nonsense approach offered by marketing professionals and presented in a way that is experiential and fun. So, in partnership with a top-notch marketing company, we’ve created Breakaway Marketing for Coaching to bring you the most effective techniques for business success in today’s changing market.</p>
          <p class="style70">For the August pilot, we’re offering a special price of <strong>only $450</strong>. After the pilot, the tuition for the course will be $895. At this price, space will go quickly so you’ll want to call CTI right way at (xxx-xxx-xxxx) to grab a spot.</p>
          <p class="style70"><strong>Breakaway Marketing for Coaching</strong> is designed to capitalize on the great coaching training you received from CTI. It’s co-led and interactive with lots of hands-on learning as well being packed full with up-to-date information and tools that you can begin using right away. In this 2 day course you will:</p>
        <ul class="style70">
          <li class="style82">Create a custom designed marketing plan for your coaching business.</li>
		  <li class="style82">Develop the skills and tools needed to implement that plan successfully.</li>
          <li class="style82">Learn how to get new clients right away.</li>
		  <li class="style82">Discover specific strategies to engage visitors on your website.</li>
		  <li class="style82">Learn how social networking on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter can bring in new business.</li>
		</ul>
        
          <p class="style70">At the end of the course, we’ll be asking you for your input, so you’ll have an opportunity to contribute to the future design and success of the program as well.</p>
          <p class="style70">If you’d like to know more about the course, I’ll be hosting a <strong>special free teleconference call</strong> on July 30 at 12:00 noon PDT. To register for the call <em>(INSTRUCTIONS FOR REGISTERING FOR THE CALL)</em></p>
          <p class="style70">During the call I’ll introduce you to Martha Hanlon and Chris Williams of <strong>Market OUT LOUD,</strong> who are creating the program in collaboration with CTI. Market OUT LOUD specializes in marketing for small businesses and has worked with over 2,400 entrepreneurs, many coaches just like you, to build business success.</p>
          <p class="style70">With the launch of Breakaway, it’s our intention for CTI to be the very best place to learn the skills <em>and</em> business of coaching. Please join us in our commitment to your accelerating success and growth!</p>
          <p class="style70"><br />
            With gratitude,<br />
