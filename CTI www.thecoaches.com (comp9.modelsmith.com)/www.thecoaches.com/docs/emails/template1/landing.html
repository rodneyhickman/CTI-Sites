          <h1 style="font-size: 19px; font-weight:normal;">Greetings Co-Active Community</h1>
          <p>This morning, on my way in to the office, I was bathed in a sudden cascade of blossoms from the flowering trees. Spring has come to Marin County!</p>
          <p>It's not that I hadn't noticed...it's just that I hadn't NOTICED! I hadn't really taken the time to s-l-o-wwwww down, breathe in the freshness and really connect to the rhythm of the earth. I'd been much too busy paying attention to what was happening with the economy, with my country and in the world. I'd been going here and going there (a recent fabulous trip to Amsterdam), meeting wonderful people and having incredible conversations. I'd been focused and intentional. I'd been COMMITTED.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, nature was doing its thing. The days were getting longer, the buds on the trees were turning an unbelievable shade of green, and the things that flower were getting all geared up for the big &quot;Yee Hah!&quot; that is Spring. </p>
          <p>I realized that days had passed since I had taken the time to really savor the beauty all around me and the great, good gift of being alive. I decided that it was time to cultivate a good case of &quot;Spring Fever&quot; and roll around in the grass with a good book and a bottle of wine. Or just sit and watch the fog roll in over San Francisco Bay.</p>
          <p>Yes, these are &quot;turbulent times,&quot; as the media loves to say, and each day there is fresh news about the challenges that we face. Yes, I do believe that it is a time of transformation and powerful change, and we all need to step up.</p>
          <p>Paradoxically, it is wildly important, at the same time, that we not take ourselves too seriously; that we continue to cultivate the ability to laugh at the ridiculousness of being human. It's vital that we take care to appreciate the seemingly small things that make a life so rich: the way the air smells after it has rained, the golden color of the light at dusk, the magical shimmer of a full moon as it floats in the night sky, and too many other details to ever list.</p>
          <p>Whatever our portfolios are doing and whatever happens on Wall Street, we are wealthy beyond compare, bathed in the beauty of the world around us and blessed with riches of experience, heart and love. </p>
          <p>Wherever you are as you read this, pause for a moment and find something to chuckle about. Find something clever or amusing about yourself that is funny and charming. Now let your eyes wander and rest on something beautiful. You probably won't even need to get up out of your chair--beauty is that near at hand.</p>
          <p>Me, I'm tickled by my own foolish self-importance and am looking at the blue, blue Bay outside my window. The fog will be along at any moment.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Blessings,</strong></em><br />

      <p>A common question that lands in my mailbox at networksupport@thecoaches.com is &quot;What happened to my Daily Digest emails from the Co-Active Network?&quot; It is a reasonable question. But we're dealing here with technology and that's rarely reasonable. The path from the server that hosts the Co-Active Network to your email inbox is treacherous and fraught with dangers for the Daily Digest. Here are a few suggestions that will increase the odds that the Daily Digest will successfully complete the journey.</p>
      <p>Because the Digests are an automated email, it is possible that your email service is blocking them on your behalf. The larger service providers (AOL, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) change their filtering rules on a regular basis, so what was getting through a few days ago may now get caught in a net you didn't even know was put up. Also common are spam filters that gobble up messages from the Co-Active Network. Missing your Digest? Check your settings.</p>
      <p>To help make sure that your email service provider or spam filter is not screening out messages that you want to receive, add these &quot;From&quot; email address for the daily digests to your address book: Public_Discussions@coactivenetwork.com<br />
        members-only_Discussions@coactivenetwork.com </p>
      <p>If you have the option, set your spam filter to accept all email from coactivenetwork.com. You may need to contact your email service provider or search their help files to learn more about how to improve the odds that Co-Active Network Daily Digests reach your email inbox.</p>
      <p>Now that I'm finished conveying important and useful information, let's move on to lighter fare. There's lots of great stuff going on in all the niche and geographic communities.</p>
      <p>The other day, I was looking at the Main Community Calendar and noticed some cheeky events listed. The Recovery Uncovered niche community has an event titled &quot;Let’s Play,&quot; scheduled for Wednesday, March 25. Who among you will answer, &quot;I’m game!&quot; And on Tuesday, April 7, the Women as Leaders community will be working on how &quot;Chicks Can Make Cents.&quot; Watch out world!</p>
    <p>You might also be interested in catching the recordings of past events like &quot;How to Capture Revenue in a Cost-Conscious Economy,&quot; hosted by the Career Coaching community. Or the event from the Creative Artists niche that filled up their bridgeline: &quot;Dancing with Life.&quot; Rummage around in the Resources of your favorite communities--or better yet, a community you've never visited. See what you find. There's some really good stuff out there to be found.</p>

      <p>Three Leadership tribes have launched their experience at our new east coast program location, Bend of Ivy, in North Carolina. One Leadership tribe has graduated already at Bend of Ivy.</p>
      <p>Three more Leadership tribes have launched their experience at Wildwood, our new West Coast facility. Nine Leadership tribes have graduated at Almiral de la Font in Spain.</p>
    <p>Would you like to be counted among the number of participants or graduates of the Leadership Program? A small number of openings are available in West Coast programs starting in April and May.

      <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/emails/template1/images/green_business.gif" alt="Green Business" width="169" height="189" align="left" />Who would have guessed that our humble beginnings as a small committee aiming to make a sustainable difference within the CTI office would shepherd the company through a rigorous process to become green-certified by a program that spans nine Bay Area counties? It's official. CTI is now a green-certified business through the Bay Area Green Business Program, joining more than 1,700 other green-certified businesses.</p>
      <p>In fact, CTI activities exceeded BAGBP's basic requirements. For instance, we recycle and re-use course materials like bandanas, chimes, fans, markers, leaders' course outlines, and packing and shipping material. That makes many of our long-standing processes green, too. More recently, all student documentation for our Leadership program is handled electronically through Launchpad and i-Cohere technology, saving CTI approximately 8,664 pieces of paper (or 17.3 reams) in 2009. Look for the &quot;Bay Area Green Business&quot; logo, which will soon begin to appear on materials produced by CTI.</p>
      <p>We welcome your ideas and suggestions for making CTI even greener in 2009--please contact Catherine Walker, our Sustainability Coordinator, at 415.526.1652 or catherine@thecoaches.com. To find out more about the Bay Area Green Business Program, visit http://www.greenbiz.ca.gov/AboutUs.html. </p>
    <p>Maria Cunningham, who originally introduced the green initiative to management, found inspiration in the Green MBA program at Dominican University, near our office in San Rafael, CA. If you are looking for help in &quot;greening&quot; your organization, please contact them. Dominican's mission statement reads: &quot;Dominican University of California's MBA in Sustainable Enterprise is an engaging learning community where people with strong environmental and social values develop effective leadership capabilities to advance economically successful, ecologically restorative, and socially just initiatives in any type of organization.&quot; Visit www.greenmba.com or phone 415.458.3737 for more information on supporting your company's journey toward green.</p>

      <p>In mid-December, Karen Kimsey-House and Sabrina Roblin travelled to South Korea to conduct leader auditions in support of CTI partners Ken and Susan Gimm in South Korea and Igshaan Soules in South Africa. More than a dozen candidates from those two countries participated in the auditions.</p>
      <p>It was an experiment in support of the growth and development of these partners, and the process went really well. This approach allows the partners to grow their business as quickly as possible using local talent. Karen and Sabrina were impressed with the candidates and chose one leader from South Africa and six from South Korea. </p>
      <p>Karen noted &quot;it is always interesting to hold auditions in a different culture, and this was no exception. Auditionees were so vulnerable.&quot;</p>
      <p>Auditions were held at CTI Korea's beautiful new building in downtown Seoul. They have a big vision for Co-Active Coaching and how it might support the growth and expansion of their country. Seoul really bustles, and the local Co-Active Coaching community reflects that.</p>
      <p><strong>Fast Forward to Mid-February 2009</strong><br />
    A Coach Training course was held mid-February in South Korea. The group sent a video greeting we want to share with the entire CTI community. Love the enthusiasm!</p>

      <p><strong>Introducing CTI’s Compass Power Team</strong><br />
        This dedicated group of CTI-trained coaches is working to bring the collaborative opportunity of Compass to coaches and clients everywhere. The Compass Power Team works together co-actively to support and champion each other in building their practices and helping others build theirs.<br />

      <p><strong>JOYCE ORECCHIA</strong><br />
        Faced with ending a 34-year corporate career due to offshore manufacturing, Joyce took the opportunity to reinvent herself and create something that incorporated the coaching, mentoring and empowerment opportunities of her corporate career. Blessed by CTI's coaching program, which was in alignment with her values and spiritual beliefs, Joyce found Compass. While listening to a Compass info call, her heart began pounding and Joyce felt she had found her home. Joyce is now empowering women through group coaching and personal development programs, using the turn-key Compass business model. In Joyce's words, &quot;A match made in heaven.&quot; <br />
        Joyce (CPCC in progress) is from Northern California.<br />

      <p><strong>CHRISTINE (WAECHTER) STILLER </strong><br />
        With integrity and authenticity as her biggest values, Christine has developed a radar system. She &quot;sniffed&quot; her way through several Compass info calls to see what her radar would reveal. Christine listened. She read. She asked questions. She met Compass leaders. And her radar screening came up empty. What Christine found felt truly profound: Leadership with a huge vision, a team dedicated to her success, an endless supply of encouragement, and the confidence to get out there and be the leader she always knew she was. Christine's personal success has inspired her to build a team to bring the mission of Compass to the world. <br />

      <p><strong>THOMAS COGSWELL</strong><br />
        One morning, when Thomas was about to surrender from building his coaching practice to find a job, he found himself on a conference call about Compass. Halfway through the call, Thomas was on the Compass website joining as a representative. Job search averted, Thomas joined Compass opportunities for training and business development. Reflecting on the experience, Thomas asks, &quot;Remember 'Synergy'? You defied gravity because you knew someone had your back. This kind of support elicits action, action begets results, results are shared; then, presto, a community that one is proud to be a part of grows.”<br />

      <p><strong>NONA WRIGHT </strong><br />
        Shortly after a CTI Compass info call, Nona got on a plane to San Francisco for the first annual Compass event. She interviewed to become a Compass coach. The Compass vision of making coaching accessible to all women, while empowering coaches to make a decent living appeals to Nona. After more than 30 years as a Mental Health Nurse, Nona sees coaching as her calling. As a new entrepreneur, with little business background but a strong urge to serve others, the Compass opportunity has been ideal for Nona. The integrity and generosity at Compass inspires Nona. <br />
