									<p>Hello fellow Co-active Coaches and Leaders:</p>
									
									<p>Here at CTI, we’ve been experimenting with new material to add to our curriculum for organizations. Because our work is so highly experiential, we need to pilot our new designs before we roll them out. If you have experience working in a corporate environment, we want to invite you to participate.</p>
									
									<p>We’ll be doing a pilot on April 21 and 22 at CTI Headquarters in San Rafael with space for 20 volunteers. Some of the material we are covering will be familiar, however a lot of what we will be doing will be brand new content.</p>
									
									<p>WHAT WE NEED:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Participants who have had experience working in corporate environments.<br /></li>
										<li>Your willingness to participate and engage fully with the learning.</li>
										<li>Your feedback.</li>
										<li>A maximum of 20 people.</li>
										
									</ul>
									<p>WHAT YOU GET:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A 2-day, CTI workshop experience filled with fun and lots of learning. In exchange for your participation and feedback, we’ll waive the course fee.</li>
										<li>A chance to work with CTI founder Karen Kimsey-House and senior course leader John Vercelli. </li>
										<li>A chance to be on the cutting edge of what’s emerging in our Co-Active work.</li>
										<li>An opportunity to learn new tools that you can begin using right away in your life.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>As a pilot participant, we’ll need you to be present from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm for both days. It will be important for you to stay through to the end of each day, especially the last day, as we’ll want to debrief the experience and collect your feedback.</p>
									
									<p>To register call 415-451-6000 (option 7) to speak to a Customer Service Representative. This program will fill very quickly so you’ll want to move fast to register.</p>
									
									<p>Please note that this pilot program is not ICF approved and you will not earn CEUs by attending.</p>
									
									<p>Look forward to seeing you there!</p>
									<p>With much excitement,</p>
									<p>Karen Kimsey-House<br />
									CEO and Co-Founder</p>
