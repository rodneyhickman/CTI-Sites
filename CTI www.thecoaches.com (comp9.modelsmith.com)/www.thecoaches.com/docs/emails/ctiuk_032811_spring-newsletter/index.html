									<p>When you make cookies, or biscuits as we call them in the UK, we roll out the dough and then use a uniformly shaped cutter to cut out circles, or whatever shape takes your fancy.  Once cooked, they all, invariably, look and taste the same.  And so they should, if you&rsquo;re aiming at pleasing friends and family at afternoon tea. </p>
									
									<p>However, this kind of homogeneity, from our point of view, doesn&rsquo;t work in coaching.</p>
									
									<p>Yes, the Co-active<span style="font-size: 9px; position: relative; top: -6px;">&reg;</span> model does appear to be a fixed schematic, and yet in practice it&rsquo;s quite the contrary.  The Co-active model is uniquely designed to allow the full range of who the coach is as a person &ndash; who they are being &ndash; to be authentically present in the coaching relationship.</p>
									
									<p>Indeed, this ability to find your own unique style of coaching, without hiding whom you are, in all your magic as a human being, is why we believe Co-active coaching is so popular today &ndash; accounting for some 50% of coaches trained each year.</p>
									
									<p>This theme is explored in our learning point this month, by Nick Martin&rsquo;s excellent article The White Space of Co-active Coaching, and just to be sure, if you are in doubt, we profile the very unique Simon Ireland Davies, CPCC, Managing Director of Striding Out, in our Co-active profile.</p>
									
									<p>Elsewhere, there&rsquo;s information about the visit of Karen Kimsey-House, CTI founder and author of seminal coaching text, <em>Co-active Coaching</em>, to the UK.  Be sure to register your interest in attending one of these events as soon as possible.</p>
									
									<p>Finally, for a full list of our forthcoming courses, including our next London and Manchester Fundamentals (our next two and half day introductory course), <a href="http://www.coaching-courses.com/coach-training/dates-and-locations/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #689bbc !important;">click here</a>, or for more information, please email our senior program advisor, Judy Rich <a href="mailto:judy@thecoaches.com" style="color: #689bbc !important;">judy@thecoaches.com</a> or by phone +44 (0)845 299 8199.</p>

									<p><em style="color: #689bbc !important;">&ldquo;Inspiration, buzz, learning, stretching ourselves as coaches, stretching ourselves as a community, excitement, fun, humour.&rdquo;</em></p>
									
									<p>Those are just some of the words we came up with when we had our very first  meeting to put together the May 6th Co-active Community Day.</p>
									
									<p>It took us more time to work out how we wanted to focus the day.  And after much chewing and discussing, we decided we wanted to explore the idea of being authentic as coaches. Authenticity gives us a bigger impact on our clients and on the world around us.  We connect with others. We connect with what is needed in the world. We look beyond ourselves and our own interests and we begin to realise we can co-create a vision of the world we all share and want to live in.</p>
									
									<p>After we agreed that this was our focus, this was our stake &ndash; well it seemed clear the types of speakers and workshop leaders we needed to have at this day.  We wanted people who have made an impact, who are committed to making a difference.  We wanted people who will INSPIRE us &ndash; who will call us forth as coaches to stretch and move into new territory.</p>
									
									<p>And WOW &ndash; we went out and we enrolled these very people!</p>
									
									<p><strong>Dave Ellis</strong> is one of the foremost coaches in the world today. Starting out in the late 80's when coaching was in it's infancy, he made his millions through a best-selling book aimed at coaching college and university students.  Not content to simply rest on his laurels or use his wealth to improve his own life, he set up the Brande Foundation which provides pro-bono coaching to not-for-profit leaders who are seeking to eradicate poverty.  He puts the profits he makes coaching high net-worth individuals towards the Foundation.  He has coached Nobel Prize winners and top sports people.  Based in California, he is flying over specially to teach us about his coaching model and how to have the biggest possible impact in the world.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Karen Kimsey-House</strong> is an impressive and powerful role model for the impact you can have when you are truly authentic.  She was co-founder of CTI, co-author of the book <em>Co-active Coaching</em> and is the CEO of CTI.  If you are a Co-active coach, you have been seriously impacted by this woman!  We are fortunate that Karen was able to be a late addition to the programme of the day and will be joining us and participating with us.  She will lead us in a Q&amp;A session at the end of the day providing a unique opportunity to talk with Karen!</p>
									
									<p><strong>Nick Martin and Ronnie Clifford</strong> will be leading us on a journey to explore our shadows, look at our reactive patterns of leadership and see how we can begin to stretch into more creative and life-affirming ways of being and leading in the world.  Their workshop will use the Leadership Circle model as a starting point and we are pleased to announce that ICF continuing education credits will be available for those taking part in this workshop!</p>
									
									<p>So, these are the main speakers and leaders.</p>
									
									<p>But, what we know is really going to make this day great is YOUR participation!  It'll be all the Co-active coaches in the room co-creating the buzz and excitement.  It'll be your willingness to step up, stretch yourself, move into the unknown, challenge yourselves, have new conversations with others.  Whether you have just finished core curriculum or whether you've been around the block as a Co-active coach, you are what is going to make the day powerful and exciting!</p>
									
									<p>Join us. Sign up. Co-create the future you want for the coaching community. You are the one we have been waiting for.</p>

									<h2 class="turquoise" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: normal;">The White Space of Co-active Coaching</h2>
									<p><strong>By Nick Martin, CPCC, and CTI Coach Training Leader</strong></p>
									<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
										<tr>
											<td valign="top" >
												<img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/emails/ctiuk/images/img_wheel-sculpture.jpg" style="margin-right:18px;" />
											</td>
											<td valign="bottom">
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I like to think of the Co-active Coaching model as a wheel &ndash; after all, that is exactly what it looks like.  A wheel has a rim (the Designed Alliance), a hub (the three Principles of Fulfillment, Balance and Process), and spokes (the five Contexts of Listening, Curiosity, Intuition, Forward the Action &amp; Deepen the Learning, and Self-Management).  A wheel also has a purpose, similar to that of the Co-active Coaching model, which is to provide support and the capacity for movement.
.</p>
									
											</td>
										</tr>
									</table>
									
									<p>In between the parts of the wheel, and between the wheel and the entity that it supports (the client in this case), we can see light &ndash; the white space. </p>  
									
									<p>However, this white space is not empty.</p>
									
									<p>On the contrary, it is filled with the coach and what he or she brings to the coaching.  The white space is what provides the energy and momentum for the wheel to move.  Without the coach and his or her own personality, the Co-active Coaching model is just a model.</p>  
									
									<p>Who we are, and what we dare to bring to the coaching, brings the model to life.</p>
									
									<p>Firstly, it is the &lsquo;being&rsquo; of the coach which allows the wheel to turn (animates the model).  Co-active coaching is so much more than just a set of tools.  It includes &ndash; and demands &ndash; that we bring all of who we are, so that we find our own unique way of working.</p>
									
									<p>At the risk of metaphor overload here, white light is made up of all the colours of the spectrum.  An important element of the &lsquo;Synergy&rsquo; course is the idea of range.  Relating this to the spectrum of light, we all have the capacity for all of the colours.  Some of us might fall more easily into the &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; part of the spectrum of coaching, while others might be more &lsquo;green&rsquo;, and others again are naturally more &lsquo;violet&rsquo;.  (You can make up for yourself what those colours might mean, and how they might manifest in coaching.)</p>
									
									<p>Our coaching will be more alive, and more effective, if we bring in more colour, more of who we are, including the parts of us that we tend to hide.  After all, this is one of the things that we are helping many of our clients to achieve, so we owe it to us and to them to work on this ourselves.</p>
									
									<p>What &lsquo;colour&rsquo; is your own particular style of coaching?  </p>
									
									<p>Which &lsquo;colours&rsquo; do you avoid, and how might they transform your coaching if you included them?</p>
									
									<p>Just to be clear here &ndash; I am certainly not advocating that we all become &lsquo;white&rsquo; coaches in the sense that we all bring exactly the same combination of colour so that we all look the same.  On the contrary, I want us all to develop our own unique way of being that both supports the model and makes us stand out and be different.</p>
									
									<p>The &lsquo;white space&rsquo; of coaching is also where we leave behind the &lsquo;beginner&rsquo;s mind&rsquo; agreement that is part of the CTI courses &ndash; except &lsquo;Synergy&rsquo;.  When I was a participant on the CTI courses I remember one of the leaders telling us that the first four courses are all about giving us the manual for Co-active coaching, and Synergy is all about us tearing up the manual and finding our own way.</p>
									
									<p>Not only do we each find our own way of being as coaches, but I am also always fascinated and delighted when I hear of the many creative ways which people find to combine Co-active coaching with other skills and approaches.  There are Co-active coaches who take their clients walking (I am one of them), or climbing.  There are coaches who use dance, cookery, drama, and pottery to support their one-to-one work and their workshops.  I would include all of these possibilities in the &lsquo;white space&rsquo;.  They all add colour, flavour and uniqueness to the coaching experience.</p>
									
									<p>Finally, the &lsquo;white space&rsquo; is also where we discover more about ourselves, both as coaches and as human beings.  One of the things I believe all Co-active coaches have in common is the commitment to our own growth and development.  Find me a Co-active coach who has never had the experience of finding a connection between a client&rsquo;s issue and something going on in his or her own life, and I will show you someone who is missing the point.  It is only by continuing our own self-discovery that we can truly be of service to our clients.  The process of writing this article has forced me to think of where I need to develop my own range, both as a coach and a leader of CTI courses.  (More &lsquo;red&rsquo; is at least part of the answer to that, and again I will leave you to make up what that might mean.)</p>
									
									<p>Awareness of the white space may be just what is needed to provide some lubrication to the wheel of the Co-active Coaching model from time to time.</p>
									
									<p>So, where do <strong>you</strong> need to apply some oil?</p>
									
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p><em><span style="font-size: 11px;">I would like to thank Jim Patterson for the concept of the &lsquo;white space&rsquo; of coaching, which provided the original inspiration for this article.  Any distortions of Jim&rsquo;s idea are entirely my own.</span></em></p>

												<p><strong>To begin with, would you tell us which part of the Co-active model had the biggest emotional impact on you when you took CTI&rsquo;s Fundamentals course?</strong></p>
												
												<p>Process. As a &lsquo;Corporate Boy&rsquo; it fascinated and terrified me. I operated in an environment where it was a million light years away from what we talked about at work and I was so disconnected from it that even the demo left me cold. Everyone around me was saying how profound the demo was and I just didn&rsquo;t get it. I even thought those people who thought it was great were lying! The joys of a Saboteur running free... I dreaded the full Process weekend in the Core Curriculum but actually it was the most resonant for me. I connected with who I am and it&rsquo;s become an anchor for my coaching. I believe that Process is probably the most distinctive part of the Co-active model when comparing it with other coaching schools. </p>

									<p><strong>How has that deepened over the years since taking the course?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Everything was very &lsquo;segmented&rsquo; after the training, as the years have gone on (I trained over five years ago) the model becomes a softer focus, with the individual elements becoming a beautiful melange where it all overlaps and drives itself. Process is now everywhere and not just an &lsquo;ok let&rsquo;s explore process now!&rsquo;.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Today, what does it mean to you to &lsquo;Be&rsquo; Co-active, generally...</strong></p> 
									
									<p>Synergy is totally the right name for the last weekend of Core Curriculum, that last weekend was the start of a journey all in itself. After spending a period of time being so focused on the &lsquo;doing&rsquo; of coaching, which thanks to my saboteur was also a big focus in Certification for a while, the &lsquo;being&rsquo; place of Co-activity informs everything &ndash; it&rsquo;s become a way of life.</p>
																		
									<p><strong>in your personal life... </strong></p> 
									
									<p>Relationships are different, many are better, richer and deeper, although some are tougher. One of my family used to cry anytime she got challenged by me, and I remember a conversation just after Process where I voiced something important to me  and she started crying, I stayed silent and waited, she said “I&rsquo;m sorry I know you don&rsquo;t like it when I cry” and I replied “It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ve done some training, cry as much as you feel like and we&rsquo;ll carry on when you&rsquo;re ready”. She stopped crying immediately, as she realised it no longer had power over me. She&rsquo;s not cried at me for five years and it was a huge wake up about how people use emotions to take power &ndash; and even more so how our saboteurs do it to us and make us weak and small.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>and in your primary relationships?</strong></p> 
									
									<p>When training, my husband Neil was a dummy client for me one weekend when the person I had lined up couldn&rsquo;t make it. He said he didn&rsquo;t want to do it and I guilted him into doing it &ndash; not my most Co-active moment! I realised when 10 minutes into the call he asked me if &lsquo;<em>shouting was one of the coaching techniques they taught you</em>&rsquo; that I had to be aware of the impact of coaching people I was too close to, or who hadn&rsquo;t asked for it. We still laugh about that call all these years later.</p>
									
									<p>Neil got curious enough to go on Fundamentals, which was a huge help and eradicated the “don&rsquo;t coach me!” whenever we disagreed on something. The funny bit for me was that I wasn&rsquo;t trying to coach him &ndash; it had just become how I spoke, how I asked questions and how I saw the world. It was difficult at first as I&rsquo;d shed a lot of stuff that I had thought was important to me, and we both had to adjust to what was there now. I think I collaborate much more since the training.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>You are currently Managing Director of Striding Out, based in the North West of England, with franchises nationwide who provide coaching and mentoring to young people.  What impact do you see Co-active coaching have with young men and women in helping them achieve their potential?</strong></p>
									
									<p>It&rsquo;s huge. I just read our community impact report for 2010 and it&rsquo;s humbling, inspiring, enraging (that our society even needs it &ndash; we are failing the young people in our country) and more emotions than you can shake a stick at.</p>
									
									<p>Last year we provided 3500 unemployed young people with mini career-coaching sessions, CV and interview guidance, then supported 800 of them on a longer term basis, to assist them into sustainable employment, education or training. We placed 520 young people into newly-created job opportunities with 129 employers. Delivered over 70 training workshops to 640 young people who have been placed into job opportunities.  The list goes on and on. Our coaches are proving that you can make a great living as a coach whilst working with clients who are aligned with your values.</p>
									
									<p>Our coaches are not exclusively CTI alumni, though it&rsquo;s definitely the dominant group. Co-activity therefore shows up throughout the organisation and in our approach to how we lead training and development that we do. I&rsquo;m so proud that the Co-active coaches within Striding Out are taking co-activity to a whole new group &ndash; people that can&rsquo;t afford corporate rates. </p>
									
									<p>We work with people who&rsquo;ve never been asked any questions because they&rsquo;ve already been written off. We change that. My current favourite story (I&rsquo;ll have a new one next week) is the young woman who pitched up for her first coaching session with the perspective that she had to be an admin assistant because she&rsquo;d been told to. She didn&rsquo;t even really understand what an admin role was. An hour later she&rsquo;d (bravely for her) shared her dream of being a trainer and 3 months later is a self employed trainer with contracts all over the show and 2 qualifications (one through Striding Out) and so much confidence.</p>
									
									<p>Co-active coaching changed her life, and she didn&rsquo;t have to pay a penny for it!</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What advice do you have to other Co-active coaches with a desire to work as coaches in the voluntary or public sectors?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Obviously I have to start by saying come explore owning your own Striding Out franchise! Though in all seriousness, it depends what you want to do and whether you want to get paid. If you want to get paid it&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder to do it as a sole trader, more and more pre-qualification questionnaires are deselecting firms if their turnover is too small. Same goes for trading history, it&rsquo;s harder for new businesses to enter the marketplace.</p>
									
									<p>Therefore, piggybacking as an Associate for companies that have these contracts is a way in, or becoming a Franchisee for organisations that do have the trading history and turnover that will get you over that first hurdle. Plus it&rsquo;s tons more fun doing it as part of a team.</p>
									
									<p>If you have the luxury of not needing a salary, then find an organisation that aligns with your values and go offer your time. It&rsquo;s hugely rewarding.</p>
									
									<p>And whether it&rsquo;s paid or voluntary, do Certification. Our profession needs the rigour it gives. And join ICF and sign up to some professional standards. And get insurance. Most public sector contracts want you to carry between £2-5 million in liability insurance. It costs less than you might think.</p>
									
									<p>It may be a not for profit sector &ndash; but it still expects certain standards.</p>
									
									<p>Most important of all is a passion for the sector. These can be clients who don&rsquo;t play by the rules and who often don&rsquo;t play nice. We have coaches come meet us who wax lyrical about working with young people, but they mean young people from nice upper middle class homes who turn up on time, are always polite and are always a joy to be around. This sector is not like that. We work with some amazing young people, and they can be a stretch to work with. Working in this sector demands authenticity and great skills &ndash; and more dancing in the moment than a whole TV series of Strictly Come Dancing. If you can connect with them, be relatable and build trust, the rewards are incredible, but it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p>
									
									<p>Plus, you can&rsquo;t take yourself seriously working with this client group &ndash; they can deflate an ego at 100 yards. You need to be confident in your abilities to work with them.</p>
									
									<p>If you&rsquo;re going after a 3rd sector contract:</p>
									
									<ul>
										<li>Have a track record &ndash; they&rsquo;ll want references and to know that you have the experience to make the contract work</li>
										<li>Understand what you&rsquo;re selling &ndash; both in terms of pricing and outputs/outcomes the funder/tender expects</li>
										<li>Have your policies and procedures in place &ndash; jokes about Health and Safety are all very funny &ndash; but the risks are real and if negligent you&rsquo;ll get sued</li>
										<li>Have some partners already lined up &ndash; if you say you&rsquo;ll work with &lsquo;x&rsquo; number of people where will you find them? Who will refer to you? People won&rsquo;t refer their client group to you from a cold start &ndash; normally you need a relationship</li>
										<li>Deliver what the tender wants &ndash; so many 3rd sector bids fail because businesses ignore what the client wants and just submits their &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; product.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>How hard was it to mothball your own company and go work for Striding Out?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Probably the toughest decision of my 30s. Leaving my job as Head of Coaching for O2 to go and set up my own company in 2007 was huge but it wasn&rsquo;t hard. It was financially difficult, a rollercoaster of highs and lows and finally realising that I could make it financially viable, fulfilling and fun. I joined Striding Out as a part-time Franchisee Coach in summer 2009 and immediately felt different &ndash; I had all the joy of self employment with the sense of being part of something bigger. I had an amazing 18 months. Then when our founder, the incredible Heather Wilkinson, decided she wanted to pursue new projects as well as go travelling, I was called forth, but fought it for ages. I knew that it would mean coaching a fraction of what I currently did and that seemed unthinkable. It was also not true, I&rsquo;m probably using my coaching skills more than ever &ndash; they just probably wouldn&rsquo;t get through an ICF audit as &lsquo;pure coaching&rsquo;!</p>
									
									<p>I think the other thing that&rsquo;s different is the sense of ownership, it does feel just as much my company as the company I formed was, ownership is a state of mind not a piece of paper. I&rsquo;m so proud of what we do and the force of change that we are in our society. Striding Out is a community interest company, so as a social enterprise it&rsquo;s very different from the world of shareholders etc.
</p> 
									
									<p><strong>How do you use the Co-active coaching model to recover on the bad days?</strong></p>
									
									<p>What bad days?</p>
									
									<p>I have bad minutes and every now and then some bad hours &ndash; bad days are thankfully very few and far between. I find &lsquo;what do you want to happen next?&rsquo; solves most challenges, either self imposed or when dealing with other people. It shifts the energy to the present and future, rather than staying a victim to the past. So I guess I use curiosity and powerful questions when it gets sticky. Plus some “take charge” and “fierce courage”.</p> 
									
									<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the biggest surprise that you&rsquo;ve found as a result of training in and working with the Co-active coaching model?</strong></p>
									
									<p>The community that comes along with it. The model is exceptional and is an amazing resource, however it&rsquo;s the fantastically rich pool of skills, knowledge and wisdom that comes with being part of the community which really made the difference for me. Get involved in your regional group if you don&rsquo;t already. The North West group has been incredibly helpful to me and I hope I&rsquo;ve also contributed..</p>
									
									<p><strong>As a coach what&rsquo;s the most effective way you&rsquo;ve found to grow your practice?</strong></p>

									<ol style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; width: 100%; text-align: left;">
										<li>Niche. My own business growth was linked to the day I chose a niche. It made it much easier for clients to claim me as their coach and for other people to refer to me.</li>
										<li>Credibility. There are so many &ldquo;1 wo/man bands&rdquo; out there and so many coaches get overly precious about business development that it&rsquo;s self sabotaging. If you choose to run a coaching business &ndash; make it business like. That means record keeping, marketing, planning and diligence. Our profession needs to be professional.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<p><strong>Tell us what you do for fun?</strong></p>
									
									<p>I play Everquest 2, an online Dungeons and Dragons type game. I&rsquo;ve got 3 clients through it over the 5 years I&rsquo;ve been playing it and supported many others, so much for it being an escape from the real world! The curiosity and powerful questions won&rsquo;t go away even when charging at an undead dragon... </p>
									
									<p>I spend many hours on trains between our various bases, so I podcast Radio 4 comedy. </p>
									
									<p><strong>Your wildest ambitions?</strong></p>
									
									<p>Nothing I could share in polite company :-)</p>
