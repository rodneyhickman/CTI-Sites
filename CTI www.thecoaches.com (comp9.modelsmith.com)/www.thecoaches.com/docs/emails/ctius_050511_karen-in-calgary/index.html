						<p style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height:17px; color: #311109;"><strong>The Co-Active Relationship: Three Keys to Transformative Conversations</strong></p>
						
						<p style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height:17px; color: #311109;">We each care deeply about the people in our lives and we yearn to be great at what we do. So often, however, our communication has a very different impact than the one we intend. The ability to engage in dynamic, alive and empowering relationship is a key factor for success in every area of our lives. This “relationship agility” is not so much a function of highly developed skills but rather a mindset and a lens through which we view others. This engaging and experiential evening will focus on three keys to connecting more deeply with ourselves and others so that we may engage in conversations that are truly transformative – ones that create lasting change in the relationship. It will be relevant for coaches, managers, leaders, parents and anyone wanting to have a transformational impact on the people they work with, lead and love.</p>
