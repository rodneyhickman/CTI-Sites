			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Here at CTI we hear from many people who are interested in the Co-Active Leadership Program yet hesitate to enroll due to concerns about the time commitment or the financial cost. Youâ€™ve experienced the power and value of Leadership and understand why we want to remove any barriers to attending. Think of one person in your life who would benefit from Co-active Leadership and hold them in your mind as you finish reading.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">To address the concerns of cost and commitment, CTI has created an alternate experience of Co-Active Leadership that addresses both issues: CTI will offer the first retreat from the Co-Active Leadership Program &ndash; <em>Creating from Self</em> &ndash; on a standalone basis.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">
				<strong>Dates:</strong> October 11 - 16, 2011<br />
				<strong>Location:</strong> <a href="http://www.marconiconference.org/">Marconi Conference Center</a> (north of San Francisco, near Point Reyes)<br />
				<strong>Leaders:</strong> Karen and Henry Kimsey-House (bonus!)<br />
				<strong>Cost:</strong> $2995 USD<br />
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">This Retreat may not be held as a standalone again. Think again of the person you know who would be interested in the Co-Active Leadership program and invite them <strong><em>right now</em></strong> to take advantage of this opportunity. Let that person know how the Co-Active Leadership Program impacted your life. Encourage them to sign up soon; there are only 23 spots left for this program and we expect them to fill quickly.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">No discount coupons may be applied to this special program, however, if the participant decides to continue on with the full program, discount coupons may be used. The amount paid for the standalone retreat will be credited toward full tuition.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Advise your special person to contact a Program Advisor right away at 415-451-6000 x3 or 800-691-6008 x3 to register or learn more.
