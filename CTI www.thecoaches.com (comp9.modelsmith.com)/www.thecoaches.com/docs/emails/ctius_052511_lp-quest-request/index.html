			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" style=" line-height: 23px; font-size: 19px;">Hello Co-Active Leadership Grad,</font></p>
			
			<p>Have you created an amazing Leadership Quest that has made a difference in some lives in a unique way? Did you apply what you learned from Leadership to transform your own life in obvious ways? If so, I would love to hear from you! I am looking for great stories of success from CTI’s Co-Active<sup style="font-size: 9px;">&reg;</sup> Leadership Program grads to share with the media and the world. You, your project and those whose lives have been impacted &ndash; or will be impacted &ndash; by your work could get free publicity if your story is chosen to be told by the media.</p>
			
			<p>If you want to participate, please send me a brief email describing your story, especially what makes it spectacular and newsworthy. Some people don’t feel certain what qualifies as a newsworthy story. It depends on the media, but when you hear the story yourself you say, “Wow”, that’s a good sign! The media are among the most cynical people on earth and it takes a lot to impress them. Ideally, I want stories that have <strong>1) Novelty</strong> &ndash; there is something about it that seems to be a first, unusual, counterintuitive or surprising; <strong>2) Success</strong> – a goal or positive outcome has been achieved; <strong>3) Timeliness</strong> &ndash; if the story ties into current events in the news, all the better, and <strong>4) Trendiness</strong> &ndash; it either leads, follows or bucks a trend. It’s about a meaningful shift that occurred as a result of using Co-Active tools and skills. But don’t let this discourage you: If your story is fascinating but doesn’t meet all that ideal criteria, I still want to hear about it!</p>
			
			<p>Please let me know if you have photos or videos to illustrate your story, as well. If your story sounds interesting, I will follow up to get more details. </p>
			
			<p>Thanks so much for spreading Co-Activity as you make a difference with your leadership. I want Co-Activity to expand into all corners of the world. If you do your part by doing great work and letting me know about it, I’ll do my part and alert the media! </p>
			
			<p>Cheers,<br />
