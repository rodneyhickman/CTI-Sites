	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>The European Co-Active Coaches Community

    </strong>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The French say that you plant a walnut tree for your grandchildren, not for yourself. The grand old tree provides nuts, shade and eventually great wood for furniture. But it takes such a long time to mature that you’ve long lost your teeth by the time the first nuts are ready for cracking. In the meantime, it can be a lot of fun watching the sapling sprout, broaden and reach towards the sun. Co-Activity in Europe feels a little like that at present. Our transatlantic sapling is beginning to add shoots and branches. 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So far we’ve held four community days. They’re non-profit days organised by volunteers from the Co-Active coaching community for the sake of building a network of effective and prosperous coaches. The next community day promises to be the biggest yet. We’re meeting in London on Friday, October 14, and the star attraction is a three-hour workshop run by Marita Fridjhon and Faith Fuller, the founders of Organisational & Relationship Systems Coaching. It will be a marvellous opportunity to sample a powerful way of coaching, both for individuals and in companies. Some of us were lucky enough to have a sneak preview at the International Coach Federation conference in Norway. Marita and Faith are bringing their full programme to Europe. Another great branch on our growing walnut tree!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The next European community day will also be graced by Henry and Karen Kimsey-House. They’ll be on their way to the first-ever Leadership program in Europe, to be held near Barcelona in Spain. We hope that this course will be just the first of many, so that Europe can produce as many Leadership graduates as the Americas. Karen and Henry will just be hanging out at this community day. But who says that we can’t put them to work at future events, especially as they’re committed to being in Europe at least three more times in 2006.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’ve also started a weekly bridge-line call on Tuesday mornings. The European Co-active Café call is open to one and all. Drop in for an exchange of news and information. It’s a great way of making connections. On the very first call, we had coaches from three different countries and the conversation led to coaches from Luxembourg and the Netherlands discovering each other. Details of the time and number for the call are on the European Co-Active Coaching network. We hope to make the calls a mixture of business and pleasure, of schmoozing and working. For instance, the first call touched on topics from software packages for running coaching practices to business development, as well as providing an opportunity to catch up with some old faces and meet some new ones. 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The European Co-Active Network site now has more than 100 members from 15 countries, and we are slowly trying to wean everyone off of the old Yahoo group. “I’ve been meaning to sign up for ages,” is an oft-repeated refrain. It takes less time to sign up than to down a double espresso. So please persuade all your Co-Active coaching contacts and colleagues to sign up forthwith. Be bold! Refuse to talk to them until they do so.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And finally, another date for your diaries: the next International Coach Federation conference in Europe will be held in Brussels from May 18 to 20 next year. If you’ve been making things up that these conferences are dull and boring then don’t. The ICF conference in Norway this year felt like one long party where you knew all the guests. Brussels will be a great place to add some more fertiliser to our growing walnut tree.

<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><strong>Tony Parry, CPCC</strong>, is co-organizer for the European Co-Active Coaching Community with Kyle Newman, a new front-of-room leader for CTI and a coach who specialises in writing and writers.
