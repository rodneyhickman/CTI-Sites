    </strong>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Political leadership coaching has emerged to support public leaders as they traverse the highly challenging issues during these polarizing and partisan times.  
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>The result of working with a political leadership coach is a more authentic and courageous political leader willing to boldly lead from higher ground.
</strong>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So what is political leadership coaching?
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Political coaches are not pollsters, consultants or strategists zeroing in on the next election plan. Rather, nonpartisan political coaches have a one-on-one relationship with a political candidate or elected official that equips them with the personal tools and knowledge to clarify and manifest their vision for their time in public office. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My political coaching business is strictly nonpartisan while other political coaches may choose to work with only one party or social activist group. Making this initial decision requires a careful review of the benefits and drawbacks to working within a partisan atmosphere. Because I specialize in development of leadership skills, I enjoy working across all political boundaries, emphasizing qualities of leadership rather than political positions.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A political coach can help:
  <p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><ul>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><li> 	Assess, develop and enhance the client’s personal leadership style.</li>
  <li>Develop the art of collaborative leadership. </li>
  <li> Provide tools for managing their anxiety and stress in difficult situations. 
        Like executive coaches, political coaches also work to: </li>
  <li>Create a confidential relationship that allows the politician to be fully human. </li>
  <li>Create an environment in which the politician can freely discuss concerns that are not appropriate for their consultants or staff. </li>
  <li>	Help politicians foster genuine relationships with others, including building alliances across political boundaries.</li>
  <li>	Discover new possibilities in the midst of entrenched political views.</li>
  <li>	Help politicians fully develop their vision for their political legacy, far beyond just winning their next election.</li>
  <li> Help politicians keep their vision for public service alive in the midst of struggle and defeat. </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Political coaches do not comment on their client's political opinions or espouse their own positions—quite the contrary. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The coach may be the only person who does not want something from the political leader and who, therefore, can provide honest reflective listening. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When is the right time to seek a political leadership coach? Here are just a few situations in which coaching is especially helpful:
<ul>
  <li>	When considering running for office, especially for the first time or running again following a defeat.</li>
  <li>	After winning an election in order to help set the agenda for the first few months in office.</li>
  <li>	When considering running for another office or wondering if it is time to retire.</li>
  <li>	When the demands of public and private life become imbalanced.</li>
  <li> During challenging times, when vision, purpose and passion are a blur rather than a daily source of inspiration and energy. </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Working within a highly confidential relationship is distinctive to coaching. Unlike political consultants and pollsters, who boast of their client's winning ways and often feel their future is tied to the outcome of the election, political coaches do not reveal their relationship with their political client unless the politician chooses to do so. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A political coach can help clients make sense of and integrate the various types of advice the politicians receive from others—not by proposing a solution, but by helping them sort through what they are hearing, how they feel about it and what possibilities they want to choose. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Today’s new breed of political leaders will focus on setting aside their personal fears and offering their time and resources in service of a purpose they may or may not see fulfilled during their lifetime: transforming our political system for the sake of generations to come. Political leadership coaches are an emerging and essential new profession that will accelerate the political transformation that is already underway. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you know of individuals considering running for office or re-election, please encourage them to seek out the services of a political leadership coach.
