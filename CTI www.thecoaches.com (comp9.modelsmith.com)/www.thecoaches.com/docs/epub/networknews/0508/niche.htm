	  <strong>Intuition…our Inner Guide <br></strong> 
	  
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	 Intuition. What is it, exactly (besides one of the contexts of Co-Active coaching)? It’s subtle and nebulous. Intuition functions in a quantum leap. It occurs where nothing existed before. There is no methodological procedure. There is simply knowing…from nothing.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It comes in several forms. Some people see it. Some people hear it. Others just know it or feel it somewhere in their body. It comes in thoughtlessness, not in figuring it out. It comes in love, not in fear. It’s a knowing that bubbles up from the gut, not one that pushes down from the head. It comes where there is neither judgment nor criticism. When we go to a place of love and openness, intuition spontaneously arrives. It shows up in people, animals, nature and “coincidences.” It’s always there, waiting for us to notice it.



      </em>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You might ask, “What is there to notice?” It might be in the words of a song that speaks to you, an aroma, someone or something that pops into your mind when you were not thinking anything related, two people mentioning the same book in a week, meeting someone and feeling a particular sensation somewhere in your body, or even by noticing the same image over and over again. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Is it really so easy? Yes! We can even propose some guidelines:
      <ol>
        <li>	<strong>Be open to it.</strong> Believe in it and that you possess it. We all have it. We can all hone it.      </li>
        <li> <strong>Come from a place of love.</strong> From this perspective, anything is possible AND you love your clients enough to play with your intuition in service of them.        </li>
        <li><strong>Notice it without filtering it.</strong> Speak whatever comes to you without judgment. When using your intuition with clients, remember that it isn’t about you. It’s for your client to hear and translate the meaning into their life.          </li>
        <li> <strong>Work it. </strong>Intuition is a muscle that requires exercise. Don’t become frustrated if it doesn’t land for the client; he or she may not be ready to hear it yet.          </li>
        <li><strong>Reflect on your intuitive patterns. </strong>This will help you learn to trust your intuition. You’ll begin to identify how you first notice your intuition, what you’re physically doing when you notice it and in what state of mind. It will become a reliable friend. </li>
      </ol>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Come develop a playful relationship with your intuition at the Intuition Niche teleclasses. Our Co-Active community is a learning environment in which all can develop awareness of their unique intuitive gift. Join us for our next call on September 15 at 9 a.m. Pacific time. The topic is “The Habits that Get in the Way of My Intuition.” We’ll discover the things that block us from our intuition. Fear, disbelief, the cynic or gremlin all potentially derail the intuitive process.
