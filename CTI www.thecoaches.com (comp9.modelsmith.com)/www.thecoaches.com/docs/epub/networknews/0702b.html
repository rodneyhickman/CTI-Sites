Hello Co-Activationists,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">

I’m curious. What’s the impact on you when I call you Co-Activationists?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’d like to point not to the question, but to the curious piece. It’s in being curious that I can better assume (watch out for that too!) how it will land “over there” in your email box—or how it’s read online. Do you find yourself not responding to discussions because you make up that it’s not important or that what you have to share just won’t have that “splash” like others seem to? I smell a saboteur. Or, do you simply follow an urge to post, wanting to be seen and heard without really looking at the bigger picture? Are you ever curious how your contribution is received? I assert most of you are, and keep looking.

     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The word safari in Kiswahili means to go on a journey or expedition. My recent safari to East Africa in December 2006, was a series of miracles along the way. Never did I dream that my coaching and leadership education I completed five years ago, would lead me to the first rural Grassroots African Women’s Conference in Bondo, Kenya. My journey to East Africa was to give back to young women some of the gifts that I had been given.

This is a person who may have a rarely viewed email address and has, at best, a planning horizon of two hours. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is 30% likely that the client is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol and/or gambling or is in recovery from an addiction. It is also 30% possible that the client has been diagnosed with some form of mental disorder; commonly depression or bipolar disorder, occasionally ADD/ADHD or even schizophrenia. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As to the question of jail time, it is likely. Some abuse? Probably. On the plus side, it is 30% likely that the client is a graduate of at least a degree level education and 55% likely that the person works for a living. On the other hand, add that this person probably lives in a shared space, with others in a similar situation and has no personal space outside of his or her bed. It is even possible this person shares one room with 200 others and sleeps on a washable, plastic-covered foam mat each night.

by Suzanne Ness
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="0702/musing-sm.jpg" width="119" height="133" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">A few weeks ago, my 5-year-old was given a caterpillar at her preschool, along with instructions on how to care for the caterpillar. This was not unusual. Chloe, my 5-year-old, is fascinated with bugs of all kinds. She has brought home many creepy crawlies in different containers, hoping to raise them to adulthood and keep them as pets. She always willingly releases them when I explain that they will die in the container she caught them in. She has a regard for life that outweighs her desire to have bugs as pets.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We watched the caterpillar eat and move for a week. The instructions told us that it would shed five times as it grew, before it became a chrysalis. At that time, it would attach itself upside down to the lid of the container and remain that way for 7-10 days as it morphed into a butterfly. I, too, was curious, as I have never witnessed this phenomenon up close before. I also did not know what to expect.

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Double posting is one of those “ta da’s” created by the poster of a discussion. If you’ve crafted a discussion and sent it, then gone back because you noticed an error, corrected it and then resent it again (are you still following me?)…then a double post has been created. We’re all going to get it twice. That is, the members who have their “real time” notification set for that community. Those that are on “digest” mode won’t. Good luck!      
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Secondly, I’ve noticed a few “cheerleading” emails coming across the boards. Don’t get me wrong, I love celebrating and cheering people on. However, did you know that sometimes on the Main Community when you “reply all” from the links at the bottom of the discussion, your “Yay! You go and let us know!” email has hit more than 8,600 email in-boxes? Is that the impact you want to have? I make up that there’s a level of excitement and wanting to contribute that happens faster than taking a breath and getting curious as to what you want to say. My editorial in this issue addresses this. My request is to slow down and think about where your contribution(s) will end up. If you need help, contact me at <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a>.

    <p>Dear V. B., <br>
      I couldn&rsquo;t help but immediately  notice the way you phrased the first sentence of your question. &ldquo;I have a  client <b><i>who makes it very hard for me</i></b>to intrude and take  charge.&rdquo; Notice the difference between your perspective and this perspective:  &ldquo;I have a hard time intruding and taking charge with one of my clients.&rdquo; Or  possibly even this perspective: &ldquo;I do not like to interrupt clients (or anyone  for that matter) because I believe that it is rude and impolite.&rdquo; In your  version, you have given your power to the client rather than owning your part  of the Co-Active coaching relationship. Do you see the difference between your  statement and taking responsibility for your choice to not interrupt her?

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Client’s agenda. But is there more to it than just that? How is it effective? When is it not? How do we do it? What makes it important? What's hard about it? What's easy?
And much, much more worth exploring.
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for your training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome. We'll be learning from each other. Everyone is encouraged to participate and share perspectives and experience.

We are going to host a Pole Dancing evening with a juicy debrief afterwards. What secret self showed up? What myth about yourself was shattered or strengthened? What aspects of this experience are signaling you to unfold it more in your relationship? All body types and ages welcome—wear something comfortable and don’t let your saboteur talk you out of it! Wear something comfortable.
