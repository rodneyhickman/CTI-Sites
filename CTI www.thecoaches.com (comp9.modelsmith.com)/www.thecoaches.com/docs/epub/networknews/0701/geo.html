  	      <p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"> by Aysegul Yilmaz, life coach
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Another year has ended! I am sure you are hearing this  sentence a lot these days. As many of us do at this time every year, I start to  review the previous year&rsquo;s balance sheet and start questioning myself. What did  I do? What didn&rsquo;t I do? Why didn&rsquo;t I do it? If I really wanted to, what would I  do? Start making new resolutions for the coming year. </p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Since the beginning of December, I am in this mood. But this  year, I have a different interest for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions because I think it  is a good way to start a coaching relationship as well. Therefore, I decided to  do a little search; I wrote &ldquo;new year resolutions&rdquo; in the Google search box and  was amazed by the result. This topic is extremely popular! Another surprising  discovery for me are the New Year&rsquo;s resolutions made all around the world that  are very similar:</p>
	      <ol start="1" type="1">
            <li>Lose       weight and get in better physical shape.</li>
	        <li>Stick       to a budget.</li>
	        <li>Reduce       debt.</li>
	        <li>Enjoy       more quality time with family and friends.</li>
	        <li>Find       soul mate.</li>
	        <li>Quit       smoking.</li>
	        <li>Find       better work.</li>
	        <li>Learn       something new.</li>
	        <li>Volunteer       and help others.</li>
	        <li>Get       organized.</li>
      </ol>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Did you find anything familiar?</p>
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is good to define targets for the New Year. Making a  decision for a new start and thinking of improving life quality is a good  feeling and brings excitement to our life. To achieve a resolution, focus,  accountability, persistence and personal integrity are required. Focusing on  each goal separately, having a plan, having support from a friend/mentor/life  coach, being persistent and determined&mdash;all will increase the level of success. </p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We all make New Year's resolutions, but how many of us are  keeping them? In their article &ldquo;If at First You Don&rsquo;t Succeed,&rdquo; Polivy and  Herman cite statistics that: </p>
	      <ul type="disc">
            <li>A full 25% of New Year&rsquo;s       resolutions will be abandoned in the first 15 weeks. </li>
	        <li>The average number of New       Year&rsquo;s resolutions made is 10. </li>
	        <li>Those who manage to make a       resolution that lasts for six months or more have often tried five or six       times before finally succeeding. </li>
	        <li>Many New Year&rsquo;s resolutions       are for health-related goals.</li>
      </ul>
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This  year, what would you do differently to make your resolutions work? You may  start working on a plan. To have a goal without a plan will not take you  anywhere. With a plan you can define what to do next and what other steps you  need to complete to reach your goal. 
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  If  you don&rsquo;t want to forget your resolutions by the end of February, you had  better start planning now! Writing down the resolutions and reviewing them from  time to time will show how committed you are.  
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  Let  me remind you that flexibility (dancing in the moment!) is also very important  while making resolutions. These are <i>your</i> resolutions and you have right to change or revise them along the way. And as  long as your resolutions/goals/targets&mdash;however you want to call it&mdash;overlap with  your values, the success rate will definitely increase. 
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  When  I started researching and writing this article, I was thinking of finding  different ways to start a coaching relationship in 2007. But then I realized  that, while working with our clients, we coaches tend to forget ourselves. We  help them identify their values, potential, goals, life purpose and so many  other things, but are we also doing this valuable work for ourself? Don&rsquo;t you  think that we deserve it?
