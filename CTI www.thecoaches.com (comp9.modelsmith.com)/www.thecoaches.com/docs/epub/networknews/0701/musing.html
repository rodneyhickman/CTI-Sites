	        by Rikki Fowler, CPCC, PCC
	      	        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>Discover the deliciousness of silence. Allow silence after a  client speaks and listen to what emerges into the silence. During a telephone  call, let the silence increase and be amazed at the wisdom that surfaces. In a  workshop, provide silence after those provocative questions. What do you do  with silence?</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>Did you take some time to think about the question? Or did  you say, I&rsquo;m too busy?</p>
	      <p>What is silence? It&rsquo;s the absence of sound; a time when we  hear something, like the breeze or a coyote howl, that makes us aware of the  silence around us; a quiet mind that allows you to be aware of the external  silence; and the internal stillness from which another voice, not your own,  speaks.</p>
	      <p>Here are some things you can do with silence:</p>
	      <p>Turn off the radio, TV, iPod. Shut the door and do whatever  you need to find silence. Become friends with silence. Sit with it, like you  sit with an idea. Let it sink into your pores to wash the hustle and bustle of  the day away.</p>
	      <p><b>Appreciate silence.</b> One of the best feelings is sitting with a good friend in silence, with a  connected, companionable energy between you. This is a sacred moment, when it  seems as though Spirit is present. </p>
	      <p>Listen to the crunch of snow, waves on the beach, birds  singing. Watching birds is how I first came to appreciate silence; it&rsquo;s hard to  hear them sing when you&rsquo;re in a conversation with another birder.</p>
	      <p><b>Be with silence.</b> Luxuriate in it, drink it in, enjoy the peace and quiet. Sit with it longer and  listen for what comes into your mind. Is it the voice of busyness, or does the  still, small voice know that you are available to hear its wisdom?</p>
	      <p><b>Listen to silence. </b><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EE</p>
	      <p>What did you hear? Within silence, you can be completely  with your Self. We all crave silence at times, to hear the voice within and let  intentions or dreams rise to consciousness. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been carrying a note  pad to write down ideas before they disappear. They&rsquo;re like jumping fish, now  you see it, oops it&rsquo;s gone. They&rsquo;re shy and wonder if you&rsquo;ll be open to them,  ready to nurture them this time. </p>
	      <p>It&rsquo;s when Spirit is most likely to speak, those short  moments of silence: in the shower, when you&rsquo;re driving, taking a walk, or just  going about your day. Bingo there&rsquo;s that voice of inspiration. Catch it before  it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
	      <p><b>Ignore silence.</b> We all do. But at a cost; you don&rsquo;t learn to listen to silence. As your mind  learns to be quiet, the nervous system gets a chance to rest and you are able  to receive important messages from your inner guide.&nbsp; </p>
	      <p>When you can listen to silence, you will discover the  incredible riches that exist within you and capture the magic that happens in  silence. The silence doesn&rsquo;t have to be very long, a minute can feel like an  eternity or 15 minutes can go by in a flash.</p>
	      <p><b>Go deeply into  silence.</b> Sink into its vastness. Let silence roam around, discovering a  hidden limiting belief or an innovative idea that had been forming, ready to  appear. The voice of your Future Self may speak to you. Allow silence to  divulge the secrets of your heart&rsquo;s desire. </p>
	      <p><b>Make silence work for  you.</b> When you&rsquo;re listening, listen in silence. Be in the moment; hear what  the other person is saying, without running commentary or planning your  rebuttal or response, in your head. Let the next question or thought arise from  the silence naturally. </p>
	      <p>It can be a huge revelation to discover that you don&rsquo;t have  to rehearse what you are going to say ahead of time. It&rsquo;s possible to make your  response to what someone has said <i>after</i> you&rsquo;ve heard what they said. You can trust your mind to find the words, as they  are needed. </p>
	      <p>Now when you speak, you don&rsquo;t know what will come out of  your mouth. Consciousness can speak through you. And the other person feels  really heard.</p>
	      <p>When I&rsquo;m coaching, I find that I listen more and speak less.  Clients&rsquo; heads are filled with questions, unreflected thoughts and information  that need a container in which to turn into wisdom. Clients need a space where  they can: bring their ideas, look through their thoughts, see what to keep and  what to let go of, discover what ideas go with other ideas, or decide if there  are inconsistencies. </p>
	      <p>Coaches can offer such a container (silence) where this  sorting can take place, if we&rsquo;re not busily thinking about the next question to  ask. If a question is needed, it usually pops into your mind.</p>
	      <p>Silence works like a vacuum, it invites people to open up  and say the most amazing things they hadn&rsquo;t intended to say. Silence can also  pull out the rest of an idea or attract the unspoken thought that&rsquo;s ready to be  said.</p>
	      <p><b>Hear silence&rsquo;s call.</b> Something might not seem quite right to you, you&rsquo;re just off your game. Silence  is calling you to take some time to sit with yourself. Get out your journal and  listen in the silence for what wants to be heard.</p>
	      <p>This morning, I knew there was more to put into this  article, so I took a short walk. Movement is one way that I access the wisdom  in my body. As I walked, I let my mind idle and sure enough, additional ideas  came to mind. </p>
	      <p><b>Cultivate silence.</b> Some people turn off the radio in the car, and work and/or exercise in silence.  Others meditate or are conscious of listening deeply, staying in the present  moment, as they go through their day. From silence, you will harvest peace,  wonder, joy, creativity, wisdom and a wealth that comes in no other way.&nbsp; </p>
	      <p>What delights will you find in silence? I look forward to  hearing about your experiences. Silence is an undervalued skill; partner with  it more often.</p>
