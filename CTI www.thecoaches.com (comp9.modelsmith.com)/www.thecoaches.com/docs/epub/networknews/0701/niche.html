	  	   <p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"> by Alida Schuyler, Haskell Hestand, Theresa Swift
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Addiction costs Americans more than $100 billion a year in  lost productivity, social disorder and excessive use of healthcare services.  This affects everyone: health insurers and public health agencies see  disproportionate use of emergency rooms, general medical and psychiatric  services; employers pay for substance abuse treatment and need their employees  to return to full functioning; and the criminal justice system wants less crime,  incarceration and parole violations.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At home, families want to live without the worries,  embarrassment, violence and financial concerns that go hand-in-hand with  substance abuse. And addicts themselves have needs and wants. They want relief  from discomfort caused by the direct effects of substance abuse, as well as  improved personal and social functioning, resulting in fewer problems. Everyone  wants the costs of addiction to come down, especially the cost of repeated  treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of addicts relapse soon after treatment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Recovery Coaching Enhances  Quality of Life and Prevents Relapse&nbsp; </b><br>
	    Recovery coaching is highly effective support when the  addict comes home from treatment. Recovery coaching reduces stress by helping  the addict and family build awareness and focus on true values and strengths.  Co-Active coaching forwards the action with purpose and direction, and the  addict addresses his or her problems quickly and effectively. Recovery coaching  helps the family and addict get connected with 12-step or other local community  support. As a result, stress does not build up, quality of life improves and vulnerability  to relapse decreases. Here are illustrations of recovery coaching at work  within the recovery community:</p>

	    I cured a three-year cocaine addiction with a seven-year  methamphetamine addiction, for which I then substituted a 120-pound weight gain.  The disease of addiction manifested itself in many ways. I remember how lost I  felt as I drifted over the years from treatment to therapy, to Narcotics  Anonymous, to Overeaters Anonymous and finally to Alcoholics Anonymous. While I  diligently worked the 12 steps in each program, I stopped using, drinking and  compulsively overeating, but never seemed to move beyond program into the new  life that I wanted. I began to think that my Higher Power had created me just  to &ldquo;recover,&rdquo; over and over again. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Finally, with the guidance of a Co-Active coach, I&rsquo;ve been  able to move beyond thinking of myself only as a drug and food addict and into  the wonderful life that was waiting for me on the other side! I see now that it  wasn&rsquo;t enough to surrender to my addictive substances. I needed to move beyond  my past and grow toward my Future Self. And Co-Active coaching has enabled me  to do just that. </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>Sheryl</i><br>
	    I started drinking at the age of 11&mdash;from wine to whisky&mdash;and  drank and drugged straight until I stopped by the grace of AA when I was 29. When I had 14 years of 12-step recovery (I  now have 23 years), I came across coaching and hired a Co-Active coach. At  that time, I was underearning and underemployed. I thought of myself primarily  in terms of being an alcoholic. I lived one day at a time. My coach asked me to  drop the story about being a drunk. She challenged me to quit focusing on my  past and my limitations. My coach asked me what I wanted and how was I going to  get it. She taught me to set goals and plan ahead. I quickly saw my life blossom because of coaching. I loved being held  creative, resourceful and whole. I learned to plan my life and apply &ldquo;one day  at a time&rdquo; to drinking rather than to my whole life. </p>

	    I often wonder whether I&rsquo;d have relapsed all those times if  my early recovery had been supported by coaching. With the strength-based recovery  coaching model, I would have been encouraged to explore relapse prevention  techniques, physical health restoration, career resurrection and relationship  growth&hellip;to construct and establish a new lifestyle that wasn&rsquo;t dependent on alcohol  and other drugs. A recovery coach had the potential to complement the work of  counselors and sponsors, and to re-engage me with my life and the direction in  which I wanted it to grow.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ironically, I became an addiction counselor prior to  becoming a coach. I worked with patients as they moved toward discharge from  our treatment center, and I saw most of them flounder in early recovery and  many of them readmit into treatment. Now, as a recovery coach, I&rsquo;m able to  contribute to a significant reduction in relapse, and help those in recovery  move beyond self-identification as addicted individuals, into a new life of  growth and joy!	</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>Kayla</i><br>
	    After a long recovery road, I found coaching and recognized  it as the career I had long been searching for. I loved coaching from the  get-go. I loved it because it was a fun way to help people. I could bring  everything I knew, my whole self to it. I could coach clients about their  beliefs and values, or their business and money habits. By coaching and being  coached, I was growing faster than the people in my home group. I began to want  alcoholics and other addicts to know about coaching. I decided to devote my  life to growing recovery coaching into an estimable profession with a solid  philosophical base&mdash;to reflect the best of coaching and chemical dependency. </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>How Can <i>You </i>Play?&nbsp; </b><br>
	    Niche marketing will evolve within recovery coaching along  several predictable lines, including: a) <b>type of addiction</b>, such as overeating  or undereating, nicotine addiction or Internet porn addiction; b) preferred <b>method  of recovery,</b> e.g. Christian-based recovery coaching, alternatives to  12-step, harm reduction, etc.; c) expertise in <b>common issues in recovery</b>, such as relapse, co-dependency,  dating and romantic relationships in recovery, financial recovery; d) coaching  that is adapted to meet the specific needs of a particular <b>ethnic or  cultural</b> group, such as Native Americans or Asians; e) coaching a  particular <b>stage of recovery</b>,  such as early recovery, relapse or long-term recovery. </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Clearly, there are many ways to play in the &ldquo;recovery  sandbox!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s room for all to create and pioneer their own, unique recovery  coaching career. </p>
