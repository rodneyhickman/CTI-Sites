  &ldquo;Amazing grace&hellip;how sweet the sound&rdquo;<br>
  by Pawe&#322; Sopkowski</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At the start, let us thank all the contributors of the  first year of CTI Polska. Special thanks to Lori Shook, for her energy, real  commitment and concern; all the leaders, for their openness for new, special  Polish culture; the CTI partners, for welcoming us warmly and supporting on our  way; and clients, for deciding to trust us. There are many more people that we  are grateful to and not enough space to list all the names.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">One more special thank you to Kasia, our office  manager, for all her hard work, persistence and passion. Thank you, Kasia.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This was a wonderful year (well, we know it is not a  full year, so what?). We have run nine courses up until now. The first group of  20 people has finished the whole program. It was like a miracle, a privilege, a  grace to be able to see all the students experiencing the strength coming out  of the Co-Active way of creating and maintaining relationships&mdash;the  relationships full of acceptance, respect, sincere interest, concern, and  servant-minded.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Every time we run a course it feels like an &ldquo;amazing  grace.&rdquo; Poland and Polish people have suffered a lot in the last 250 years of  history: wars, Nazi occupation, Communism. At the courses, we can feel it.  There is such a level of pain, suffering and fear. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At the same time, people help each other, coach each  other, respect each other, accept and trust each other in an amazing way. The  students have overcome their limitations, dared to dream, dared to be themselves.  It is such a privilege to witness the butterflies coming out of their cocoons.  Wonderful. Amazing. Beautiful. People.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Thank God for this opportunity. Thank you all for all  the heart and support. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We feel better and bigger things are on the way.</p>
