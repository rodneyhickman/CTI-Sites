	  by Bliss Carman (1861-1929)<br>
	  <br>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> I HEARD  the spring wind whisper <br>
	  Above the brushwood fire, <br>
  &quot;The world is made forever <br>
	  Of transport and desire. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I am the breath of being, <br>
	  The primal urge of things; <br>
	  I am the whirl of star dust, <br>
	  I am the lift of wings. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I am the splendid impulse <br>
	  That comes before the thought, <br>
	  The joy and exaltation <br>
	  Wherein the life is caught. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;Across the sleeping furrows <br>
	  I call the buried seed, <br>
	  And blade and bud and blossom <br>
	  Awaken at my need. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;Within the dying ashes <br>
	  I blow the sacred spark, <br>
	  And make the hearts of lovers <br>
	  To leap against the dark.&quot; <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <b>II</b><br>
  &nbsp; <br>
	  I heard the spring light whisper <br>
	  Above the dancing stream, <br>
  &quot;The world is made forever <br>
	  In likeness of a dream. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I am the law of planets, <br>
	  I am the guide of man; <br>
	  The evening and the morning <br>
	  Are fashioned to my plan. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I tint the dawn with crimson, <br>
	  I tinge the sea with blue; <br>
	  My track is in the desert, <br>
	  My trail is in the dew. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I paint the hills with color, <br>
	  And in my magic dome <br>
	  I light the star of evening <br>
	  To steer the traveler home. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;Within the house of being, <br>
	  I feed the lamp of truth <br>
	  With tales of ancient wisdom <br>
	  And prophecies of youth.&quot; <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <b>III</b><br>
  &nbsp; <br>
	  I heard the spring rain murmur <br>
	  Above the roadside flower, <br>
  &quot;The world is made forever <br>
	  In melody and power. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I keep the rhythmic measure <br>
	  That marks the steps of time, <br>
	  And all my toil is fashioned <br>
	  To symmetry and rhyme. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I plow the untilled upland, <br>
	  I ripe the seeding grass, <br>
	  And fill the leafy forest <br>
	  With music as I pass. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I hew the raw, rough granite <br>
	  To loveliness of line, <br>
	  And when my work is finished, <br>
	  Behold, it is divine! <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  &quot;I am the master-builder <br>
	  In whom the ages trust. <br>
	  I lift the lost perfection <br>
	  To blossom from the dust.&quot; <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <b>IV</b><br>
  &nbsp; <br>
	  Then Earth to them made answer, <br>
	  As with a slow refrain <br>
	  Born of the blended voices <br>
	  Of wind and sun and rain, <br>
  &quot;This is the law of being <br>
	  That links the threefold chain: <br>
	  The life we give to beauty </p>
	  Returns to us again.&quot;<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
