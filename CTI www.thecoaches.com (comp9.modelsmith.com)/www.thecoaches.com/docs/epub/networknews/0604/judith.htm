      <p><i>I am a new coach and I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by all of my clients. I think about them a lot during the week. I can&rsquo;t stop wondering about them and what is happening for them during the time between our coaching sessions. Is this typical? More importantly, how does one stop thinking about one&rsquo;s clients all the time? </i><br>
          <i>&mdash;S.T. </i></p>
      <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">Dear S.T.: <br>
        This seems to be a typical phase that many new coaches go through when they start their coaching practices. On one hand, it is a good sign that you care about your clients and are committed to doing a good job. On the other hand, these concerned thoughts may be sourced by your saboteurs and, thus, need to be managed. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My first suggestion is to firmly stand on the cornerstone  that your clients are naturally creative, resourceful and whole. Usually our  concern is coming from some fear that we may have hurt our clients or that we  will damage them in some way because we are beginners at coaching. The first  step to take is to pay attention to your clients. Are they acting differently  since you spoke to them last? Perhaps you did hurt their feelings. Encourage  them to talk about how they feel. If they can&rsquo;t talk to you about it, it is  likely that this is an issue that arises elsewhere in their lives. Have them look  at the cost that they are paying by not letting you know how they really feel  so that you can work it out together. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Most likely, you are feeling more sensitive about your work  than they are. Ask yourself what is it that has you constantly thinking about  your clients? It is easy for the Saboteur to continuously fuel delusions about  the need to be perfect, rather than appreciating the value of each coaching  encounter being a possibility for both you and your client to learn more about  yourselves and each other. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Because you are also naturally creative, resourceful and  whole, when you are truly worried that you may have done something hurtful, it  is a good idea to either call one of your supervisors if you are in a  Certification program or hire a supervisor with whom you can discuss the issue.  Our mistakes are our best teachers. Discussing both our mistakes and our  successes with a more experienced coach can provide perspective and deepen our  learning in ways that we may not anticipate. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As you become more comfortable with your role as a  professional coach, you will learn to be fully present with your clients when  you are with them and unattached when you are not with them. This doesn&rsquo;t mean  that you don&rsquo;t care about them or even that you don&rsquo;t think of them at all, but  it does mean that you are not grasping at the coaching relationship as if you  need it more than your clients do. Most clients are coming to you for support  and direction. They are not coming to you because you have some omnipotent  power that will either solve all of their problems for them or at the other  extreme that will damage them for life. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I periodically think about each of my clients during the  week. I think, &ldquo;Oh, this book that I&rsquo;m reading right now will be really helpful  for Client X,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Client Y is giving a big presentation today. I&rsquo;m going to  send her some supportive energy.&rdquo; Sometimes I think about my clients because I  am going through something similar and I think about the coincidence or  synchronicity of our experiences. Occasionally, I will be preoccupied after a  session when one of my clients is going through a hard time. I currently have a  client who is dealing with a very upsetting event. I am managing my own anxiety  about this situation so that I can be fully present when I am coaching him. It  will do him no good if I am just as upset as he is. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At some point, after working with enough clients, you will  notice that your propensity for putting so much time into thinking about your  clients will lessen. This is not because you care any less but because you are  becoming more secure in and knowledgeable about coaching. As you learn to trust  yourself, you will also learn to trust your clients. Coaching, like any  learning experience, is a developmental process that takes place over time.  Allow yourself the time to grow and the time to learn. It&rsquo;s always easiest to  do this in the company of another more experienced guide. Don&rsquo;t forget to use  your coach and qualified supervisors to get through this developmental period. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Finally, the most important answer to your question is to  create a big and fulfilled life of your own. If your own life is satisfying,  nurturing and exciting to you, you won&rsquo;t need to obsess about your clients&rsquo;  lives. I always like to ask people when they have frequently recurring thoughts  that are not helpful to them, &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t spending time thinking about  _____ (fill in the blank), then what else would you be doing?&rdquo; 
      <p style="margin: 30 0 0 0"><i>One of my  readers appropriately sent me feedback on my response to R.E. last month in  regard to working with retired people. He pointed out that my response to R.E.  was far more abstract than my response to P.K. who was dealing with the issue  of managing shame. The reader correctly deduced that I have not yet experienced  retirement, while I have far more than a passing familiarity with the  experience of shame. His point, which I can agree with, is that certain  situations can benefit from having a coach who is knowledgeable about that  experience. </i>
      <p style="margin: 30 0 0 0">A case in point is that about 15 years ago, I worked with a  client who was a cancer survivor. I was appropriately empathic, asked powerful  questions and I referred her to experts who could answer some of her questions.  She and I both agreed that our work together was successful. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Seven years later, I, myself, was diagnosed with cancer.  Many times during my own treatment and in its aftermath I thought about my work  with my client years before. While I understood intellectually what she was  going through at the time, now being in a similar, if not worse situation,  opened my eyes to areas I never even noticed before and that she didn&rsquo;t  mention. Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t talk about these things because she assumed that  since I didn&rsquo;t bring them up, I couldn&rsquo;t relate to them. Or maybe she had yet  to experience these thoughts and feelings. I don&rsquo;t know. What I do know is that  it is very different to coach someone from an observer&rsquo;s stance rather than a  survivor&rsquo;s stance. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While I am not recommending that you go out and get cancer  in order to work with cancer patients and survivors, I do suggest that you  familiarize yourself as much as possible with the feelings, themes, trends,  obstacles and successes that relate to the topic at hand. Most importantly,  talk to people in that situation. Not only will they probably be happy to tell  you things that you could never learn elsewhere, but also you will be giving  them an opportunity to share their learning. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There is a caveat that accompanies having had personal  experience in a specific field. Not everyone has the same experience as you  have or had. Your clients may see things from a very different point of view.  Curiosity is especially important in these situations. It is easy to make  incorrect assumptions because we have been there and &ldquo;know what the experience  is like.&rdquo; I am always happy that I have chosen not to speak of my experience  prior to hearing my clients&rsquo; experiences of similar events in our lives. They  often take things in a very different direction than I could have imagined.  This difference inspires me to be even more creative in terms of calling them  forth and supporting them in their goals. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There is always more to learn as a coach. I thank my reader  for bringing the &ldquo;peer&rdquo; perspective into the conversation. If you have a niche  in which you want to operate, such as retirement, be prepared to be as  knowledgeable about it as you can be. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced retirement  yet, speak to those who have and to those who spend time with people who have  retired. Not only will you be better able to help your own current clients, but  it will prepare you to better plan for your own retirement experience should  that be something you choose to do in the future.
