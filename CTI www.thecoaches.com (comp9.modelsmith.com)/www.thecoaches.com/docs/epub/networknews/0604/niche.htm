      <p><b>Co-Active Coaching for Health/Vitality/Wellness</b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0604/Niche.jpg" alt="Pat Barone, CPCC, PCC, www.patbarone.com" width="100" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">I often get puzzled looks when I tell people I am a  professional life coach who works in the area of weight loss. &ldquo;What does life  coaching have to do with a diet?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m asked.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And I love it when they ask that question! After all, they  are being curious and I&rsquo;ve got lots to tell them about the topic. I love the  opportunity to educate people about a tool that goes way beyond the limited  scope of a diet.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">        Here&rsquo;s what I know: If we adopt a diet or an exercise plan,  it works temporarily, while we are following it. Once adherence (as the fitness  community is fond of calling it) waivers, the weight comes back, as if it&rsquo;s  been on a little hike and is coming home to rest. If we change deeper attitudes  about food (and ourselves and even life!), permanent change occurs. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all about in the Health/Vitality/Wellness  niche community. The beauty of deep and lasting change that all life coaches  experience with their clients marries a focus area of extreme importance: the  client&rsquo;s health, fitness, vitality and the quality of their future life.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a &ldquo;loser&rdquo; who has lost more than 70 pounds permanently  (defined as more than five years), I know my own personal change could not have  happened without the deeper emotional, mental and spiritual growth that I  accomplished while losing weight. I wish I had had a coach back then!</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">But, the small city where I live in the U.S. Midwest (Madison,   WI), tends to be behind the coasts in terms  of information and trends, and there weren't many coaches here 10 years ago  when I began my quest for fitness.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Luckily, my clients across the country now have the distinct  advantage a coach brings to their lives.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Using Co-Active skills to coach clients towards greater  health, fitness and vitality is thrilling for those of us who work in this  area. The organic nature of coaching addresses the entire human being. The  result is deep and enduring change. The accelerated growth that occurs is as  exciting for the client as it is for the coach.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In some ways, we might feel we work backwards from the  Co-Active model. Small &ldquo;a&rdquo; appears first and can seem overwhelming for many  clients. Many of them cling desperately to their little &ldquo;a&rdquo;s of losing 50 lbs.,  competing in a triathalon, or improving a health condition. The urgency they  may feel over an illness or a medical condition can accentuate this  desperation.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This is where creating a safe place for the client is so  important. Often, the feelings that come up are ones they have never expressed  or acknowledged before. Trusting me is one of the many gifts my clients give me  every day.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The accountability tools for weight and fitness, like food  and exercise logs, can reinforce the attachment to little &ldquo;a&rdquo; even further.  But, believe me, Big &ldquo;A&rdquo; is always there, describing the road ahead, beckoning  us to a greater, more magnificent way of being.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Clients quickly learn it&rsquo;s a focus issue: if you focus on  food, you get more food. If you focus on how much you hate exercise, you get  more hate. If you focus on personal values and growth, limiting beliefs are  smashed and lives are redesigned while bodies are re-sculpted.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Many of my clients double their salaries, find work they  love, and develop romantic partnerships&hellip;all the wonderful life changing things  that happen to each of your clients happen in health and fitness coaching, too.  Losing weight or getting fit becomes a part of the picture, not the only focus.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The coach&rsquo;s attachment to outcome is another Co-Active  principal that can become sticky with health and fitness coaching. My  experience as a seasoned weight loss coach and my own experience losing weight  may inform me and suggest a course of action. However, I&rsquo;ve always found that  trusting the client&rsquo;s resourcefulness is the most valuable tenet of Co-Activity  in these cases. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ll be thinking in small  increments (like adding fruit and vegetables to the daily eating plan) and the  client will blow me away with a really big step like giving up sugar. Wow! In  those cases, it&rsquo;s easy for me to look back and see how I could have held my  client small if I didn&rsquo;t have the Co-Active model working for me.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So, if you&rsquo;ve ever had a client, friend or family member who  needs an expert coach in health and fitness, our community is full of talented,  dedicated coaches. And, if you&rsquo;ve considered the niche for yourself, I&rsquo;d like  to personally invite you to join us to learn more about this exciting coaching  community! </p>
