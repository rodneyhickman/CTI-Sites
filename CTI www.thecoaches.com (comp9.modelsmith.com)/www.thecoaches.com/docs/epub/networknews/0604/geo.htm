  <p><b>The Atlantic Shrinks: Co-Activity Spreads in Europe</b> </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="0604/Geo.jpg" alt="Tony Parry, tony@coachwords.com +44-1372-801331" width="86" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" class="border1">The Atlantic is shrinking fast and may soon evaporate. It feels as if, soon, we&rsquo;ll be able to just step over it. We old Europeans, and I&rsquo;m talking about ancient cultures rather than ancient coaches, have sometimes felt a little isolated. After all, coaching was &ldquo;invented&rdquo; in America and we&rsquo;re a decade behind the times. As recently as a couple of years ago, there were doubts that we might ever be able to stand on our own two feet and contribute fully to the great international community of Co-Activity. Not any more. Things are happening quickly. Our sapling continues to shoot upwards and spread its roots.
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The number of countries holding Co-Active coaching courses grows almost by the month. The leadership programme is safely transplanted across the pond. And we&rsquo;re holding our sixth European Co-Active Coaches community day in May&mdash;to which you&rsquo;re all invited.
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">First things first—the number of courses. After all, that’s where most of us got our first taste of Co-Activity and that’s the way Co-Activity spreads fastest. The UK, Norway, Denmark and Sweden have well-established programmes. Those countries have recently been joined by Spain, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany. If we use the criterion of countries that sing in the glorious Eurovision song contest, then we can also claim Israel’s Co-Active courses as part of European expansion. But that would still leave out the United Arab Emirates, where a recent weekend of courses attracted participants from more than 20 different countries. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Europe is also rapidly growing its own body of front-of-room leaders. In 2005, we added 10 European-based leaders to the sole European representative we had before then. That’s not to forget, of course, the American and Canadian pioneer leaders who have braved the Atlantic crossing to teach us, and those among them who have taken up European residency and adopted  our strange European food and even stranger plumbing. The European leader body has now expanded once again, with the addition of four Norwegian leaders. Some of us dream of the day when there will be as many courses held in other languages as there are in English—and perhaps a lot more.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That process will be helped by the arrival of the leadership programme across the pond. The first European leadership tribe—the Swans—held their first retreat near Barcelona, Spain, in October last year. The second European leadership tribe starts its journey together in May and a third programme starts later in the year. How soon will it be before we have more leadership programmes in Europe than we have in America? Previous European graduates of leadership, who had to commute across the Atlantic four times to take the programme, now also have their own regional branch of the CALL leadership community.



 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It sometimes feels as if we are growing so quickly that only national communities will serve to keep us connected. But there’s still confidence that we can keep a European identity, too. To that end, we’re holding our sixth European Co-Active Coaches community day on Friday May 12, with the added bonus that Karen Kimsey-House has kindly offered to present one of the workshops. She will be co-leading with Kyle Newman, one of the co-leaders of this community, forming a powerful Anglo-American Co-Active Alliance. If you’ve been to a community day before, you know how much fun and connection happens on the day. If you’re still a community-day virgin, then come and see what makes everyone smile. Details of the time and place and programme are posted on the European Co-Active Community page of the Co-Active Network. Yes, I realise that once again it’s in London, because membership numbers and cheap flights still make the UK first choice. But how long before we’re holding community days in Ljubljana or Krakow? Not long we hope.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Oh… and by the way, those strange European languages are beginning to creep into CTI-speak. We no longer get strange looks when we talk about sandpits and seesaws, rather than sandboxes and teeter-totters, and when we pronounce schedule with a shhh and say we’ll have a nice cup of tea at ten to four. Now all we need to do is to know the word for teeter-totter in Polish and Hebrew, Swedish, Dutch and a few other languages. Not forgetting Cornish and Welsh.
