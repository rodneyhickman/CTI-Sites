Do a few Sun Salutations? Cordon yourself off from the kids and the dog? Make a nice cuppa tea? Sit in a special &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; chair? Or merely note the time, run to the phone and wing it?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a new coach, I have gone the gamut on my rituals for coaching. Sometimes, I sit at my desk until two minutes before the client is to call, madly checking e-mails and feverishly surfing my yahoo. Or I&rsquo;ve taken the thoughtful approach: light a nice, smelly candle, spend 15 minutes reviewing the client&rsquo;s notes and homework assignments, and make a rough plan of the things I want to remember to cover (a.k.a. remind of late payment!). I&rsquo;ve coached from my office, with the window overlooking tall trees, or from the leisure of the living room couch, or even sitting cross-legged on my bed, propped up with many pillows. I&rsquo;ve been in my PJs, or full-on &ldquo;hard clothes&rdquo; and shoes. I&rsquo;ve taken calls back-to-back or splat in the middle of a day of nothing going on.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that really no matter  what I do before the coaching, where I coach from, or how I prepare, what  really counts is who I am being <i>during</i> the coaching. As soon as the coaching call starts, I must turn all my focus  Over There&hellip;and that&rsquo;s what makes the coaching work. I can tell if I haven&rsquo;t  shut down my own racing mind. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As coaches, we need to do whatever it takes  to get to that grounded place, for the sake of the human on the other end of  the line who pays us to be 100% there. It is a skill that I find takes practice  and patience with myself. I can try to self-manage till the cows come home, but  if I haven&rsquo;t really gotten quiet in my mind, I&rsquo;ll be fighting silently for the  whole call. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So rituals may help&hellip;do what makes sense to  loosen your grip and open the space in your head and your heart. Dance, open  the windows, listen to your favourite song of the summer, review your notes,  stand on your head, take off (or put on!) your PJs, and be your whole, present  self when you say, &ldquo;Hello client!&rdquo;
