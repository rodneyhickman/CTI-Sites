	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The spaciousness that one would assume would be created in the summer months has decided to bring us much activity. And Co-Activity. Our office move is now complete, and we’re at that place now where we can add some beauty and grace to our space and receive our first set of students this week. Community is knocking on our doors once again and we couldn’t be more excited!
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have new niche communities celebrating their “Grand Opening” this week. The Career Coaching Niche and the Emotional Intelligence Niche are our newest additions.  Please feel free to come by and visit. Also up and coming will be the geographical community of Greater Seattle Co-Active Coaches. Stay tuned.

  <td colspan="2" style="padding: 10 30 0 38"><p>  This month’s newsletter contains an article from our newly named niche, Women as Leaders, formerly known as Women at Work. We get to hear from our neighbors to the north, our friends from the Vancouver Co-Active Coaching Geographic Community. Our musing of the month seems quite timely, as one of the current discussions on the boards is the relationship between spirituality and coaching. Let’s see what Vince Gowmon, CPCC, has to say in the matter. We have our Wizardry for some technical assistance, the wonderfully poignant “Ask Judith” (also known as the “Dear Abby” of Co-Active Coaching) and will conclude with the calendar of events for the month of July.

    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There were themed meetings, such as the “Gremlin Party” in October, “Endings and Closure” in November and a “Future Self Gathering” in January. In April’s business-building meeting, local business coach Hartley Charach showed us that by clearly defining our niche and increasing market research, we can increase revenue with strategic sales efforts.       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?293@257.NaJFamjCiRk.14@.3c41045b" target="_blank" class="orange">Read the full article here.</a>

	<p align="left" style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0507/images/musing.jpg" width="85" height="124" align="right" class="border2">Integrating spirituality and coaching is an increasingly prevalent theme within the coaching community. The most common question seems to be: “How do I bring the two together so my practice is a veritable reflection of my authentic truth?”
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The answer lies in firstly realizing spirituality is not something concrete. It cannot be attained, learned or grasped mentally, and, therefore, it is not a process of adapting spiritual terminology, ideology and methodology into a coaching practice. Spirituality is a realization and expression of a deeper knowing, our unified field of consciousness. Spirit is immanent and, therefore, spirituality is a means of expressing that which is our essential nature. Spiritual coaching is our own unique way of answering the call of spirit and expressing its ineffable power through our presence, words and actions in the present moment, for the sake of supporting others to do the same.

Getting stuck with something? Don’t know how to change your email address? Can’t seem to remember your password and want to change it? Need to edit or delete a message you posted? Well, the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@498.44eIakcXhWV.0@.ee734a7" target="_blank" class="orange">Quick Help</a> is just the place for you. The link is located at the top right corner of every page right under the “Private Communities” link. Take some time to see what’s available for you. I’m sure you’ll find it useful. Not seeing something? Let me know, and I’ll see what I can do to add it to the section.
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Digests</strong><br>
Why am I getting someone else’s email digest in my in-box? Well, there’s an easy way to stop this. It’s not really their email digest, but a copy of it. And, we don’t know what we don’t know about how it will show up on the other end, so we simply hit reply. Let’s all post in a clean and thoughtful way. If you want to respond to a discussion, DO NOT HIT REPLY to an email digest. If your account is set to receive email in a digest form, to send a clear response, choose the red link,  <strong>Post a Message</strong>, from the original thread.  
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Article Submissions</strong> <br>	Is the Level 3 calling for you to say something or to share that thoughtful creative writing? Is your voice wanting to be heard? Then by gosh, email <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> using Member Musing in the title. Make sure you add a brief bio of yourself at the end. I’d love to have a few Musings to pull from.

	  <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear C.S.L.:
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You’ve gotten me curious. What makes your coach’s homework assignments so powerful for you? I bet that you can begin to find some good answers there.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I imagine that what works about your coach’s homework assignments are that they are tied to something that supports your passion and that they create learning. I find that the most powerful homework assignments emerge from what my clients are yearning for. The key to creating homework assignments with impact is to be listening not only to what your client is saying but to what they are not saying, as well. Homework is a great way to begin to give space to that which we haven’t yet voiced.

	  <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Coaching Demonstrations. I know you're out there wondering, “What do they know that is different from what I know?” “What is it that they are teaching?” “Could they teach me something new?” Well here is your chance to find out! In July, the Chicago Coach Federation will gather representatives from some of the most renowned coaching schools in the area. Here you will get an inside look into their philosophies, their curriculum, and their methods and techniques. You will see what makes each school successful and you will observe these successes first-hand, as representatives from each school illustrate them with a live coaching demonstration. Don't miss this rare opportunity to see what makes each school unique.
