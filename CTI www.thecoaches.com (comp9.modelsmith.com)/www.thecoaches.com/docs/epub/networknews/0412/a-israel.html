	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0412/edie-Ilan.jpg" width="86" height="121" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">Co-Activity is definitely going global! Less than two years ago, in January 2003, the first Fundamentals course took place in Israel. Less than two years later, December 2004, the first group of Co-Active coaches in Israel completes Synergy and moves toward certification. This is how things work in Israel. When something catches on, it grows like wildfire!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Co-Activity in Israel is on the move! About 90 people have completed  Fundamentals since the program began and many plan to continue toward certification. Many Co-Active coaches in Israel are seeking ways to integrate Co-Activity into their existing careers. Our diverse community comprises business leaders, educators, school administrators, public officials, doctors, dentists, lawyers, psychologists, organizational consultants and even a couple of sex counselors! Our community is also demographically diverse. We intend to soon have Arab Israelis participating in CTI courses in Israel. We are excited and optimistic about the impact this will have on our society.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our young Co-Active community shares a vision that when a critical mass of Israelis speak the language of Co-Activity and live in our values, we can amplify our shared value for peace in the Middle East. The road is a challenging one in this part of the world, but where isn't it these days?  We are committed to our path of Co-Activity and are full of gratitude for the many Co-Active coaches in North America and beyond who share our dream and play a part in making an impact on our little corner of the world. Our international support is in large part thanks to Wendy Gutin, CPCC, from Maryland, who initiated an amazing mentor initiative as her Leadership project. Thanks to all of the wonderful mentors who are also making an impact on our community. To date more than 50 Israeli coaches in training are matched with CPCC coaches in North America, Europe and Japan who are donating their time to help us grow as Co-Active coaches.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We also are grateful to every CTI leader who has led a course in Israel, starting with Juhree Zimmerman and Clark Friedrichs in January 2003, followed by Bev Knox, Eric Kroner, Lauren Powers, Elaine Gaston, Deborah Colman, Lorry Schneider and Lori Shook. Their enthusisam, love, support,  encouragement and availability to us as Co-Active pioneers in the Middle East keep us focused on our dreams at a time when fear and uncertainty can pull us down. They each in their own special way opened our hearts and  helped us view the world from a perpective of possibilities while challenging us to forward our actions in our country. I am certain Laura Whitworth and Henry Kimsey-House had no idea when they established CTI that their brilliant model would reach the Middle East and be a light of hope to our future. During this holiday season, we express our gratitude to all. Stay tuned for more information about what is happening "Co-Actively" in Israel. Click into our geographic community through the CTI website for more information and please join our community. We are curious to hear your questions and ideas about Co-Activity in Israel. Most of all, please visit us in Israel! Shalom, salem, peace to us all and wishes for a peaceful 2005.
