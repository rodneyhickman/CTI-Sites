	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Retirement Lifestyle Coaching Community Niche</b>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0412/barbara-walker.jpg" width="82" height="109" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">At the beginning of the movie "About Schmidt," Jack Nicholson sits in his empty office watching the clock tick away the final minutes of his working life. He gets up, puts on his coat and hat and goes to his retirement party. After listening to trivial speeches, Schmidt ends up in the bar alone. Welcome to retirement!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Schmidt is depressed and feeling useless and discarded. He is not only disconnected from his colleagues, he does not know who he is, who his wife is or who his daughter is. He is alone in an emotional wasteland having been too busy working to really be present in much of his own life.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After numerous inappropriate attempts to enjoy himself traveling in his RV, he returns home alone and opens a letter from World Vision, from a little boy in Africa. The child has sent a drawing of himself reaching up to hold the hand of a big man, namely Schmidt, who begins to cry as he realizes that this little stranger who lives miles across the ocean is the only person in the world to whom he is emotionally connected!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Is this too cruel? Not so&mdash;very realistic and very sad, and such experiences are what the Retirement Lifestyle coaches do not want to have happen to people when they retire. So how can retirement coaching make a difference? It can help people see what they want in their retirement lives before they retire. It can encourage people to build a new world into which to retire, and it can use evaluation instruments to indicate how prepared people are in specific areas of life that are crucial to success in retirement. In short, retirement coaching is the complement to financial planning&mdash;one is the money piece, and the other is everything else about life!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">People retiring now are well-educated, healthy, urban dwellers and they want anything but their parent's retirement. They are the huge group of Baby Boomers racing toward retirement. Every day in North America, 10,000 people turn 55 years of age! And they can expect to live 30 or more years in retirement due to increased life expectancy.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">But, they have not prepared themselves for retirement. Maybe they have done some financial planning which is an essential factor in a successful retirement, but most have not done any lifestyle planning.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Lifestyle planning is what our Retirement Lifestyle coaches are about. We know the demographics and we work together to discover where we can find our clients and how to package our services for them. We know that in not wanting to have their parents' retirement, the Baby Boomers are avoiding the programs at the Seniors Centers and the Early Bird Dinner specials, and our group of Retirement Lifestyle coaches has spent considerable time discussing how best to access our clients.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our Retirement Lifestyle Coaching Community niche is led by Judy Granius and Barbara Walker, and with our members on a monthly telebridge call, we began by listening to what we each felt we wanted the niche to be and what we needed from it. We continue to share resources and to support each other as we develop the fascinating arena of coaching people into their retirement years.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Many of the people we work with are part of the approximately 25% of retirees who are deciding to change careers at this stage of their lives. Nearly 50% of retirees plan to be self-employed as they want to work from home and start their own businesses or set themselves up as consultants. This group of entrepreneurs is one of the fastest growing segments of the economy.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There is huge enthusiasm for this work. The possibilities are enormous&mdash;just think, with millions of people retired and still in their active years what a difference this energy, passion and commitment could make in the world!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That is the exciting work on which we are embarked in the Retirement Lifestyle coaching niche!
	<p style="margin: 30 0 0 0">Our next telebridge call will be in January 2005. Please check the calendar on the Retirement Lifestyle Coaching Community niche web page for details.
