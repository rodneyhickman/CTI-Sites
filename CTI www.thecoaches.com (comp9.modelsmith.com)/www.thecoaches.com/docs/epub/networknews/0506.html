Being involved with the dynamic world of coaching for almost a decade has kept me alert and forward thinking, never a dull moment. Let’s keep evolving!

It was the penultimate day of our annual conference. The CALL (<a href="http://www.thecall.biz" target="_blank" class="orange">www.thecall.biz</a>) is a confederation of the nearly 1,000 alumni of the CTI Co-Active Leadership Program, AND it is so much more than that!

	    Let me share a story from another industry and another time. In 1730, cloth making was a cottage industry throughout England. Many individual weavers were scattered around the country creating cloth for their clients. Over the next 50 years, a series of technical revolutions would sweep through the industry. First, John Kay's flying shuttle in 1733 started things, quickly followed by Crompton's mule which produced large and cost-effective quantities of fine, strong yarn.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	As a result of these changes, by 1800, the number of workers needed to turn wool into yarn shrank by 80%. From 1780 to 1812, the cost of making cotton yarn dropped 90%.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hi Everyone,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Out of the Office</strong><br>
I’d love to toss out some acknowledgement out to those of you who have been quite resourceful in remembering to set your out of office reply feature on before you leave for an extended time. It’s making a difference. You know that I hold the bar pretty high on this one and there is still some room for improvement. Please remember to go to Manage Account in the left nav bar and click the box “no mail” and save your changes. Then remember to revisit Manage Account to uncheck that box and save those changes to get back to business as usual. I’m working my best to catch these as I see them. Help me help you to have a clean vibrant Network Community.

    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Discussions</strong><br>
I’ve been inspired by the power of conversation in the public discussion board on the Main Community. I’m seeing some very powerful communications taking place and my heart is full; even the spicy threads make me smile. Please make sure that if you’re replying to a discussion in your digest, and the entire digest gets pasted into the new email, that you edit the email to make it nice and clean. We love to bottom line.
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Article Submissions</strong><br>
Is the Level 3 calling for you to say something or to share that thoughtful creative writing? Is your voice wanting to be heard? Then by gosh, email <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> using Member Musing in the title. Make sure you add a brief bio of yourself at the end. I’d love to have a few Musings to pull from.

	  <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear L.A.:
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In my experience, celebrities are people first and celebrated people second. It is easy for coaches to get swept up in the celebrity's persona and lose sight of the person behind the story. This is especially true in this era of idolizing or demonizing celebrities and separating art and politics from our everyday life. Don't confuse the celebrity with the person. In my own minute brush with "celebrity," I have become very aware of the power of projection. Once one is seen as a public figure, all sorts of expectations get projected onto the person and, although this happens regularly with non-celebrities, it is a force that must definitely be dealt with to a much greater degree by people in the public eye. Don't ignore the celebrity aspect of this person, but don't get seduced by it either.
