	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/mossman.jpg" width="121" height="152" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">I lost my temper yesterday afternoon.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course, since I've developed significant awareness, the real treat was being able to watch myself&mdash;in full color and sharp focus&mdash;as I went over the edge.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It was a grey, rainy day, and knowing that videos are an option on rainy days, my beautiful 6-year-old son had asked to watch a movie following his after-school snack.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"Yes, as soon as you take your toys off the floor and put them on your table."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">His response didn't match my expectations: he didn't behave like the perfect child is supposed to. He dropped to the floor in protest and began whining.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Cai (that's his name…a Welsh spelling meaning "rejoice") was behaving like a 6-year-old boy who, after spending an entire rainy day stuck in a school room, was now being asked to do something he wasn't that keen on doing. Were I a 6-year-old boy, I could see where throwing myself on the floor might just seem like a viable option&mdash;a fitting expression of frustration after a long day staying still indoors. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Now a logical, enlightened response may have been to carefully examine a number of perspectives around the situation. You know: take out a Balance Wheel and have at it. Maybe take a look&mdash;from a Fulfillment angle&mdash;at what I, or we, stood to gain from one choice or another. Perhaps I could have taken a moment to look at possibilities for deepening my learning or forwarding the action around my relationship with this brilliant, blue-eyed miracle of a child before me. On the other hand, I could have taken a Process angle here. After all, wasn't there something I just couldn't be with?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hey, I'm a Leadership graduate! Here's an idea: Maybe I could have given myself full permission, been responsible for my impact and stuck around to clean it up&mdash;whatever "it" turned out to be. Maybe leaned in 100% percent, met him where he was, pointed him where I wanted him to go and danced with whatever showed up.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Yup, any of the above would have created a real father-son moment of true personal and relational growth.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So in the spirit of the moment, I did what I told myself I was no longer going to do: I lost it. I switched on the old "alpha dog" autopilot and went at him like a rogue wave bearing down on an unsuspecting fishing boat.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I had one of those moments you just don't want the world to see…
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I yelled.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I ranted.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I saw his 6-year-old chips on the table, and I raised the stakes considerably.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You want to see 6-year-old drama and rebellion? I'll show you 6-year-old drama and rebellion-plus 40!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Time out...
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As I watched myself go over that jagged precipice of anger, saw the heartbreak and tears on my son's face, felt the visceral coiling in my gut, I saw a man and a boy trading places.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I became the hard-to-handle student&mdash;he became the master teacher.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Cai's tears were real. He was doing what he does so well: living in the moment.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I was a twisted jumble of emotion, justification, shame, righteousness&mdash;all sorts of familiar feelings having little to do with what was going on in the here and now&mdash;and all aimed squarely at my son.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The dangerous nature of an autopilot response is that it's built on a foundation that is no longer viable, originally constructed in the distant past. At some point way back when, it may have made sense. Perhaps it was useful one or two times when I was 6 years old and didn't have the sophisticated recognition and verbal skills needed to express myself clearly to an adult.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Yesterday it was my expression of "I'm not in control of this other person, and I don't know what to do! I love him and he knows it, and therefore knows he is supposed to ___________." Fill in the blank with something that describes "be different than he is right now."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Were you a guest in my head at the time, you wouldn't have to look too far to track the path of my thoughts over the seconds, minutes and hours that followed. The inner judges, critics and limiting beliefs were having a field-day!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"Yo! Some father you are." 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"You call yourself a specialist at coaching fathers? Look at what you've just done, then tell us who you are trying to kid!"
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"You co-lead the Fatherhood Niche Community. What are you going to lead them through next…'Knife Play for Toddlers?'"
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Gremlin-Fest, you say? Hey, when I get going, I don't mess around.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Thank goodness for the resilience that my son so deftly exhibits each and every day of his young life.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While I was seasoning and simmering the stew of "the event" in my cranial kitchen, my son wandered off to do the thing he does best: play. He was over it. Cai had turned his attention to happily building, drawing and shining a flashlight on the wall in the next room.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"How do they do that?" I wondered.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I walked into his room and sat down to watch. Cai looked away from his toys, jumped up and gave me a hug.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">With all his 6-year-old wisdom, Cai knew just what to do. His expression of forgiveness and love stood as an incredible reminder that what matters most is this very moment.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That's how "they do that."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ah, sweet acceptance...
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It's a big lesson I learn over and over&mdash;particularly since becoming a father.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Where reality isn't, change can't happen. There's just no traction there.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Acceptance lets the past be the past and allows the future to come without expectation or attachment. It's a lesson that very young children do a marvelous job of teaching. Even when they teach from a place of their own attachments, they hold up a sign that says "You are the adult here. This is me acting like a 4, 5, 6 or ___ year-old. What will YOU choose?"
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hmmm. Thanks, Cai.
	<p style="margin: 30 0 0 0">The Fatherhood Niche Community, coordinated by Ken Mossman and Mark Brandenburg, is a meeting place for fathers and folks who coach fathers. Fatherhood matters. Sustainable change begins at home.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our next call, on the subject of "Acceptance and Unconditional Love in the Community of Men" will be held on Thursday, November 18, 2004, at 5:30 p.m. Pacific, 8:30 p.m. Eastern. (Please note: Due to the specific subject matter, November's call is open to men only.)
