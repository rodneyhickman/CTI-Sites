	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Greetings Co-Active Friends and Colleagues,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This month, our Level 3 is abuzz with activity! From the CALL to Action Marathon (it's not too late to donate... <a class="orange" href="http://www.thecallmarathon.com" target="blank">www.thecallmarathon.com</a>), to preparation for the ICF Conference (it's not too late to sign up... <a class="orange" href="http://www.coachfederation.org/conference" target="blank">www.coachfederation.org/conference</a>), to CTI's first courses being offered in Spain (taught in Spanish!), our community is out making a difference in the world. Accordingly, this month's columns reflect our community's level of commitment to doing meaningful work.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In this month's feature article on the Social Action and Coaching niche, Virginia Kellogg challenges us to "claim your ability to shape the world to match your ideals and dreams."   Taking this cue, Wendy Gutin and her team of Mentor Coaches for Israel share their ideals and dreams in "Member Musings." Our featured geographic region, Toronto, invites us to "inspire our fellow coaches to discover their true purpose and create their niche from the passion that drives them." Come learn how our Toronto members are putting this into action for one another.

Thank you, Virginia Kellogg, for making this happen!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And, lastly, speaking of the ICF Conference, for those who cannot attend, we're currently cooking up a way to bring you daily updates from the conference via the Co-Active Network website. Stay tuned for more information.

In order to spread the magic of celebration and connect to CTI's students in a heartfelt, authentic way, Henry Kimsey-House did a celebration tour of several cities in which CTI held its workshops. Many of us, who had already taken some CTI workshops, were excited and went to hear Henry speak. Inspired by his passion, we connected to the deep fire within ourselves. We spoke of building a community here in Toronto, a place in which we could share the magic, the mystery and the co-active model we had each absorbed through our training. Many of us, having completed our core courses, were searching for a way to come together, regularly, to begin sharing our ideas and dreams for the future. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Toronto, at the time, did not have a local community of its own. A handful of us decided to meet in "Quotes" a nearby bar and grill, to begin to see what was possible by creating one. We saw that we were planting seeds that would take time to spread roots, grow and flourish.

Recently, I held a bridge call for those who are current and future mentors for a new coach in Israel, to connect and share experiences. On the call, I spoke of my vision for us as a community, and I read a compilation of answers from these same mentors to this question: What is your vision of how co-active coaching can positively impact Israel? I want to share the words of these wonderful mentors with you, as they really do speak to our common vision and goal for this community and this undertaking. Here they are:</p>

	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine what would happen in this tumultuous corner of the world if people really did accept one another as naturally creative, resourceful and whole.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine if co-activity in Israel can actually become a model for differing views, beliefs and cultures to work together to create a better world for themselves.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that co-activity truly becomes accepted in Israel and the entire Middle East as a form of respectful alliance, and that community can set an example and inspire both individuals and groups throughout the region.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that co-active coaches in Israel will have the vision to make a difference for Israelis and Palestinians alike, and show the world that understanding of self and others leads to peaceful coexistence and that not only is it possible, but it is the only way for human survival.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that Israel will be a "messenger unto the peoples of the Earth," to show people that there is another way of problem-solving and communicating, using the "heart-centered" premise of co-activity as one of the necessities for moving through generational hatred and violence.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that the positive impact of co-activity on each individual in Israel will help build a nation of people who have conscious awareness to take responsibility and become contributors to peace.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that the impact of co-activity on Israel is one that results in a creative and uplifting manner of relationship, problem-solving and conflict resolution, through its focus on individuals striving for a "grass root" transformation process that honors human dignity and peace.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that co-active coaching inspires truth telling on both sides, so that when ordinary people can speak about their fears and their hopes with those on the other side of the conflict, a groundswell will emerge among young people that conflict is not the way we want to live our lives.
	<p style="margin: 0 0 10 0">Imagine that co-active coaching skills will be brought to parties desiring to move beyond an entrenched "us vs. them" stance and will likewise teach people how to navigate the very difficult process of forgiveness and peace building.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">To change your log-in information, simply log-in to the Co-Active Network using your current (soon to be old) email address and password. After being logged in, choose "Manage Account" from the left-side navigation bar. (This is the green margin on the left; in "techie" terms, we call this the "nav bar," FYI.) You are then brought to the "Manage Account" page, and at the top you will see your current email address followed by two links to either (Change Email) or (Change Password).  Simply click on your preference and follow the prompts. Voila!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Next, I'll give you a couple of updates on the system at large.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We know that there have been some inconsistencies on the receipt of emails from the Co-Active Network. This is happening when we send reminders for call-in bridge numbers to various network events. Please know that I'm in dialogue with MY tech support to resolve this matter.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This is what we know so far...
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Bottom line: it's a known issue with RoadRunner (rr.com) and it's server-side spam filtering at fault. About the only thing we can do right now is suggest that you sign up with a different email provider. We're sorry for the inconvenience of this, big time!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'll also add a quote from my "wizard-ress." "My strong suspicions are that the problems people are having are either because their address is entered wrong, there is a server-side spam filter somewhere eating the mail for whatever misguided reason, or they have a spam filter in their email program which is identifying the message as spam for whatever misguided reason."  I thought this great information to share as it seems it's not such a black-and-white issue.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Another "work-around" is that we're going to start posting the call-in numbers in the event descriptions prior to the calls. We're working out the logistics on this with our Community Organizers. We may add the numbers to the description about a week or so prior to the event(s). Please still choose the "Sign me up to attend" button so that we track availability and space for the call. We're blessed to be in the presence of such high integrity with this community. Phew, no problems here!  :O)
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And lastly, you will notice that I've been doing some "laundry" in the Main Community's public discussion area. I've created an "Archived Discussion" folder for discussion a month or older. They are still available and have great depth and information there. Also, we've created a "CTI's Founders' Corner" to hold their musings in one place.

	<p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">We know that an awareness of where one is in body, in mind and in spirit, along with an intention to have each of these integrate with the other, leads to a very effective life. We know lots of therapies and exercises and books. Start with the assumption that your effectiveness as a coach comes from coaching a client to balance and BMS integration, and that your client is unaware of BMS. We are going to design an intake together and publish it here on the BMS website. We will then seek feedback on this model in public discussion. Consider the foundation of body resources, mind resources and spirit resources you want to discover. What do you need to know? What resources will you recommend to your client? Why that particular one? Call 440-377-9715, x-565.
