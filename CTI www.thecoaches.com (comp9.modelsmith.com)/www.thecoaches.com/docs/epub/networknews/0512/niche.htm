<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Rainbow Pride Niche </b></p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0512/images/niche0512.jpg" width="90" height="54" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">When we started the Rainbow Pride Niche for gay, lesbian, bisexual,  transgender, tran-sexual, two-spirit, inter-sex and queer folks, it seemed like  a good idea to get the rainbow up and flying on the Co-Active network. I  experienced some personal trepidation at &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; to the whole coaching  community. I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was the right person to lead the GLBT  community&mdash;what do I know? Who am I to be a leader of this community? I don&rsquo;t  even have &ldquo;gaydar&rdquo;&mdash;that inner radar that tells you when someone else is gay. People  have to come out to me over and over&mdash;and usually I need my partner to tell me  that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m part of the family&rdquo; or something similar doesn&rsquo;t just mean they are  friendly. That said, I have been learning something new. I am new at  Co-Actively &ldquo;leading&rdquo; a community. I am new to being out on the Internet. I ask  myself constantly, &ldquo;What is important for the queer community in Co-Active  space?&rdquo; But today I am pondering what is important for the Co-Active community  about queer space?</p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My partner and I have been watching back episodes of &ldquo;Queer  as Folk.&rdquo; I am so curious about what it must be like for the straight actors to  &ldquo;be with&rdquo; the steamy gay sex scenes and queer culture on the show. I wonder how  their acceptance of their roles has changed them as human beings. &ldquo;Queer as  Folk&rdquo; has been so educational for many of my straight and gay friends. It has  brought queer life into gay homes and straight homes across North America. There  is a huge demographic of straight women who watch &ldquo;Queer as Folk.&rdquo; I think of  the impact of those straight actors playing gay roles. They have been more  successful at social change in gay issues than many gay activists have been!</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I wonder what impact we as queer coaches are having in the  world. What kind of impact can we Rainbow Pride Co-Active Coaches have on the  coaching community? I know that having a gay-friendly niche may allow someone  queer to feel welcomed and able to participate in the broader community. We can  use the Rainbow Coaches Niche to create a safe space for ourselves, a little  community where it is OK to be part of the GLBT community. Our little space. But  what if we can be bigger than this? What impact can we have on the greater  community as a group of united queer coaches? What kind of impact would we like  to have?</p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There are three areas that came to my mind today that queer  culture might be able to contribute to coaching space, and I am sure there are  many more. The first is in the area of authenticity. The gay culture can be so  flamboyant&hellip;so beautiful&hellip;so big. There is so much permission in queer space. As  coaches we help people be huge. What can we bring from our queer space to help  people be huge? Think Drag Queen! </p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The second is in the area of courage. We model courage daily  by living our lives openly. Courage to be out. Courage to ask for equal rights.  Courage to marry and hold hands in public. Courage to march in a PRIDE parade  with my three children. Courage to challenge laws that keep us small. Courage  to live a full life. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The third area that I think gay culture has to offer  coaching is in designing the alliance. In the queer world, negotiation and  dialogue are more prominent in relationships than they are in straight  culture&mdash;think of the hanky code. (For more info, Google &ldquo;hanky code.&rdquo;)&nbsp; Straightforward communication is  perspective-changing and life-changing. Is there anything we have to contribute  from queer culture to the designed alliance? </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What would excellence look like for us as Co-Active Queer Coaches?  If we really called ourselves forth to be great coaches and great members of  the GLBT community, what would we do? What impact would we have?</p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I would like to call you forth to look at the ways that you  can have as much impact on the coaching community as a straight actor playing a  gay man has had with &ldquo;Queer as Folk.&rdquo; If you are gay, are you making coaching  available to your queer friends? Are you calling them forth fully? Are you  living your own life in courage and authenticity? If you are straight, are you  an advocate for gay rights? Have you learned how to be a gay advocate and ally?  Are we, as Co-Active coaches, comfortable playing it safe in a small world, or  are we ready to grow our impact? Are we ready to embrace all that we really  are? Are we ready to reach for excellence and learn something new? </p>
