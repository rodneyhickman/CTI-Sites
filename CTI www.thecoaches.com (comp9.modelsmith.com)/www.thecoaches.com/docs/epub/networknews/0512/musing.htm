	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    Let's consider how much we might learn from the unexpected reactions to  coaching that we can be sure to receive if we work with French people. Most  likely, we'll be asked to clarify concepts and principles abstractly, but more  directly and succinctly than we might be used to. The French mind-set is very Cartesian,  that is, logical and linear thinking are idealized...and people are judged by  their ability to explain themselves using &quot;le mot juste,&quot; the right  word that exactly fits the occasion. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    This said, the exact mapping and translation of terms is exactly what you want  to withhold from your French clients. They want to understand concepts so that  they can judge whether they like them or don't like them: whether they make  sense to them or not, based on previously lived (or secondary and interpreted)  experience. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    What you want to do is to facilitate experiential learning that allows them to  do the work of mapping after they have lived an experience. Overall, what I am  getting at here is that most people deprive themselves of experiences that fall  beyond their culturally dictated parameters. This is particularly true with the  French. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    For this reason, I believe that even if one knows French, but you have clients  who also speak English, then use English, and ask them to make the effort to  speak in a different way. This will also encourage them to think beyond the  Cartesian blinders that hinder a more immediate access to the power of metaphor  and imagination. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    We could not have asked for a clearer sign than the recent events of widespread  rioting to underscore the problem of sclerotic thinking on both fronts. This  also underlines the fact that the sense of one homogeneous cultural identity in  France is already history, or worse, a nostalgic wish for a return to the past.  Coaching is about hope for the future, which is sorely lacking throughout the  country. Because of this, a great deal of frustration that has been building is  now being unleashed through violence. If the French leaders were truly leaders  and visionaries, they would have been able to step beyond the confines of their  cultural trance and their elaborately crafted identities to propose more  creative solutions, or at least, new ways of thinking about the problems. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    If you want to work with the French, concentrate on helping them to gain  confidence in their innate (but heretofore ignored) capacities for coming up  with their own creative solutions. Don't find these solutions for them, or lead  them to your own, or you will fail to convince them. They will humour you, as  though you were but a naive, unsophisticated and gullible emissary of the New  Age on a crusade to convert them into something that they could never imagine  being. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    No: instead, make them walk barefoot in the unknown hinterlands of the  imagination they were forced to abandon when their teachers used fear and the  threat of embarrassment before their peers to shame them for who they were, so  they would forever be afraid to become who they were, lest they be marginalized  and seen as etrange (strange). Accompany them as a compassionate ally on a  healing journey. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    Give them opportunities to show them that they are safe with you, and can try  on new ways of seeing. From experience, I can tell you that it will be easier  for them to go the distance with you if they are able to step outside the confines  of the self-same language that colors every aspect of their thinking. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    French, while it may sound beautiful to you, is the language that was used by  powerful people in their lives to wound them when they were too small to defend  themselves. Ironically, a chance to practice speaking their thoughts in a  foreign language can offer an opportunity to reclaim their authentic voices  with empowerment. Should these begin to emerge, you will begin to hear exciting  talk sourced in the language of desire, fueled by the will to action they never  would have been able to imagine possible. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    At times, their resistance may seem impossibly intense, but the transformative  changes that you will help catalyze by affording them an opportunity to step  outside the rigid confines of their disembodied schemas last a lifetime, and  they will remember you for it, and reward you with their loyalty. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	    In summary: whenever possible, insist on facilitating safe and non-judgmental  exercises that nurture active imagination, promote embodied participation, and  refuse to settle for anything less than hope. Find creative ways to let them  discover how to feel creative and resourceful on their own.
