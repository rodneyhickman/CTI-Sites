  <p> <b>Co-Active Coaching Network Norway</b></p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Co-Activity in Norway  is blooming and the Network is seeing more and more interest from both aspiring  coaches, as well as consumers wondering what this coaching thing is all about!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The Network has  recently upgraded and updated its website and are welcoming in the next  generation of leaders. Majken Askeland and Christopher F&uuml;rst are taking over  the helm in 2006 after two exciting years with Sigrid Kjeldsen and Jan Rams&oslash;y  in the front seat. Majken and Christopher will also have the assistance of  Unndis Settevik with the financial coordination. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have quadrupled in  members, with membership recently passing the 100 mark! We have a lot to offer  to our members, both those established as well as those in the start phase of  their coaching businesses. Such things include interesting tools and resources,  gadgets and business development support tools and services, not to mention  monthly meetings with various topics&mdash;all aiding our coaches on the fast track  to developing (and re-developing) their business.</p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our new leaders,  Majken and Christopher, are equally passionate about professionalizing the  coaching industry and are starting their term focusing on how we can, as a  network, both build an even more dynamic space within the Network, as well as  develop our image as a serious player within the coaching industry here in  Norway. They recently launched a workshop (early November) in which they  initiated this dialogue. Much exciting work ahead of us!</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Organization and  Relationship Systems Coaching Program is now in Europe and has launched its  first fundamentals course in Oslo in October. The founders, Marita Fridjhon and  Faith Fuller, led the course with Leni Chr. Jebsen and Jan Rams&oslash;y as  assistants. The 33 participants enjoyed every minute of the course and said it  was sorely needed on this side of the Atlantic and a huge asset to any coach&rsquo;s  training portfolio. Many will continue through the rest of the modules, and the  first seed of an ORSC network is in the works, headed by Leni Chr. Jebsen.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Leadership has had  four new Norwegian leaders graduating, and more than 20 people in Norway have already been through the Leadership  Program. The Norwegian graduates are planning a call in February to develop a  way to become resources for each other in light of the growing number of  Leadership graduates. </p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The first snow has  appeared, temperatures are below freezing, and the winter is taking its hold on  Norway. But the warmth in our work and in our community helps to keeping us  warm and uplifted (even in the 16 hours of darkness each day!). We look upon  2006 to be an even greater and more exciting year for Co-Activity in Norway!</p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Seasons greetings, and  we wish you all the best for the New Year!</p>
