	  <b>by Gilly Weinstein</b>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of  time researching crabs lately. The larger kind, those tough, truly bizarre  creatures that don&rsquo;t seem to need anyone or anything. Garbage men of the sea,  symbols for cancer, meanness incarnate, finger-lickin&rsquo; feast&hellip; Crabs conjure up  the most diverse cultural and emotional associations. Including, as it turns  out for me, an apt reminder of what growing stronger&mdash;or just plain  growing&mdash;means. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What started as a  high-intensive-effort to help my daughter with a school project blossomed into  a full-blown fascination. Thanks to the whims of a moody science teacher (&ldquo;This  sucks! All the cool invertebrates were taken, now I&rsquo;m stuck with the stupid  crab!&rdquo;), I now know more about these critters than anyone needs to. Like, get  this: crabs continue to grow incessantly throughout their entire life. This  steady expansion is what causes them to molt, i.e. crack their shell, extract  themselves from it and move on&mdash;up to 20 times in a modest three-year life span.  They do this in different ways. Mostly, they flush their innards so thoroughly  with water that they literally pop out of themselves. Within 30 minutes, less  in some cases, the crab is alleviated of his or her old shell and experiences  the true condition of an invertebrate&mdash;no skeleton, all flesh, pretty raw. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It&rsquo;s at this precise  time&mdash;while waiting for the new &ldquo;soft&rdquo; shell to harden&mdash;that crabs are at their  most fragile. Otherwise equipped to handle pretty much anything life throws  their way, crabs become defenseless, almost endearingly vulnerable, during the  molting phase. It&rsquo;s also at this juncture that wonderful things happen, like  mating. Males seek out just-molted females, and vice-versa, to establish the  kind of contact that armor would, well, inhibit. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As my enthusiasm over these  minor discoveries bubbled, I suddenly realized what was resonating so loudly: I  too have molted! Possibly several times in my life without knowing it, but most  certainly, and in Technicolor, this past year. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Like my kindred 10-legged  fellows, my molting saw me crack out of a shell that was hindering my growth. A  shell that had become so tight, it took some mega-heaving to finally pop out of  it. And even then, smarting and glancing around nervously from the taxing  effort, I still had to wonder, am I better off now? </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My molting involved shedding  a relationship that had taken complete hold of my being, except it wasn&rsquo;t  serving me anymore&mdash;at all. In many ways, and yes hindsight is always 20/20,  clinging to this relationship was interfering with my ability to share myself  with the world, to engage more deeply with friends, to be in the moment and  even&mdash;gasp and drumroll!&mdash;to call clients forth with the power befitting a coach  preaching authenticity. In short everyone was loosing out.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">But my shell held fast. And  no one, not even my superbly skilled coach, could pull me out of myself. I had  to crack this one alone. And by God did it take time. There was, to be sure,  much process around what holding on to a so-over relationship was doing to me.  There was perspectives work galore on what energy and possibilities I could  access were I to flush this person from my brain and heart. There was  fulfillment work exploring the values I was satisfying/violating by flogging a  dead horse. It felt tiring at times, worth it at others; there were peaks and  troughs, we kept at it. We gave The Model a run for its money.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Looking back, it was all part  of that crazy, crooked crawl so characteristic of crabs. There&rsquo;s plenty of  darting around, some acrobatic scrambling, some record-breaking sprints but  overall, a lot of hiding in rocks, a lot of scurrying for comfort. Deft and  coordinated as crabs may be, they&rsquo;re always seeking the easy way out, making  for shelter, avoiding danger&hellip;and anything that smacks of a challenge.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And then comes molting  season, which gives the old you-can-run-but-you-can&rsquo;t-hide new meaning. Every  crab molts at his or her own pace, different seasons, different intervals,  different speeds. My own? I can now say it unfolded for well over 12 months.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until I&rsquo;d stepped away from the carcass of my old shell that I  understood it was happening, or was indeed done with. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As I pored over Wikipedia and  National Geographic pages with my daughter, I suddenly knew what had been so  trying about these past months: My maturing shell, still soft, left my  vulnerability exposed, with all the fear, sadness and excitement this entails.  It was still Me, albeit unrecognizable to myself at times, just Me between  phases. Or rather those, umm, in-between phases that are as daunting as they  are rich in learning. That journey, I can now say for certain, laid the  foundation on which the rest of my life now rests. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I believe it is only by  molting that we can fully experience the spectrum of emotions we need to work  through, to free ourselves from whatever is holding us back. Going from  strength to strength involves bouts of fragility, for crabs and humans. I  believe that holding onto our shell at all costs, be it thick or thin, pretty  or barnacled, is deceptively easy, but not viable. I am so grateful to be  growing again, not least because everyone, from my children to my clients, is  reaping the benefit. I believe we all need to molt to grow. </p>
