Greetings Everyone,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’m assuming that this is one of those warm and fuzzy times of year for most everyone. I’m increasingly warmed by the gracious hearts here on the Co-Active Network. I am warmed knowing that I’ll be spending special moments with friends and family this season. I will feel all the fuzzy sweaters my dear friends and family will be wearing as I hug them over and over again. Feeling fuzzy also implies a feeling of an energetic electrical tingling on my skin when love is present. Who could ask for anything more?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have had a glorious year on the Co-Active Network. We’ve added more <a href="#niche" class="orange">niche</a> communities and new <a href="#geography" class="orange">geographic </a>communities as well. We’ve had numerous private communities created from the Co-Active Leadership Program groups and the Co-Active Certification pods—lots of activity. I look forward to the future and want to pause and reflect on a year of celebration and gratitude. We’ll visit the future next month.

(GLBT, for you straight people out there, is gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender.)  The topics we discuss are applicable for everyone in the coaching profession. The gifts the GLBT community has are vast, in part, because of the challenges we face in our everyday lives.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There are several big contributions the GLBT community has to make to the world of coaching:  
      <ol>
        <li>Living a full life in the presence of detractors or homophobia or saboteurs.  </li>
        <li>Support for those who are “coming out” and stepping into authenticity.</li>
        <li>Transition from where we are to where we want to be. </li>
        <li>Understanding of the myriad perspectives that make up human sexuality and humanness. </li>
      </ol>

It’s an energy that people want to be around. People who have experienced Co-Active coaching, a CTI course, the CTI booth or events at the ICF Conference get it. Clients who experience Co-Actively trained coaches and leaders know it is different. And the Co-Active Network is different because of it.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What would happen to the world if CTI coaches met as a community each month?  
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The answer, it turns out, is a powerful one…powerful enough to change a person’s life, move a community forward and connect the world.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">But when Charlie Kilczewski, CPCC, first asked that question in 2001, we weren’t quite sure what to expect. But by asking the question, he inspired 20 Co-Active coaches in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area to meet for the first time, curious as to what would unfold. The result was powerful stuff: a consistent time and space for people to meet, the opportunity to try a variety of potluck foods and, most importantly, the ability to build a community in every sense of the word.

The larger kind, those tough, truly bizarre creatures that don’t seem to need anyone or anything. Garbage men of the sea, symbols for cancer, meanness incarnate, finger-lickin’ feast… Crabs conjure up the most diverse cultural and emotional associations. Including, as it turns out for me, an apt reminder of what growing stronger—or just plain growing—means. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What started as a high-intensive-effort to help my daughter with a school project blossomed into a full-blown fascination. Thanks to the whims of a moody science teacher (“This sucks! All the cool invertebrates were taken, now I’m stuck with the stupid crab!”), I now know more about these critters than anyone needs to. Like, get this: crabs continue to grow incessantly throughout their entire life. This steady expansion is what causes them to molt, i.e. crack their shell, extract themselves from it and move on—up to 20 times in a modest three-year life span. They do this in different ways. Mostly, they flush their innards so thoroughly with water that they literally pop out of themselves. Within 30 minutes, less in some cases, the crab is alleviated of his or her old shell and experiences the true condition of an invertebrate—no skeleton, all flesh, pretty raw.

    <p>Dear JZ, <br>
Fortunately, “being perfect” will never need an antidote because perfection is an ideal state and thus to my mind can never be fully reached. Perfection can, however, serve as a calling forth of our best selves. In that way, it can be honored both as an ideal and as a tool.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">The focus this month will be on updates to member projects on coaching and leadership with youth: who is doing what with whom, where; who needs help with the work they are doing with youth. We are still looking for volunteers to help with this site and other work with youth. Hope to see you on the call.
