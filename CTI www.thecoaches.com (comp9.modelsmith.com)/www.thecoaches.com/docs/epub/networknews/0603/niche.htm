      <p><b>Artist as Leader</b></p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0603/images/niche.jpg" width="94" height="127" hspace="10" align="right">We hold our clients naturally creative, resourceful and whole, right?
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“Naturally creative.” What does that mean? Both words have their roots in the same meaning. “Nature” comes from <i>nasci</i>, meaning “to be born.” “Create” comes from <i>creare</i>, meaning “to make, produce, arise, grow.”
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In practical terms, it means that creativity isn’t reserved for the artist. In fact, creativity is your natural state of being. You’re creating every second of every day, even when you don’t feel it. You need only look at your nighttime dreams for proof: what could be more creative than to turn off your body and mind and still make a fantastic movie, even if you’re the only audience member.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Creativity is like love, sex, thirst: as innate as the need to eat. It’s rooted in desire. Remember that most basic of all coaching questions: “What do you want?” Not, “How will you get it,” or “Why do you want it?” It’s more like, “What’s that deep visceral longing, the thing your heart is yearning for?”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Creativity is not just a means to an end, but an end in itself.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’ve heard many of my clients describe themselves at their most creative as letting go of control and allowing a force to take them over. They are no longer the creator, but rather a vessel for creation to move through them and create. The actor is not the performer speaking lines, but <i>actually the character:</i> filled with desire and passion, spontaneously reacting, without conscious thought, yet supremely present to the moment and action at hand. The musician reaches a point where she’s not playing the music, but one with it. The painter quits painting and allows his hand to be guided. What could be more delicious?
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So if creativity is our natural state, and we’re a tool of our own creativity all the time anyway, what’s the difference between the artist and the non-artist?

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For me, it comes down to a simple matter of <i>choosing expression</i>. The artist decides she will give voice to what is in her heart at the deepest levels. She chooses to coax that force to move through her and speak to the world.
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re not talking about simple communication here. How can I move you by explaining Picasso’s <i>Guernica</i>? How can you fully feel the beautiful side of insanity, if I only tell you about <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>? How can I make your heart sing by describing Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i>? It is only the experience—the rich interplay between the artist and the one receiving the art—that can touch your heart.
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So what? Creativity and choosing expression is all sweet and lovely, and still, what does it have to do with anything? Art can only be important if it comes out of the crate and changes the minds and hearts of those who change the world. Henry Miller said, “The real leader has no need to lead; he is content to point the way.” Of course, true leadership is, in fact, <i>pointing the way</i>. 
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s the same with coaching artists. Playwright John Patrick Shanley says, “Theatre is a safe place to do the unsafe things that need to be done.” Sound familiar?

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We, the leaders of the Coaches of Creative Artists community invite you to come and express yourself with us. Please visit our webpage on the Co-Active Network, or join us on a monthly community call.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Regardless of whom you coach, I leave you with an inquiry:

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What would the world be like if nobody expressed their natural creativity?
