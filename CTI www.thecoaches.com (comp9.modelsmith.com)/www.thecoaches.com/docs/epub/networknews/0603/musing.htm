And I remember that anytime somebody questioned us “future world-changers,” I’d simply respond “just you watch.” And suffice it to say, after working with Girls’ Inc. and Coaching Kids, I may not have changed the world but I certainly feel that I’ve made a journey worth watching. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	I have to admit, it is amazing how many things you learn when your mind is dead set on teaching. Walking into Girls’ Inc for the first time I had no idea what to expect, but I knew that somewhere along the way I’d have my chance to share with these girls all that I’ve learned and maybe one day make a difference in their lives. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ironically enough, I wasn’t even close to telling them my name before they changed mine. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Some would call it “expected” and a trite twist of fate, but when it happens to you, it truly takes your breath away. It is a strange feeling, to say the least, to walk into a room and realize that in one way or another each one of these girls helped changed who you are. I’m not going to lie, the first time I ever walked into one of the Coaching Kids classes, I was a bit overwhelmed. From the second you enter the room to the second you leave, dozens of little eyes are staring at you and waiting for your next move. And if you don’t know these girls, it’s an absolutely terrifying experience. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	But these girls are all one of a kind. With their own amazing sense of individuality and a uniqueness found only within themselves, they have managed to come together and embrace each other as sisters. It’s corny, I know. But it’s not something that happens too often in our modern-day, less-than-idealistic world. It’s not too often that we, as a society, can observe people embracing each other without prejudice or discrimination. It is a very rare thing now, no matter how much we deny it, and the fact that these girls can come together as one, regardless of their age, race, and religions is something that we can all look to for inspiration. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	When I was first offered the opportunity to write this article, I saw it as a chance to tell everyone “how cool coaching is.” But as the article progressed, I realized that the wonderful benefits and complexities of coaching present themselves. It’s obvious in the way a “coach” will speak, and you will hear it in their voice. You will see it in their walk, and witness it in the girls’ eyes. Coaching isn’t just a “career,” or even a mere job choice. It is a passion that these people have chosen to pursue in, and change lives in the process. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Writers are supposed to write about what they know. And if there is one thing I do know, it’s this: they’ve changed mine. 
	
<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">Oanh Pham<br>

Age 18<br>

Assistant to Coaching Kids, Inc. “Coaching Skills for Girls” at Girls Inc.-Denver


<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><i>“Oanh Pham is an 18 year old Vietnamese girl who used to live in an apartment near me.  We became friends and she volunteered to do some administrative work for Coaching Kids, Inc., including assisting with the Girls Inc. classes. A little background on Oanh: her father escaped on the last helicopter out of Saigon at the end of the war, and five years later reunited with Oanh’s mother and sister – the sole survivor of twins – in America. They eventually ended up in Colorado, where Oanh just finished high school in July.  We are proud of our volunteers like her.”  </i><br>
