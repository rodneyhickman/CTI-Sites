  <p><b>Co-Active Network Sweden & Denmark</b></p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0603/images/sweden_demark.jpg" width="154" height="55" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The community was started at the same time as the opening of the public CTI courses in the two countries in the spring of 2004. 
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The first members where enthusiasts from Sweden and Denmark who, prior to establishment of the network, already had participated in CTI courses in USA, UK and Norway. Today, more than 200 people have participated in CTI courses in the region; it has helped increase the current member list to 85 names.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The CTI courses have developed well in the region. Since the first Fundamentals in May 2004, there are now four teams (a team is a course roster that goes through the intermediate courses together) graduated from the Co-Active Coaching curriculum, and team No. 5 starts out with Fulfillment in the beginning of April 2006.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The development has been supported strongly by different events created and managed by community member coaches.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">All events have been very well received. The biggest success was in Malmo late 2004, when CTI leaders Lori Shook and Eric Kohner were invited to lead an open house. More than 50 participants had a wonderful evening, with coaching demos, coaching each other, and a lot of questions and answers.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">With the help and support from several CTI leaders and member coaches since the start, we’ve had more than 20 events in which CTI leaders or members from the community have been active in open houses and information meetings about Co-Active Coaching and CTI in general. A lot of interested people who are not yet coaches have also visited these events to learn more about Co-Active Coaching. The latest event was a month ago in Copenhagen in which 35 members from a network of career women participated in an evening of Co-Active Coaching and its magic with Tine Gaihede, CPCC, and Bo Pedersen, from CTI Sweden & Denmark, as magicians.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CTI leaders and member coaches have also been co-active with the local ICF chapters and local coaching companies to help the quality assurance of coaching to increase in the region.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And now the community members are opening up activities in local cities in Sweden and Denmark. Three new community organizers are establishing activities in Gothenburg and Stockholm in Sweden, and a new community organizer will start up activities in Aarhus, Odense, and in Copenhagen, Denmark, within a few weeks. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Next up in the community, when writing this, is a teleclass with the famous Judith Cohen.
Community members have been invited to participate in a one-hour “Ask Judith” session.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So the community is growing and increasing its activities like rings on the water, first small-small and then bigger and bigger.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">With our best wishes to all Co-Active Network members all over the world,
