I believe that all the coaches reading this have been showering their clients with learning, thus providing quite a growing bouquet of inspiration and joy. The fragrance is sweet and the air is fresh. Keep showering your clients and let the sunshine in!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And I love it when they ask that question! After all, they are being curious and I’ve got lots to tell them about the topic. I love the opportunity to educate people about a tool that goes way beyond the limited scope of a diet.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here’s what I know: If we adopt a diet or an exercise plan, it works temporarily, while we are following it. Once adherence (as the fitness community is fond of calling it) waivers, the weight comes back, as if it’s been on a little hike and is coming home to rest. If we change deeper attitudes about food (and ourselves and even life!), permanent change occurs.

It feels as if, soon, we’ll be able to just step over it. We old Europeans, and I’m talking about ancient cultures rather than ancient coaches, have sometimes felt a little isolated. After all, coaching was “invented” in America and we’re a decade behind the times. As recently as a couple of years ago, there were doubts that we might ever be able to stand on our own two feet and contribute fully to the great international community of Co-Activity. Not any more. Things are happening quickly. Our sapling continues to shoot upwards and spread its roots.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The number of countries holding Co-Active coaching courses grows almost by the month. The leadership programme is safely transplanted across the pond. And we’re holding our sixth European Co-Active Coaches community day in May—to which you’re all invited.

Sometimes, I sit at my desk until two minutes before the client is to call, madly checking e-mails and feverishly surfing my yahoo. Or I’ve taken the thoughtful approach: light a nice, smelly candle, spend 15 minutes reviewing the client’s notes and homework assignments, and make a rough plan of the things I want to remember to cover (a.k.a. remind of late payment!). I’ve coached from my office, with the window overlooking tall trees, or from the leisure of the living room couch, or even sitting cross-legged on my bed, propped up with many pillows. I’ve been in my PJs, or full-on “hard clothes” and shoes. I’ve taken calls back-to-back or splat in the middle of a day of nothing going on.

    <p>Dear S.T.: <br>
      This seems to be a typical phase that many new coaches go through when they start their coaching practices. On one hand, it is a good sign that you care about your clients and are committed to doing a good job. On the other hand, these concerned thoughts may be sourced by your saboteurs and, thus, need to be managed.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Join us for a cozy virtual salon call. There will be no celebrity guest. This will NOT be a call where you mute the line and take notes. This is an opportunity to get to know one another better and to share insights, ask questions and play together. We often hear ourselves or clients say: "I need to create the space." Whether in our calendars or in our homes and studios, there is something about space that is important to us. What do we make up about space? What's important about space? How does space interact with time? What kind of space is most conducive to your creativity? If the space were set, would the rest flow? (If we build it, will they come?) Where the conversation may go is a mystery and that's the fun of it. I will be heading the call, along with my cohorts Robin Jones and Cynthia Morris, and these days I am especially interested in space. See you then.
