	  Hello Fabulous Community,
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There’s nothing quite so satisfying as to see the generous and exploding popularity of coaching high school students and youth in general. There is a dynamic thread currently on the boards with members coming forward to contribute to this population. This is impact in the making. This is what it’s all about, folks! Collaborative sharing and insights that create something larger than ourselves and, in turn, create a positive impact on the planet is exactly what the Co-Active Network was created to support. And this is what only two niches are touching. There’s so much more. Wow! My heart is full and I’m very proud to be sitting here in this seat where my bum rests. I’m watching. I see you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</span> <span style="padding: 0 10 0 38"></span>

An inspiring <a href="#musings" class="orange">Member Musing</a> from an 18-year-old young woman (who must be 19 by now) shares the impact coaching has had on her. Then, please take the time to read closely the <a href="#support" class="orange">Network Support Wizardry</a> article, as I create a new policy for the Public Discussions and much more! Our “Abby” of the coaching world, Judith Cohen, MCC, comes next to share her expertise with us in <a href="#ask" class="orange">Ask Judith</a>.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“Naturally creative.” What does that mean? Both words have their roots in the same meaning. “Nature” comes from nasci, meaning “to be born.” “Create” comes from creare, meaning “to make, produce, arise, grow.”
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In practical terms, it means that creativity isn’t reserved for the artist. In fact, creativity is your natural state of being. You’re creating every second of every day, even when you don’t feel it. You need only look at your nighttime dreams for proof: what could be more creative than to turn off your body and mind and still make a fantastic movie, even if you’re the only audience member.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">ANY services or products that are offered on the Co-Active Network, free of charge or for a fee, belong in the <b>PROMOs</b> thread. Do not start a new “promo or promos” thread. Go to the existing thread and post from there. Some examples of promotional posts would be: Free Info Call, I Need Clients for Certification, I Build Websites, I Have Free ‘Stuff’ For You, Sign Up for…you get the idea. We’ll learn as we go. Thank you to everyone who posts so diligently to the thread. Am I missing anything?
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For now, the only exception I see, is course participants looking for homework clients. These can still be posted separately.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Responding to a discussion</b> can create an unintended impact. For example, all the “add me to the list” replies end up going to 6,000+ people. If someone is compiling a list of interested members, please send the originator an email separately.

    <p>Dear R.E.: <br>
      Retirement is a specific rite of passage whose meaning has shifted a great deal in the last century. Due to medical, social and personal advances, most people who reach the traditional age of retirement are in good mental and physical health and have many productive years ahead of them. Many Baby Boomers have had successful work lives and thus have the means to enjoy a fulfilling retirement. It is likely that many people who have the financial ability will opt for voluntary early retirement, such as your client has chosen.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">What is coaching? What is therapy? How are they different? How are they alike? Where do they overlap and where do the domains remain distinctly different? We will have a lively conversation about the distinctions between coaching and therapy and more. This call is for you if you are curious about the distinctions between coaching and therapy. This call is also for you if you have strong opinions about the distinctions between coaching and therapy. Join Samuel P.B.

Prior experience includes extensive training as a psychotherapist, where Sam maintained a successful private practice for many years, while also working in inpatient psychiatric settings and outpatient clinic settings as a clinician, supervisor and director.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Hi Chicago coaches, my Certification exam is history! Many of you have completed your certification or are following other coaching paths. Whatever your perspective, it's time for a Chicago get-together in the western suburbs. Let's meet each other again or for the first time. There is no agenda here except to stay connected and CELEBRATE coaching. Feel free to bring something yummy to share or just bring your curiosity. I'll have lots of beverages! Jean Bruno, Elmhurst, IL.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">There are several professional coaches residing in the southwest corner of Chicago-land who have expressed interest in creating a coaching network that does not require traveling long distances through heavy traffic to attend a coaching event. Many coaches work full-time positions and coach evening hours, thus not allowing them to attend some of the great programs offered by ICF and CTI groups. Therefore, we are attempting to address this issue by creating a space that is more conducive to location, day and time.
