	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hello Co-Activators and Colleagues,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What a glorious season this has become. I find myself receiving the many gifts from this community and beyond. With all these gifts comes great learning. I am reminded daily of how important it is to be able to meet <i>what is</i> right in front of me, be able to then blend with it and then point it. This year's Leader Days (faculty training) delved in to the many facets of this concept. I'm pointing you "there" as it's my theme for this month's <i>Co-Active Network News</i>.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I was presented this month with two articles&mdash;our featured articles this month from the Fatherhood niche and our Geographic community, the European Co-Active Community. I chose to meet them right where they are. No editing. And I want to point us to look at the wonderful perspectives they bring…the inclusion of <i>what is</i>. After all, in relationships, we must embrace all that is, even if it is not rosy all of the time. If we're going to be in relationship using the Co-Active Network, isn't it grand that we acknowledge and embrace all that is here? All that we are? I know the answer is YES.

It's carried back to Europe to spread light, comfort and companionship in the Old World.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Perhaps it's time not just to ship the tea, but to take the tea bushes and transplant them from one continent to another. We old Europeans want to brew a warming cup of Co-Active tea for everyone, and we now need more than just the excellent teabags that come on ships from America.

At some point, I asked my client to describe his ideal day. It consisted of the pursuit of a variety of leisure interests. Although he is in the process of changing the direction of his business into a new and, as he described it, more exciting direction, work did not feature in his ideal day.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When I reflected this to him, he said, "No, would yours?" Well, actually, mine would.  After all, we work for long enough, so why shouldn't it get us into our fullest energy?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Later that day, I happened to be typing the phrase "work/life balance" and stopped to think about it a little more. Suddenly the phrase seemed loaded in that it implies that a fulfilled life somehow cannot include work. Work is, after all, a part of life, although for many it keeps them away from family and leisure pursuits.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When we almost automatically talk of work/life balance, are we unconsciously bringing in an assumption that "work" and "life" are to be kept separate?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I may feel like King Canute down at the beach, but from now on I shall be using the term "work/leisure balance." Anyone want to join me before my feet get wet?

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Thanks to all of you who sent me these tidbits and requests. Please feel free to keep sending them. As we work toward the future with upgrades and enhancements, it is the now that must be served. So here we go!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Responding to Discussions</b><br>As a friendly reminder, please be sure to copy the text you wish to reply to or that you're referencing. If you have managed your account to receive digests, simply replying to an email in a digest will forward a list longer than Santa Claus gets in December. Please make it useful and to-the-point for the receivers.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Also, good to keep in mind that if you're responding to a discussion, is it really keeping that particular thread active and alive or did you just start a new one? Hmmm.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Private/Public Discussions</b><br>As a member of any given community, you will see the Private Discussion link in the left nav bar. (Geek speak for the green shaded margin on the left with all the links in it.)  You will actually see both discussion boards.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a visitor and not a member, you will see only the Public Discussion board. These two different areas are used uniquely by each community, with each deciding their use. Note:  The Main Community has a Public Discussion area only. There is no Private Discussion board there.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Is What I'm Seeing the Truth?</b><br>Caching (pronounced "cashing") is where what you're viewing is actually historical in context. Let me explain. If you do not log out of the system, your page (link) will be cached. Every time I click on the Co-Active Network, I see the Main Community home page with 2,584 members. It's actually, as of this writing, 2,811. I must LOG IN freshly each time I visit the site to see the current live information.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Clean out your cache and cookies and you should start fresh. I do this by having my Internet browser open in front of me, then going to Tools>Internet Options>Delete cookies>Delete files and then I clear history. This will not be an issue when the Network gets its upgrade.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Do You Have a Road Runner Account (rr.com)?</b><br>If you seem not to be getting emails from the Co-Active Network and you have an rr.com account, please know that it's a known issue with RoadRunner; its server-side spam filtering is at fault. About the only thing you can do right now is to sign up with a different email provider. Sounds drastic, and, do it only if you're NOT getting the emails and want to.
