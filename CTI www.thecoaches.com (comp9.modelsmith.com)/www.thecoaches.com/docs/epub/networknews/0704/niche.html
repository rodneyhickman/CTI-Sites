	<td style="padding: 0 30 0 0"><h2><b>Of Birds, Bees…and Coaches </b></h2>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It&rsquo;s everywhere. In  advertising, on the message boards of the Co-Active Network, at the movies, on  magazine racks.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Yup, even at church. Two weeks  ago, I received an oversized postcard from the local evangelical church  announcing in large, bold font above the smiling, boyish face of the local  preacher, who, in my opinion anyway, looks a bit young to be an authority on  such things: &ldquo;God Wants You to Have Great Sex!&rdquo;
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> In the past couple of months,  there have been a number of posts on the Co-Active boards dealing with sex,  sexuality and sexual energies.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> The responses to those posts  have represented voices of warning, gratitude, abandon, danger, creativity,  fear, freedom and more. In other words, they have been all over the map.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> What is it about something as  common as sex, in a community peopled by champions of self-expression and  bearers of the flame of the full range of human experience that leads to such  highly charged reactions?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t know  that I have answers to that question.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> What I&rsquo;m fairly certain of is  that sex, sexuality and the energies that surround, infuse and inform all  things sexual are&mdash;for those interested and willing to part with their comfort  levels, let go of their assumptions and venture beyond the pale of the prurient  and puritanical (and trust the Co-Active Model)&mdash;rich worlds worthy of  exploration on both personal and, as coaches, professional levels.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> It would be na&iuml;ve to say that,  just because human beings procreate sexually and are all the products of sexual  union, there isn&rsquo;t anything to discuss outside mechanics and biological fact. Were  that the case, I could end the article here and go watch TV.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Of course, human sexuality is  far more complex than that.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There is no shortage of confusion  when it comes to sexual issues. In the wake of the women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s movements&mdash;to  say nothing of the Sexual Revolution, the age of HIV/AIDS and an increasingly  embraced (on one level) yet held at arm&rsquo;s length relationship with gay and lesbian  culture on the part of the main-stream (&ldquo;Queer Eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ellen&rdquo; are  entertaining, but is it OK for &ldquo;those&rdquo; people to marry or live next door?)&mdash;we  see and hear more about sex and sexuality than ever before. Still, as a  society, we don&rsquo;t do a very good job of holding it all or engaging in open,  curious conversation on the subjects of sex or sexuality.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> And we are all male or female  sexual beings.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  While that may not be front-page  news, it is very easy to overlook the fact that, as humans, we experience life  in one of two primary ways: either via a male body or a female body. While it  may be politically incorrect to reduce experience to &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female,&rdquo; the  simple fact remains. As men and women, our experiences of the world are not  homogeneous.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Water is wet, rocks are hard,  and men and women see and feel the world differently.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> I would assert that, as  coaches, we do our clients&mdash;male and female&mdash;a huge disservice by assuming that  differences as elemental as gender can be glossed over. Of course, our clients  are human beings, and their &ldquo;human&rdquo; experience is informed, sometimes in subtle  ways, sometimes at high-volume, by whether they look at the world through a  male or female lens!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Our clients have names,  accomplishments, goals, foibles, dreams&hellip;and a specific gender&mdash;all of which are  worthy of honor and attention.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  Does that mean that as a coach,  I can access some sort of formula that frees me from having to be curious or  can serve as a form of pre-determined template for engagement, based on whether  a client is a man or a woman?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Not in the least. If anything,  it means there is even more to be curious about&mdash;at an &ldquo;essence&rdquo; level that most  people don&rsquo;t explore. Gender is such an elemental component of who we are. It&rsquo;s  something so obvious that we are often unconscious as to how much it impacts  and defines our experience. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Another point I would like to  make is that sex and sexuality are not pathologies.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Many people have a difficult  time being in the presence of emotion, and so it is with topics of a sexual nature.  Sex is one of those areas in which an uninformed, largely prudish society has,  paradoxically, made it all but unacceptable not to know. Assuming that people  instinctually know about sex is akin to assuming that the waiter knows what  you&rsquo;ll be ordering for dinner before you&rsquo;ve walked in the door.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Preferences and desires are as  varied as the individuals who have them, yet permission to try new things or  even talk about experimentation can feel like dangerous terrain. Combine that  reticence with shame or guilt and social expectations, and watch the sexual  saboteurs (gremlins) arrive by the bus-load.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  Naturally creative, resourceful  and whole people with a desire to discuss and explore their sexual attractions,  fantasies or nature are not broken. They needn&rsquo;t be ushered off to therapy  simply because they wish to explore their sexuality. (Sexual violence and/or  abuse, physical or otherwise&mdash;as either victim or perpetrator&mdash;is a different  matter entirely.)
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  Not all coaches are comfortable  with sexual issues, and it isn&rsquo;t important that all coaches develop the skills  or curiosity to work with clients in this arena. If you have no interest in  working with clients who bring sexual subjects to the table, make that clear to  your clients when and if the subject comes up, and offer to refer them on.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  Having said the above, if your  own personal beliefs or history make it impossible for you to self-manage, to  see them as naturally creative, resourceful and whole, to deal with a client&rsquo;s  sexuality without judging them or introducing your own agenda into the mix,  notice that. If there is something in you that needs to be healed, by all means  find the appropriate professional and do your work.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Last, and certainly not least,  human beings have&mdash;thank you Carl Jung!&mdash;shadows, and they often hide the best of  themselves in dark places.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  In the years the  Masculine/Feminine/Third Way group has been working together, I continue to be  amazed and moved by the transformations that occur when men and women stop  running from the parts of themselves they have &ldquo;sequestered off-stage in a  sound-proof booth,&rdquo; as the line from the old TV show used to go.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Sexual shadows are often viewed  as frighteningly dark and dangerous. They typically present facades of  overwhelming, uncontrollable force and/or powerless vulnerability. They can be  hidden beneath a client&rsquo;s fear that, should they crack the door just a bit, it  will be thrown open and they will be swallowed.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> To be sure, in a coaching  situation, facing those shadows takes a high level of commitment and  intentionality from both coach and client, and sure-footed and focused levels  of listening, self-management and curiosity on the part of the coach. The  agenda for that level of exploration, of course, comes from the client. I have  yet to see a client walk through the dark and &ldquo;eat&rdquo; their shadow&mdash;sexual or  otherwise&mdash;who has not come out the other side intact and, in fact, stronger,  more present, alive and fulfilled as a result.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  There is, of course, much more  to be said about sex, sexuality, sexual energy and coaching than we have room  for here.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> The bottom line is that sex is  and will remain a normal, healthy component of human life and relationships so  long as we continue to walk the Earth. As with every other aspect of the human  experience&mdash;male or female&mdash;questions will arise, concerns will surface and a  multitude of perspectives will be generated.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> If I could offer just one piece  of advice in the arena of working with sexuality, it is this: lean into the  Co-Active model for, as with human sexuality, there is much to learn there.
