	<p><i>Dear  Judith:</i><br>
        <i>I have  had a couple of clients over the last few years who don't like to come to a  coaching call in what I will call a &quot;messy&quot; or incomplete state. They  prefer to come to the call and report about what they have accomplished, and  have deferred our regular call to a later time so they are more  &quot;prepared.&quot; I've tried to discourage them from doing so, because they  weren't really doing the things they said they most wanted to accomplish in a  timely fashion. And they were not making a dent in what they referred to as  their &ldquo;lack of discipline.&rdquo; These same clients have often resisted when I've  suggested accountabilities or that we together set up some goals. As an  experienced coach, I've explained the benefits of regular appointments and  talking over what might have come up to deflect them from their goals, alas to  no avail. I'd love some guidance!</i><br>
        <i>&mdash;S.B.</i></p>
	<p>Dear  S.B.:<br>
	  As a  former client of just that type, I can relate to both of your predicaments. I  know in my own situation, I had a very powerful streak of perfectionism that  was dictating my behavior. Although I never deferred any of my sessions, I used  to dread showing up when I hadn&rsquo;t completed my homework assignment. It was hard  for me to imagine that my coach would still like me if I didn&rsquo;t complete things  on time.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is  very important that you and your client clearly understand what both of your  roles are in the coaching relationship. Discussing your designed alliance is  essential. What does your client see your role to be in this relationship? What  do you see your role to be? It will be helpful to reiterate how a Co-Active  coaching relationship works. Co-Active coaching is most powerful when it is not  only used to report steps taken (or not taken) toward achieving goals but also  to discuss feelings about what clients want in their lives. Your effectiveness  lives in your ability to call forth your clients&rsquo; direct experience, as well as  to hold them accountable for what they say they want. Getting clients in touch  with their own feelings and beliefs will be as powerful as any activity that  you can assign as homework.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Speaking  of accountability, many coaches miss the opportunity to fully use the skill of  accountability. Accountability is most often applied to actions to be taken by  clients. There is a whole other level of accountability that should not be  forgotten, which is about holding clients accountable to the fulfillment of  their vision and dreams, making choices that support those visions and dreams  and being present and aware of what they are experiencing in the moment. If one  is not held accountable for the intangibles in life, it becomes that much more  difficult to realize the tangible in the form of actions to be taken by  clients.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here is a  small tip about homework. The most useful homework assignments that I have  given my clients have been co-designed by my clients. It is important that they  take an active part in designing the homework and owning it from its inception.  That way they are more likely to be invested in doing it in a manner that serves  them rather than just doing it to report it to their coach. The more the  homework can be focused on a mix of paying attention to their experience while  they are doing something, the more the learning will be enhanced.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Once you  have discussed and clarified your relationship again, it might be helpful to  explore with your clients what being &ldquo;messy&rdquo; or incomplete means for them. Have  your clients deeply experience the feelings that messy arouses in them. I can  imagine that there might be some shame, embarrassment, realizing that they  really can&rsquo;t do it alone, etc. Not wanting to acknowledge or feel these  powerful feelings can often cause us to produce results that are exactly the  opposite of what we originally intend.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After  this exploration, I would also look at redesigning your alliance with these  clients to specifically include talking about messy or incomplete situations  and the feelings that accompany them. Remind them that blame will not be part  of the conversation and that your only job here is to explore all avenues that  will help them achieve what their hearts desire. If clients are unwilling or  unable to do that, find out what they would be able to do. Perhaps, you can  design an agreement that will last only a month or you could design it around a  goal that is less charged.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">By  agreeing to defer the call until they are &ldquo;more prepared,&rdquo; you are colluding  with a desire that is against their best interest. Rather than deferring the  call, you can use that time to discuss the issues that are causing the client  to want to defer the call. If for some reason, you still choose to defer the  call, it might be helpful to charge them for the missed call. Whether they  realize it or not, they are paying a price by waiting until they have something  to report to you. Charging them will no doubt provoke a conversation and it  will provide the perfect opportunity for you to discuss the above issues with  them.</p>
	<p><i>Dear  Judith:</i><br>
        <i>It is  January again and it is naturally the time of year that people make sweeping  resolutions for the coming year. I often find that by February, people are  upset with themselves for not being able to hold true to their resolutions. Do  you have a suggestion about dealing with this annual let down?</i><br>
        <i>A.K.</i></p>
	<p>Dear  A.K.:<br>
	  I think  it is almost impossible for anyone to make large sweeping changes all at once.  Consequently, we are doomed to failure. A much more proactive approach is to  focus on small changes that will ultimately accrue to form large sweeping  changes. In coaching, we often call this skill &ldquo;chunking down.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Instead  of trying to achieve everything at once, it can be helpful to have a monthly or  weekly focus. For example, if one of the things your clients are interested in  is better health, they may focus on nutrition for the month of January, aerobic  exercise for February, weightlifting in March, etc. By breaking it down, they  can ease into a routine and can become familiar with it. Once the routine feels  familiar and able to be done consistently, they can add a new skill. By eating  healthy meals during the day, they are likely to have more energy and, thus,  can feel motivated by February to start aerobic exercising. By March, they can  add lifting weights, now that they are eating well, getting enough exercise and  have the positive reinforcement of succeeding at their goals. If at any point,  they are overwhelmed, they can just go back a step until they are ready to  progress again.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At the  beginning of each calendar year, I have my clients project what their dreams  and visions are for the coming year. I also ask them what is important about  that for them and how this will honor them. I have found that it is important  to attach goals to the experience of fulfillment or there is no motivation to  achieve them. Some clients then find it extremely helpful to break the year  down into 12 focus areas and then assign actions to be taken by focus. A focus  can either be a section of the Wheel of Life or it can be a type of activity or  a way of being that involves all of the sections. The only important point is  that it will enable clients to fulfill their vision for the coming year.</p>
	      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are  all capable of taking little steps. When done with the intention of supporting  our life dreams and desires, those little steps have quantum reverberations.  Here&rsquo;s my 2006 resolution: No sweeping New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions for this year!  You can be sure that this is a resolution that I will keep.</p>
