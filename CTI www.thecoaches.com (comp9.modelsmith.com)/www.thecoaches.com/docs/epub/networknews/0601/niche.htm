      <p><b>Introducing MF3 Coaching: The Masculine, Feminine, </b><b>Third Way</b><b> Coaching Niche</b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0601/images/Niche0601.jpeg" width="136" height="107" hspace="10" align="right">We hold that re-claiming our ever-evolving masculine and  feminine energies is a pathway to wholeness. </b>The more we evoke and express the full range of  masculine and feminine energies, the more we experience and express our core  selves. This full experience and expression contributes to our personal  evolution, as well as to the healing and growth of the world. <b></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The energy of the feminine  and the energy of the masculine are infused in everything, from negative and  positive electrically charged sub-atomic particles to individual men and women,  to whole corporate cultures, not to mention countries and continents.<br>
      What is possible when we fully  honor the core masculine and feminine energies within ourselves and others<i>? </i></p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>This is a cross-gender niche.</b> All of us have at our disposal the  verdant energies of the masculine and the feminine, regardless of gender. Each  of these energies brings with it gifts that are wanted&mdash;and needed&mdash;in the world.  Paradoxically, we often operate from &ldquo;preferred,&rdquo; or societally &ldquo;appropriate,&rdquo;  aspects of these energies while suppressing others.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">        When we speak of the &ldquo;Third Way,&rdquo; we are pointing toward combining  or working with these energies in a fashion that embraces and celebrates the  dynamic tension between them. By developing&nbsp;awareness and deeper  consciousness&nbsp;of both masculine and feminine energies,&nbsp;our clients  experience a fuller sense of themselves and gain access to a wider range of  self-expression.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">        The &quot;Third Way&quot; is not a specific place or a  fixed way of being. It is the capacity to both inhabit and transcend the  duality of the masculine and feminine. It is the capacity to embrace and live  from the center of paradox with consciousness and enjoyment.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Where do we begin?</b> If we are going to look through a &ldquo;Third Way&rdquo; lens while coaching clients, we  need to explore this path for ourselves. We need to ask some questions! For  instance, how does one consciously tap into the life force that lives at the  center of the co-creative dance between masculine and feminine energies? What  are the unconscious&mdash;and conscious&mdash;assumptions we hold as individuals and in the  collective about the feminine and masculine? What impact do those assumptions  have on our relationships&mdash;with ourselves and with others? How do we experience  core feminine and/or masculine energies? What are the many aspects of these  energies? Many of us have limited our expression or suppression of the  masculine and feminine to sexuality; what other expressions of these powerful  energies are available to us? How do they live within us? How do they live  between us?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We begin to  get to know and unleash the true form of these evolving energies by becoming  deeply curious.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">        Part  of our stake is that our very existence as a species counts on us waking up to  new possibilities and acting on them. Consider that the way our internal masculine and feminine  energies relate to one another is a microcosm of how we experience and impact  the world. One path to wholeness and  peace&mdash;personally and for our world&mdash;is through each of us embracing the unique  dance of our own inner feminine and masculine energies, continually finding and  evolving the Third Way that lives at the center of this dynamic paradox. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">        In this niche community, we are building a foundation on which to bring the  work (and PLAY!) of this delicious dance into the world. We invite men and  women alike to join us as we traverse the terrain of masculine and feminine energies and  learn to dance.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There is  great power to be tapped within the feminine and masculine energies that live  within and between us. It&rsquo;s time to play and explore! Will you join us?</p>
