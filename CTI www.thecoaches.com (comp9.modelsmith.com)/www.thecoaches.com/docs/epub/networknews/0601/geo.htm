  <p><b>Louisville </b>(L&#363; &bull;  &#259; &bull; v&ucirc;l) or Looavul, Luhvul, Loueville,  Looaville and Looeyville</p>
  <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0601/images/Vickie0601.jpg" width="92" height="123" hspace="10" align="right">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re a coach&mdash;what sport? Until recently, that was the  usual response to questioning about professional coaching in Louisville.  Louisville, you see, is a hotbed of college basketball&mdash;U of L, UK and IU. If  you happen to be a basketball virgin and don&rsquo;t recognize these legendary teams  or their coaches (Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, Bobby Knight and Denny Crum), then  perhaps you&rsquo;ll recognize other sports names celebrated by our great city:  Muhammad Ali, the Louisville Slugger, the Valhalla Golf Course, Louisville  Extreme (skateboard) Park, and the ever popular, Kentucky Derby. Keeneland is  &ldquo;just down the road&rdquo; in Lexington, and within a two-hour drive from Louisville  are the Cincinnati Reds, the Cincinnati Bengals, the Indianapolis Colts, the  Indiana Pacers and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Today, the coaching profession in Louisville is finding  recognition outside the field of sports. While variations of the nine graduates  of CTI have been gathering at Heine Bros. Coffee shops for the last six years,  a dedicated trio has set out to create a &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; in 2006 about our Coaching  Alliance and the profession of coaching in Louisville. By joining the CTI  network as the newest geographic community, we take our first step in becoming  the premier professional coaching hub of the southeast. As founding members of  the Kentuckiana Coach Alliance, we have been catalysts in the reformation of  our local chapter of the ICF. (Which, by the way, has relocated its  headquarters to Lexington, KY, a mere hour&rsquo;s drive to the east.) <i>Since I&rsquo;ve  been doing a bit of name-dropping, guess what CTI legend is from our neck of  the woods? David Darst and Chuck Roppel are both from Louisville and great  guesses, but not the one I have in mind. Read on to find the answer.</i></p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What better place than Louisville to emerge as the coaching  hub of the southeast? It&rsquo;s  the largest city in Kentucky and the sixteenth largest city in the United  States. Located  on the banks of the Ohio River, Louisville borders southern Indiana, thus the  ICF geographic descriptive, Kentuckiana. Unlike Chicago, St. Louis and  Nashville, located less than 300 miles from here, Louisville has a small town  charm and a lower cost of living, with many of the amenities of the larger  cities. </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Sometimes  called the &ldquo;Gateway to the South,&rdquo; Louisville&rsquo;s way of life represents a  mixture of the South, the Midwest and the Southeast. Our neighborhoods  encompass rich traditions from the Russian,  French, German, Bosnian, Irish, African, Mexican and Vietnamese cultures. We  are part of the Olmstead Park System, hosting three of Frederick Olmstead&rsquo;s  flagship parks.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Other little known  facts about Louisville borrowed from the Louisville Metro website include:</p>

  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So, have you guessed our celebrity CTI coach? While not  from Louisville (she&rsquo;s from &ldquo;down  the road a piece&rdquo;), the ever-charming, effervescent, lovable and legendary  coach is none other than&hellip;Cynthia Loy Darst, CPCC, MCC.</p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We hope you have enjoyed this brief introduction to the  Louisville community and that you will contact us if you or someone you know  comes to our neck of the woods. We&rsquo;d love to show them a bit of Co-Active  Southern hospitality.</p>
