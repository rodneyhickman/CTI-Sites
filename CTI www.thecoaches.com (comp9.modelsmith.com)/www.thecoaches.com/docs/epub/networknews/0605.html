<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In this article, we look at four negative behaviors that happen in relationships. Why learn them? Because as you become more aware of them, you’ll also be better able to consciously stop them.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The four most toxic behaviors to a partnership are: criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling. They are so lethal to a relationship that John Gottman (relationship expert and best-selling author) calls them the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They usually appear in the order below. As you read about them, mull over the way each horseman gallops (or doesn't gallop) into your relationships.

A strong and vibrant community is starting to bloom in Holland (like a beautiful tulip), full of enthusiastic coaches who got acquainted with the Co-Active way of coaching. Here is what an experienced coach had to say after the class: “I am more conscious of my personal behavior in coaching, less serious. I will dance more and rely on my power and skills.” And a woman new to the coaching profession: “All will be different. It is like starting from zero. Through intuition, I will use my heart more and my mind less.”
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Beginning this year, Dance2Move (a company of my business partner Wim Vermaak and me) is bringing the CTI courses to the Netherlands and Belgium. In January and in March, we had a Fundamentals course, and from April through July, the first intermediate series is taking place. After the summer, the second series is planned.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Netherlands has a number of coaching schools, as do most countries in the world. However, Co-Active coaching is the first ICF-accredited, in-person coach education to be offered here, and, of course, we are very proud of that.

	    Send a new message to the community email address. You can  get this email address from the &quot;About This Community&quot; page. Note  that only messages sent from the same email account you are registered with  will be accepted.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b>How do I post a new message?</b><br>
	    Click on an existing discussion. To post a new message,  either scroll down to the bottom of the page in a discussion or click the  &quot;Post a Message&quot; button in the toolbar to go there.

	  <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b>How can I delete or edit a message I posted?</b><br>
	    To edit or delete a message, click the &quot;Edit&quot; or  &quot;Delete&quot; buttons next to your post.

Use the &quot;Edit&quot; button to correct errors rather than using the  &quot;Back&quot; button in your browser. If you use the &quot;Back&quot; button,  your comment will be posted twice instead of edited. It's possible to delete a  post at any time if you're a registered user.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b>Why are my messages being rejected when I reply to  discussions over email?</b><br>
	    You must send emails from the same email account that you  used to register on the Co-Active Network. Also, if you are replying to an  existing discussion, make sure that your subject line matches exactly the name  of the discussion. </p>

Not only am I horrified at  facing such a monumental loss, I also find myself angry with my clients who  seem to have minor problems in comparison to what my husband is going through  now. Most of the time, I can hardly concentrate on what my clients are saying  because I feel like I am wasting precious moments that I could be spending with  my husband. Do you have any thoughts on how to work when you are faced with a  life and death situation in your own life? </i><br>
      <i>&mdash;A.A. </i></p>
    <p>Dear A.A.: <br>
I am so sorry to hear about your husband. I can only imagine  how hard this time must be for you. It sounds like the most important thing  that you can do for your clients is to be honest with yourself about what your  own needs are right now. Naturally, it&rsquo;s hard for you to separate yourself from  your own current experience. This is perfectly understandable, given how recent  and shocking this news has been. I imagine that you are putting a lot of energy  into self-managing around your clients. Given your current circumstances, I  wonder whether this is actually beneficial for you. I also wonder whether your  clients are consciously or unconsciously picking up on your anger, despite your  best efforts to self-manage.

	    <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Anita and I are thrilled to introduce you to this month's guest speaker: Andreas Buergi of Switzerland. The Hendricks call in April was a perfect segue for Andreas’ topic: stressing to learn. As coaches, we are always thinking that we never know enough, that if we learned one more thing it would make us brilliant (or at the very least more capable). Well, Andreas is here to talk to us about using all the tools we already have—OURSELF (our best tool), coming from the heart, using our gut and following our intuition. In Europe, they have Systemic Coaching—holograms, profile assessments and wheels. Andreas will give us more, more, more—the European way! Anita Costa, CPCC, and Kathy Hay, CPCC, are hosts.
