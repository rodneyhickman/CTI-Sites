	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0705/geo07-w.jpg" width="90" height="125" align="right">Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is an eclectic city that attracts people from all over the globe, and the diversity is such that one wonders how it can all work. Somehow it does, and Co-Activity is truly at home in a place that needs every way to cross borders, political and religious views. Where everything seems built to dwarf what is already in Las Vegas, Co-Activity seems to fit the part of not only the glue that holds it all together but also the tool for going forward.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On May 30, it will be exactly two years since PF Interaction Coaching & Development started offering CTI courses in Dubai. More than a hundred people have participated in the courses, and we have seen people go through Certification and Leadership all in the name of Co-Activity in the region.</p>

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The reach of CTI stretches across an amazing array of personalities, nationalities, religions and cultures. Leaders never cease to be amazed by the sheer variety present in all the Dubai-based courses. We often ask ourselves why the world is the way it is when we look at the diversity and harmony in the room. To further that multiplicity and regional development, we have the vision of translating the CTI material to Arabic and developing Arab leaders to join the CTI faculty.</p>

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are excited about the future of Co-Activity throughout the Gulf countries and we really look forward to continuing to play a part in the development of this part of the world for the sake of bringing the world closer together.</p>
