	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0706/niche-w.jpg" width="86" height="108" align="right">If you are like today’s retirees, you are healthy, energetic, educated and curious—and you want it all! From the adventure travel to the uber-spiritual experience, the classic cooking lessons in Tuscany to the hobby-turned-business in the basement, you and your fellow Boomers now retiring are in search of a multi-dimensional lifestyle.	  </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Can this lifestyle become your reality? Yes, it can, and there are two major components: your work and your relationships. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	 Your work? I thought I was done with work! Like your retiring colleagues, you have professional skills and training, and you have invested a large part of your life in your work. When you retire, the most comfortable situation is for you to maintain some kind of work function. Work has played such a major part of your adult years that it is important to create something that is or feels like work, in order to retain that sense of vigor and connection with life. The possibilities are numerous: trying something quite new, following a dream career, starting your own business, deciding to write or paint, volunteering overseas. Retirement offers a fresh chance to work at something special. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  Many people like you now leaving the workplace have 30+ years of retired life ahead of them, and you will choose to design a new work style that suits your particular needs. For many, work will supplement that hard-earned pension income and relieve the fear that your money will run out before you do. The many options include part-time work, choosing to undertake specific projects, seasonal initiatives or consulting. Employers are realizing that the characteristics embodied in you mature workers, such as a strong work ethic and loyalty, are hard to replace, and they are ready to negotiate customized work contracts. This way, the corporate world is able to retain skilled people who have proven to be honest and reliable.  </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  This flexible work style offers you retired people a chance to contribute in many ways; you can keep a hand in, enjoy the social and professional benefits of a working environment, and still have time to travel and volunteer in ways that have special meaning for you. It is a win/win for employers and retirees. The workplace benefits from the wisdom and experience of its retired members, and the retirees—that’s you—benefit from having the need to maintain a work function in their lives fulfilled.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Your relationships? As in this revised concept of work, you current retirees will also change the nature of your relationships. Yes, you have put a major part of your life into your work; yes, you have also raised a family, nurtured friends and family relations; and yes, you have tried to make time for your significant other. But once you retire, all these relationships change dramatically! </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  First, leaving your prime workplace initiates strong feelings of loss. Loss of the social environment you were immersed in every day. Loss of the title, role and responsibilities you have had for decades. You may feel useless and discarded, as though you are no longer of value. This feeling is quite normal! Your working relationships have changed and they will never be the same. Decide which of your colleagues you want to retain as friends and make an effort to develop those friendships. Allow other, more casual, fellow workers to drift from your life, maybe seeing them on occasion. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Now, find that replacement for the function of work we talked about earlier and create something in your life that has meaning for you. Remember, you are who you are, not what you do. You will now be the person you want to be and your relationships will be those you want to have.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  If personal relationships need changing, this is the perfect time to make these changes. If you have been in a pattern for years that you are unhappy with, this is the opportunity to explain to others involved that you are creating a new life and that from now on this is how you wish to conduct this relationship. Be firm, be clear and you will design a new relationship that honors both of you. Let boring and unsatisfying relationships go; create new and meaningful ones!</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  Unfortunately, your marriage or primary relationship is one that may suffer at this time of your life. Statistics show that the divorce rate has doubled in the last 10 years for couples over 55 years of age. The reasons are many, but most have to do with the fact that you and your significant other are now spending a lot more time together than you have in many a year. Some couples realize that they do not enjoy each other’s company as much as they once did and are not prepared to stay in an unfulfilling relationship. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  Seek counseling if you need to and spend some time looking at what will work for you and your spouse. You each need time alone to follow through on your own work replacement activities. You each need time to be alone or with personally selected friends and family members. You need focused time together when you work on your marriage, your mutual interests and newly developing plans for the 30+ years ahead. Through caring and action, you can create a warm, flexible and trusting relationship that allows each of you the joy of personal freedom, as well as the fulfillment of a loving and supportive relationship together.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  So, yes, when you retire, you CAN have the world. Once you put the pieces of your retirement lifestyle plan into place and you take action in line with your plan, you can, maybe for the first time in your life, find fulfilling work and manage successful relationships. Having the world means caring for your own needs, those of your spouse and family members and those of the community in which you belong. It is a win/win and it is working for millions!</p>
