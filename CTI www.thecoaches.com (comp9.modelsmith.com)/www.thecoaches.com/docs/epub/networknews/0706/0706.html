Many of you have graduates completing a significant cycle. And new cycles are beginning. Ah, what lies ahead during the summer months? Be sure to plan some spaciousness into your lives. Recharge some of your batteries—and I don’t mean your electronics. Plan joy and recreation into your summer schedule. Have those conversations with your loved ones and special friends about what is possible this summer. I know I will.

Somehow it does, and Co-Activity is truly at home in a place that needs every way to cross borders, political and religious views. Where everything seems built to dwarf what is already in Las Vegas, Co-Activity seems to fit the part of not only the glue that holds it all together but also the tool for going forward.

When he is under pressure at work, he has a very short fuse and can frequently blow up at the people he manages. Because his company is presently downsizing, he and everyone else in his unit are particularly tense. As you can imagine, the frequency of his explosions is increasing. Do you have any suggestions that will help my client better control his temper? </em></p>
    <p><em>&mdash;M.B.</em>    </p>
    <p>Dear M.B.:<br>
      I’m not sure that “control” is the best description of what you are seeking. I’m more inclined to help your client foster awareness about his patterns of inappropriate expression of anger. Having your client notice his behavior under pressure is far more likely to evoke a different response than merely controlling his anger. Once he has awareness, then he can make informed decisions about what action he wants to take in each specific anger-provoking situation.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">A goal is an outcome that the client would like to achieve. Goals are most helpful when they are measurable, specific, are owned by the client, have a date by which they will be accomplished, are made public (in order to achieve support and accountability), and constitute a reasonable stretch for the client.      
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, are in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or have been doing this for years and would like a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Last month, we heard about six simple and powerful steps to selling effectively and comfortably from Carol Costello, author of The Soul of Selling: How to Achieve Extraordinary Results with Remarkable Ease. We hope that you have obtained her book and begun to practice the steps. This month, we would like to share our in-the-moment learning. What is working and where are we continuing to be stuck? What are we learning about ourselves as we engage in this process to build new relationships with the people in organizations that we want to have as clients? How are you experiencing the selling process from Carol’s perspective? Let’s come together around this approach and see where it goes. If you haven’t obtained her book yet, we encourage you to do so either through Amazon.com or directly from her if you want an autographed copy: <a href="http://www.soulofselling.com" class="orange">www.soulofselling.com</a>. <http://www.soulofselling.com> Even if you haven't read her book, we are sure you will enjoy this discussion.
