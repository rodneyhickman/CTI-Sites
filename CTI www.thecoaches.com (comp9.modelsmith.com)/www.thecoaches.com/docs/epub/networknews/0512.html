I  experienced some personal trepidation at &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; to the whole coaching  community. I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was the right person to lead the GLBT  community&mdash;what do I know? Who am I to be a leader of this community? I don&rsquo;t  even have &ldquo;gaydar&rdquo;&mdash;that inner radar that tells you when someone else is gay. People  have to come out to me over and over&mdash;and usually I need my partner to tell me  that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m part of the family&rdquo; or something similar doesn&rsquo;t just mean they are  friendly. That said, I have been learning something new. I am new at  Co-Actively &ldquo;leading&rdquo; a community. I am new to being out on the Internet. I ask  myself constantly, &ldquo;What is important for the queer community in Co-Active  space?&rdquo; But today I am pondering what is important for the Co-Active community  about queer space?

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Let's consider how much we might learn from the unexpected reactions to  coaching that we can be sure to receive if we work with French people. Most  likely, we'll be asked to clarify concepts and principles abstractly, but more  directly and succinctly than we might be used to. The French mind-set is very Cartesian,  that is, logical and linear thinking are idealized...and people are judged by  their ability to explain themselves using &quot;le mot juste,&quot; the right  word that exactly fits the occasion. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> This said, the exact mapping and translation of terms is exactly what you want  to withhold from your French clients. They want to understand concepts so that  they can judge whether they like them or don't like them: whether they make  sense to them or not, based on previously lived (or secondary and interpreted)  experience.
