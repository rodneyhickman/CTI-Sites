This is definitely a time when many go “inside” and commune with nature and family, and travel to destinations that fill one’s heart. A spacious time for most. I make this up because of the small number of community events that our communities have posted. However, our discussion boards have been active and thriving. We’re getting ready for a busy “back to school” season that is soon upon us. Everyone, take time right now to take a wonderful, grounding, deep breath, relax into the beauty of your summer—wherever it is and however it looks. - - - - - - -  - - - - - -Isn’t that sweet?

What is it, exactly (besides one of the contexts of Co-Active coaching)? It’s subtle and nebulous. Intuition functions in a quantum leap. It occurs where nothing existed before. There is no methodological procedure. There is simply knowing…from nothing.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It comes in several forms. Some people see it. Some people hear it. Others just know it or feel it somewhere in their body. It comes in thoughtlessness, not in figuring it out. It comes in love, not in fear. It’s a knowing that bubbles up from the gut, not one that pushes down from the head. It comes where there is neither judgment nor criticism. When we go to a place of love and openness, intuition spontaneously arrives. It shows up in people, animals, nature and “coincidences.” It’s always there, waiting for us to notice it.

The grand old tree provides nuts, shade and eventually great wood for furniture. But it takes such a long time to mature that you’ve long lost your teeth by the time the first nuts are ready for cracking. In the meantime, it can be a lot of fun watching the sapling sprout, broaden and reach towards the sun. Co-Activity in Europe feels a little like that at present. Our transatlantic sapling is beginning to add shoots and branches. 
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So far we’ve held four community days. They’re non-profit days organised by volunteers from the Co-Active coaching community for the sake of building a network of effective and prosperous coaches. The next community day promises to be the biggest yet. We’re meeting in London on Friday, October 14, and the star attraction is a three-hour workshop run by Marita Fridjhon and Faith Fuller, the founders of Organisational & Relationship Systems Coaching. It will be a marvellous opportunity to sample a powerful way of coaching, both for individuals and in companies. Some of us were lucky enough to have a sneak preview at the International Coach Federation conference in Norway. Marita and Faith are bringing their full programme to Europe. Another great branch on our growing walnut tree!.

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Political coaches are not pollsters, consultants or strategists zeroing in on the next election plan. Rather, nonpartisan political coaches have a one-on-one relationship with a political candidate or elected official that equips them with the personal tools and knowledge to clarify and manifest their vision for their time in public office.

Have you taken the time to fully inform us about you? Have you asked for help in getting your wonderful photo on-line? If you’ve taken a CTI course, you will have the option for the extended profile. If you’re a CPCC, your profile will be used for the Find-A-Coach feature. After you login to the Co-Active Network, click the “Edit Profile” link in the left margin and take the time to see if it’s updated and just the way you want it. For your photos, please make sure they’re 125 pixels tall and 100 pixels wide and that they do not exceed 40K. We’d love to see who you are. It creates a sense of closeness and connection in the virtual world.

    <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget us!<br>
    </strong>When you&rsquo;re away from your office and you set your auto responder on, don&rsquo;t forget about the Co-Active Network and the extra step needed to prevent bounce backs from our site. Before you leave, please go to &ldquo;Manage Account&rdquo; and select &ldquo;no mail&rdquo; and save your changes. Then when you return and shut your auto responder off, visit us right away to set your account to begin receiving emails once again. We&rsquo;ve had a burst of auto replies hit our in-boxes, and I attribute this to the summer months. Please create a structure for yourself to remember so the wizard doesn&rsquo;t have to magically change your account. Poof!</p>

	  <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear S.B.:
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While it appears that successful marketers often appeal to prospective clients’ pains, the whole point is to remove their pain not to create it. I try to set up the sample session as just that, a sample of what coaching is going to be like with me. Most new coaches frequently stand in the perspective that the client is interviewing them. However, I use the sample session as an opportunity to see whether I want to work with this prospective client. When I first started out, I would try to make myself into whatever I thought my client wanted. That often led to being hired by people with whom I really didn’t feel all that comfortable. It was no surprise that many of these people left as I became more authentic.
