Hello Everyone,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What a colorful season on many fronts. Yes, we even have colorful leaves in Northern California—of course, not the display in some regions, and quite lovely nonetheless, especially here in San Rafael. Speaking of colorful, the ICF Conference is in full swing as you read this. This annual event connects many colorful souls. I’m happy to be in the middle of it at the CTI booth. If you’ve ever been to a conference and have come by our booth, you may have experienced a flurry of connection.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This month, we have articles from the Social Action <a href="#niche" class="orange">niche</a> and the newly formed South Africa <a href="#geography" class="orange">geographic</a> community. The infamous Morgana Rae, CPCC, shares a wonderful <a href="#musings" class="orange">Member Musing</a>, and then I share some technical how-to’s and reminders in the <a href="#support" class="orange">Support</a> column. Judith Cohen shares her wisdom in the <a href="#ask" class="orange">Ask Judith</a> section, and we complete with the <a href="#calendar" class="orange">calendar</a> of events that are currently scheduled. As events are added ongoingly, please be sure to visit often to see what has been published.

      <p><b>What is Social Action Coaching?</b><br>
        by Ann V. Deaton, PhD, ACC, Social Action niche co-organizer</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0611/niche.jpg" width="108" height="134" hspace="10" align="right">In the Co-Active Network, many find their calling in one or more of the niche communities. Social Action Coaching is a focus that calls out to many coaches, and the community is an energetic, supportive and creative one. While the label “social action coaching” sounds specific, the experiences of its coaches are anything but. Social action coaching includes coaching in the schools, with clergy, in nonprofit organizations, around issues affecting the environment, in prisons and with elected officials. It’s coaching that builds and maintains the health of individuals and of communities. It’s one person making a difference. In other words, it’s coaching.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A week in the Social Action Coaching niche community might find you participating in some of our calls on a shared bridgeline. You could attend a Mastermind call, during which coaches commit to a wide array of actions, from creating a spirituality website to developing a coaching group for nonprofit leaders. The next week could just as easily find you on a call focusing on “conversations that matter,” facilitated by Joy Martina and based on some of Margaret Wheatley’s work.

        </b><br>
        I was a geek in grade school. I was that nerdy girl wearing the polyester "floods" from Pic ’n Save. I kept my nose in books like <i>Jane Eyre</i> or <i>Lord of the Rings.</i> Small talk baffled me. Then, in the sixth grade, two popular girls adopted me. They took me to the mall and taught me how to dress, became my friends and included me in their activities. Soon I was learning how to make friends and flirt and hold my own with the "cool" kids (politically active, articulate, popular, musically hip) I admired. What happened? These two girls pulled me up to their level of social finesse by association. And these girls were great people—smart, socially aware, responsible and compassionate human beings. People I admire to this day. Our values meshed. And they knew something I needed to learn about social rapport.

       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have a few items to share to ensure a smooth experience both for the givers and the receivers of activity on the Co-Active Network.
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Ever click on an email and it says it can’t be found?</b> This is the result of it not being created in the proper location and thus being moved to its correct location. It might be in the PROMO’s thread. If you want the full impact of your posts, please make sure that they are sourced from the correct location. And a friendly reminder that anyone wanting a coach or offering coaching belongs in the PROMO’s thread. Of course, there are many other types of promotional emails that belong there as well. With so many new members, I’m certain that this is new information for you. Welcome!
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Replying to discussions?</b> Please be sure to use the new reply links at the bottom of each post and not your email “reply” feature in your personal tool bar. Using your personal reply feature instead of the links provided creates a lengthy email with all the content of your digest that creates a negative experience for many members. Thank you in advance for the extra care in helping us create a wonderful user experience for the Co-Active Network.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Have you taken a CTI course?</b> If so, you are eligible to have an extended profile on the Co-Active Network. Be sure to tell us all about yourself and include that lovely smiling picture as well.

    <p>Dear D.M.: <br>
Thanks for your kind words about my column. Rather than brainstorm appropriate responses with you, let’s look at how you might maximize your results in doing sample sessions and at listening to what the client is really asking of you in each of these situations. To do this, you must come from curiosity in both cases.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">What will reclaim time for you to think? What areas of your life and work crave reflection, expansion, focus and co-activity? Please join our discussion of these questions as we engage in a conversation that matters. Curious to see what unravels, opens up, rumbles and shifts as a result? Your insights are valuable. For it is in conversation that we connect, honor, create and change ourselves and one another....thus changing the world.
