You provide that pulse, and it’s full of life in all of its perspectives.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In the beginning, there floated an amorphous space. At the edges of this furry zone, individual notes of flutes, cellos and drums chimed in. The rub of pastel crayons and pen against thick artist’s paper spoke of an itch that wanted to be scratched. The cadence of voices in an improv troupe and the clicking of fingers against keyboards signaled for connection. Creativity was happening, but a greater call was being made.
	    more than 300 inspired students have gone through the various CTI training courses! A lot of us felt this was so good and needed to have more, so we signed up for CTI&rsquo;s certification program. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CPCCs Kathy Loh and Robin Jones heard the rhythm and noticed that the empty space between the arts and the coaching communities cried out for leadership. Colleagues in the BDP, Kathy and Robin recognized each other as fellow creative tribe members. Together, they launched the Coaching Artists niche, which after a year is going strong with 120-plus members. This dynamic niche holds a powerful stake.

Recognizing that promoting the benefits of organizational coaching helps raise the profile of the coaching profession, our local ICF chapter has embraced the Prism Award and is gearing up to present it later this month.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Prism Award celebrates businesses and organizations that have effectively used coaching as a leadership strategy to achieve tangible bottom-line results and other organizational impacts. Initially conceived by the ICF-Greater Toronto chapter five years ago, it’s become an annual event there and a prestigious accolade of business and organizational excellence. It was picked up by the Calgary ICF chapter last year, and now Vancouver is the third Canadian chapter to get on board.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">I know that most all of you have read this information before, and it’s one of those topics that simply can’t be reviewed too much. I’m talking about the etiquette for participation on phone events. I know you know this, unless you don’t, AND, please refresh your memory for yourself and possibly for others. I’ve definitely learned some new things today. I’ve gathered some points from Seek Solutions, one of the providers for CTI’s bridgelines. Thanks Shannon!</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong> TIPS FOR CALLERS</strong>
	<blockquote>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 5 0">• Be prepared to use *6 to mute, and *6 to unmute.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0">• Please call at the exact time scheduled. Calling early may interrupt another group's call. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0">• If you have music on hold, don't put the call on hold. Other callers will hear your music until you return. Hang up, call back.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0">•	If you are using a calling card, be sure to have enough minutes. The "time is about to expire" warning will be heard by the others.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0">• This dial-in number is a special number. Call only during your scheduled time, as it may be in use by other parties at other times. </p>
	  </blockquote>	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong>ECHOES</strong><br>
	  <strong>Cause: </strong>Long-distance connection in most cases. Other possibilities: Speaker phones, head sets, cell phones, VOIP (Internet phoning).
	<p style="margin: 10 0 5 0"><strong>Basic Correction Methods
	</strong>
	<blockquote>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0">• If the echo started when a certain caller joined, have that person call back, or mute using *6 (unmute *6 to speak). </p>
	  <p style="margin: 5 0 5 0"> • If it is unknown who brought the echo, have everyone mute until it disappears. </p>
	  </blockquote>	
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong>STATIC, TALKING IN BACKGROUND, CLICKING NOISES, CUTTING OUT</strong><br>
	    <strong>Probable causes</strong>: Computer/Internet-based dial-up with too little bandwidth (VOIP); satellite connections; cell, speaker, cordless phones; a headset that needs batteries; headsets; faulty wiring.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">	<strong> A SPEAKER OR PARTICIPANT SOUNDS LOW, FUZZY, IN A TUNNEL</strong><br>Make sure anyone who must be heard is using equipment that delivers clear sound. The bridge will not equalize the sound from participants. It will also not discriminate against any particular caller—i.e., cause one person to sound great and another to sound low. It delivers the sound you give it.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong>  Probable Cause </strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 5 0">• User's headset needs fresh batteries, if it takes batteries. </p>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 5 0">• User's headset is of poor quality or needs replacement. </p>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 5 0">• User is on a cordless phone, cell phone or unreliable phone. </p>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 5 0">• User got a bad connection into the bridge (call back). </p> </blockquote>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong>OTHER ERRORS</strong><br>Warning Message: During your call, you hear your "time is up." This is from a calling card. We do not have automated warnings.
