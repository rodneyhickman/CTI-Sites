	  <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have news! The Co-Active Network will now be managed from the CTI office once again. What’s this you say? Hasn’t it been? Well, you see, I’ve had the privilege of being able to work on the Network remotely from my new home in Maui since February of this year. With all the wonderful new CTI initiatives and growth, it makes sense for the Co-Active Network to be sourced from headquarters. However, I will not be returning back to the mainland to support it. I’ve accomplished a dream of many years to live in Hawaii and am pleased to call it my new home.

     <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For starters, the law of attraction explains how it is that we can create the lives we desire, while coaches support their clients in creating the life they desire.  
     <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Secondly, they’ve both gained recognition in the mainstream over the past 10 years and even more so in the past couple of years, yet both have existed for much longer.

August is a very popular month for many to take a holiday. Many cultures use August as their vacation month and close completely. Before you go, visit “manage account” and simply check that “no mail” box and SAVE your changes to that page. Remember to create a structure for yourself to reset your accounts back to normal upon return.

	<p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Also, a reminder to always use <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> for any assistance you may need.

Usually, it has a positive effect. However, my newest client is really put off by the question. She sees no point in yearning for anything because she “knows” her yearning won’t be fulfilled. To look at what she yearns for will just be a waste of time, according to her. Do you have any suggestions for dealing with this issue?</em></p>

     The word “yearn” may have some negative associations for your client. Often people have a sense of melancholy when speaking of their yearning. While you may think of it in positive terms, if your client has a negative reaction to the word, it is important for you to be flexible and find other terminology that will suit your client. What other words elicit the same feelings for you? I can think of several alternative ways of saying the same thing, such as: “What do you most want?” “If you could have your dream come true, what would it look like?” “When you look into the future and you see yourself totally fulfilled, what will you be doing?” I’m sure that you can think of several more ways to discuss yearning, as well.

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This term refers to a powerful question given at the end of the session that is intended to deepen the client’s learning and provoke further reflection. The intention is for the client to consider the inquiry between sessions and to see what occurs for him or her. The inquiry is usually based on a particular situation the client is currently addressing.
“What are you tolerating?” “What is it to be undauntable?” “What is challenge?”
      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, are in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or have been doing this for years and would like a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you.

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">On occasion, the coach may need to intrude, to interrupt or wake up clients who are going on and on or who are kidding themselves. The coach does this for the sake of the client’s agenda, often pointing the client in a specific direction: “Stop a moment. What’s at the heart of this?”
      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Intrusion is considered rude in some cultures. In Co-Active training, however, intrusion is viewed as being direct with the client, allowing the client to honestly assess and immediately deal with the situation. Sometimes the intrusion is a hard truth, such as, “You are kidding yourself.” Or the intrusion could simply be a statement about what is going on, such as, “You’re skirting the issue.”
      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, are in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or have been doing this for years and would like a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you.      </td>
