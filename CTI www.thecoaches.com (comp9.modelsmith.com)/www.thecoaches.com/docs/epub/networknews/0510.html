	<p>Dear Community,</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s becoming time to bring out the cornucopia this harvest season and acknowledge the myriad of talents, passions, love and expertise that make up its contents in our community.</p>
	<p>The efforts coming out of the greater coaching community both near and far to aid the victims of Katrina is a testament to our love for each other. The start-up of the newly forming Rainbow Pride Co-Active Coaches Niche Community is a testament to the passion we hold for diversity. The on-going depth and expertise at which the Relationship Niche Community contributes with the vastness of systems and group coaching work is unparalleled. I, along with Kathy Curry,</p>

It is in this place that we feel stretched to learn and grow, that we long to contribute to other and share ourselves for the sake of something greater than ourselves. I am proud, honored and pleased to have this opportunity to provide the container for this all to occur.  
    <p>This month&rsquo;s issue, we hear from the newly formed Katrina Co-Active Initiative <a href="#niche" class="orange">Niche Community</a>, followed by our Istanbul, Turkey, <a href="#geography" class="orange">Geographic Community</a>.

Life has been busy, alive and, in some ways, quite settled. I write best when turmoil stirs in my heart, sometimes for myself, others times for others. This week has been such a week of celebration, full of such activity and people that I haven't had time for much reflection. When I have, my mood and thoughts have been high and clear. Winter is coming and with it comes the never-ending rain. Maybe that will be when the dark-side will bring us some new light. I suppose some might wonder what that means. </p>
	  <p> The dark side: we all have one. Think about it, all those things we don't like about ourselves. Bad habits, behaviors, attitudes we've been told are not nice; many things make up our dark side. Too often it is suppressed, not to be recognized or embraced. Rather than admit it is there, we would prefer to say we don't suffer from any of these afflictions and suppress the negative aspect. Here's the rub: what you deny owns you, what you accept gives you back your power. Deny it and what you resist will persist. The irony is that the whole consists of both dark and light. </p>

Or if you have operated totally solo and are wondering how such an arrangement could/should work, then be sure to join us for our upcoming telecall on October 12 on the topic of subcontracting. Some of the questions we’ll be in conversation about are: • What are your experiences with subcontracting? • What works well, what doesn’t? • What are best practices? • How can subcontracting be co-active? • What is the difference between subcontracting and partnering? • What should one consider about managing a coaching contract? • What should one consider when deciding whether to be part of another coach’s contract?
