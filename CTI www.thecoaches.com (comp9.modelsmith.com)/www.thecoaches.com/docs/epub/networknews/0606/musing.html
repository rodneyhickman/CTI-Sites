      <h2><b>Piercing Chronicles </b></h2>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have a pierced belly button. Not an unusual thing at all  these days. Except I'm 42&hellip;42 and overweight&hellip;42, overweight, with no intention  whatsoever of showing my belly to the world. What, you may ask, does a  42-year-old woman with a decidedly soft (OK, fat) tummy want with a belly  piercing? Am I trying to recapture my youth, kind of a delayed teenage  rebellion? Am I hoping a piercing will make me cool and hip rather than middle  aged and boring? Was I drinking at the time, or did I lose a bet? No. I got the  piercing because I really, really wanted it. Have for a really long time. Years  in fact! I got it because it's fun and I wanted to stop putting off fun in my  life until I got a better body. I got it because I am tired to my bones of trying  to appease the unending choirs of critical inner judgments and criticisms of my  body and what it deserves. Truly, I got the piercing as a way to create a  relationship with my body from a place of acceptance and beauty (with maybe a  bit of adolescent rebellion thrown in). </p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I can't exactly explain the attraction to sticking a piece  of metal (albeit a very pretty, shinny piece of metal with diamond-like stones  on both ends) through the flesh of my least favorite body part. What I do know  from all my transforming personal and spiritual growth is that something that  holds so much attraction over time has something to teach, so pay attention.  So, I finally got around to paying attention. The main reason I didn't do this  sooner is because I don't like my stomach. Actually, if I tell the truth, I  have believed that bludgeoning inner voice that says I don't deserve it because  I'm fat. No one with a stomach like mine deserves to have something so fun or  sexy. And besides, it would look just stupid and awful anyway. Ouch! OUCH! As I  really let myself hear what I was telling myself, the uncensored cruelty of it,  and let myself feel the pain of it, something shifted in me. My inner mamma  lion came roaring in with all her protective, loving fury, stopping this self-inflicted  abuse. I got angry, really angry at treating myself in a way I would never  tolerate from anyone else. Angry that I put myself on hold, waiting for a  better body. I understand that we live a culture that worships protruding hip  bones, considers visible ribs a beauty statement and treats aging as a disease  to eradicate, but it wasn't Madison Avenue inside my head with labels like  &quot;ugly,&quot; &quot;pathetic,&quot; &quot;unworthy.&quot; That was all me.  I'm the one who has been selling out my joy to an inner dictator of my own  making. Well, consider my piercing the beginning of the coup! </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So, here it is 10 months later and I am so HAPPY I got this  piercing. It has created such a FUN way for me to connect and be with this part  of my body I have judged and hated for so long. The healing has been easy, not  completely pain-free, but close. Complete healing takes 8-12 months, so me and  my belly have had lots of time to create a new relationship with each other.  And my inner dictator? It's no match for the smile that I get every time I look  down and see my belly button sparkle. Gives a whole new meaning to &quot;navel  gazing&quot; and I like it! </p>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I still do not have washboard abs. I'm still overweight. But  I've gained something so much more valuable over the past months really tending  to the physical and spiritual healing of my belly. I know my body is amazing.  It deserves adornment and love and appreciation and celebration, which I'm now  willing to give. I love how a piece of metal has given me what years of  criticism and self-denial could never give&mdash;self-acceptance and FUN. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course, piercing as a path to self-acceptance is not  everyone's cup of tea. So while it may not be a belly ring you're after, what  is it you deny yourself because your inner dictator is running your show? What  is the joy in your life you are no longer willing to giveup? What will you  claim for yourself today that will start your own inner coup of self-love? </p>
