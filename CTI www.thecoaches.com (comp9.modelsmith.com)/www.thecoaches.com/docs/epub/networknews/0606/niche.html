      <h2><b>Spiral Dynamics  Integral Niche</b></h2>
      <p>I overheard a conversation the other day. It sounded  something like this:</p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary:</b><br>
        Hi, John. I see you signed up for the  Spiral Dynamics Integral niche on the Co-Active Network. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>John:</b><br>
        Yes, I&rsquo;ve been in the niche for over a year  now.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary:</b><br>
        I haven&rsquo;t been there as long as you,  only four or five months, and I saw the first email posted for the group last  week. What&rsquo;s the deal? Is this niche doing anything at all?</p>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>John:</b><br>
        Not much as far as I can tell. I&rsquo;m  really curious about this Spiral. I&rsquo;ve had several conversations with other  coaches who are really excited about it. But I don&rsquo;t know much about Spiral  Dynamics Integral and very little has happened inside this niche.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Occasionally, an email like the one you  mentioned gets posted that again exclaims the excitement and buzz about Spiral  Dynamics. And there was a bit of activity when the niche formed a year ago. But  for the most part nothing has happened.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary:</b><br>
      So I am really interested in this  subject, John. Do you have any suggestion about how to leverage this niche to  support my interest?</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Before John could answer I had to interrupt their  conversation and introduce myself.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hi. My name is Cherie Beck. I am an organizer for the SDi  niche on the CoActive Network. I am sorry for eavesdropping, and my ears were  burning so I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I am so pleased to hear that you are talking about Spiral  Dynamics, and yes, this niche has been slow to gain momentum, yet the interest  in the topic just seems to grow. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I recently returned from a conference sponsored by the Edges  Coaches Community, where both Don Beck and I presented the basics of Spiral  Dynamics Integral and its application to coaching. It was a tremendous success  and the coaching aspect is really beginning to take shape. For the past year,  many of us have been deepening our learning and using our clients to experiment  with, and it seems like we&rsquo;ve been able to squeeze enough juice now to attract  the attention of many more coaches. Even Don Beck, the originator of Spiral  Dynamics (popularized from the work of Clare W. Graves), who had very little  personal experience with life or executive coaching, could clearly see the  value. In fact, at the Edges conference, we added another stream from personal  coaching to this newly emerging wave (somatics, embodied leadership and  wisdom), as taught by the Strozzi Institute, into the mix and the results were  really exciting.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>John:</b><br>
        I really would like to know more about how Spiral Dynamics  Integral and coaching work together, Cherie. What are you learning about it?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Cherie:</b><br>
        That&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer in a sound byte, John,  because there is so much to point to. In service of offering a bottom line, let  me make this statement: a significant advantage of learning Spiral Dynamics  Integral is the perspective it offers us to coach from. This perspective helps  us see and hear <i>into</i> our clients,  their agenda and their lives in ways no other perspective I&rsquo;m aware of does.  Think about how medical professionals assisted in the health and wellness of  clients before we had microscopes, MRIs and laser technology. Spiral Dynamics  Integral helps us to see smaller subtler causes deep within the landscape of  our clients&rsquo; lives and businesses, and then to match the appropriate resources  and skillful means like laser beams to meet the coaching situation. Spiral  Dynamics Integral will deepen, expand and target your coaching like nothing  I&rsquo;ve come across this far, while at the same time utilizing or underlining all  what we know and have mastered thus far. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary:</b><br>
        That sounds like a very powerful platform to coach from.</p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Cherie:</b><br>
        I&rsquo;ve certainly found that it is. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The challenge early on remains, however, to commit to  learning enough about the basics of Spiral Dynamics Integral in order to  participate, contribute and practice the rich complexity found within it. So,  in part, the lack of momentum experienced in the SDi niche was due to efforts  toward developing pathways into the model in smaller and smaller chunks, and  pathways out for those who do invest in the Spiral Dynamics model and seek to  apply it more directly to their clients.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Your conversation, Mary and John, is so timely because there  are several new offerings launching over the next several months to help the  200 members of our niche take smaller steps, choose smaller investments of  time, money and thinking to build a knowledge base incrementally from which we  can have meaningful dialogue through the Co-Active Network virtual platform.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary:</b><br>
        That sounds great Cherie. Where can we find out more about what  will be launching?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Cherie:</b><br>
        There are two places. First, over the next week or two,  watch for additional postings through the SDi niche. Second, I am requesting  you also sign up under <a href="http://www.thenextwave.us/" target="_blank">www.thenextwave.us</a>.  By adding your name to this list, you take another &ldquo;baby&rdquo; step toward investing  yourself in pathways to learning the Spiral and augmenting your coaching  practice. It also will help indicate how many of the people registered as  members of the SDi niche on the Co-Active Network are actively interested in  the topic. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Let me add, my conviction that the field of coaching has a  major role to play in the unfolding of the Spiral has grown stronger over the  last year. If you are interested in this topic at all, I assert that the master  Spiral <span style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0606/Niche.jpg" width="84" height="124" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b></span>intelligence within you is at work. Trust me, that intelligence is  smarter than we are!&nbsp; It will lead you to  your own fulfillment, for its function is to help us adapt to the life  conditions we live in. </p>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We in the Spiral Dynamics Group seek to live the &ldquo;prime  directive&rdquo; of the Spiral and create a world of Thrive and Help Thrive. Sounds  like ripe conditions, sweet and juicy for coaching, don&rsquo;t you think?!</p>
