      <p><b>Dutch Treat</b><br>
by Joke (say &ldquo;Yoka&rdquo;)  Botman, CPCC </p>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0605/geo.jpg" width="149" height="100" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Dutch  Treat has a whole new meaning now that the Co-Active coaching courses have been  introduced in the Netherlands! A strong and vibrant community is starting to  bloom in Holland (like a beautiful tulip), full of enthusiastic coaches who got  acquainted with the Co-Active way of coaching. Here is what an experienced  coach had to say after the class: &ldquo;I am more conscious of my personal behavior in coaching, less serious. I  will dance more and rely on my power and skills.&rdquo; And a woman new to the  coaching profession: &ldquo;All will be different. It is like starting from zero.  Through intuition, I will use my heart more and my mind less.&rdquo;</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Beginning this year,  Dance2Move (a company of my business partner Wim Vermaak and me) is bringing  the CTI courses to the Netherlands and Belgium. In January and in March, we had  a Fundamentals course, and from April through July, the first intermediate  series is taking place. After the summer, the second series is planned.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Netherlands has a  number of coaching schools, as do most countries in the world. However,  Co-Active coaching is the first ICF-accredited, in-person coach education to be  offered here, and, of course, we are very proud of that.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are also very keen on  supporting the ICF in the Netherlands. Right now, the ICF is not as established  as we would like it to be in Europe as the representative of all coaches in the  world. We hope the ICF, with the bond between CTI and ICF and the  accreditation, will grow strong in this part of the world and be recognized as  the leading body for certified coaches. Companies have a great need for a  reliable accreditation; they know they are hiring a &ldquo;real&rdquo; and well-educated  coach when s/he has an accreditation. Bringing the first ICF-accredited  in-person coach education to the Netherlands and Belgium is a big step forward  in reaching that goal. We are very excited about that. </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Most participants of the  courses are Dutch, but we do have some people from England, Germany and Norway.  The participants are so very excited about Co-Active coaching and about the  fantastic leaders; being an &ldquo;older&rdquo; Co-Active coach, it is heartwarming to see  this excitement. (I do encourage everybody to assist at a course, because a few  years after your own education, you pick up a whole lot from the back of the  room!)</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A new feature is that we  started a private community on the Co-Active network, the Dutch Co-Active  Student Club, which gives students a place to communicate with each other and  ask all kinds of questions to the organizers. Telephone group calls will be one  of the ways to connect (and get used to the certification calls). </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After students &ldquo;graduate,&rdquo;  they can join the Dutch Co-Active Club, which is a gathering of all Co-Active  coaches living in the Netherlands (and may be a native English speaker, and  there are many of them) and Dutch Co-Active coaches living abroad. The Club has  not been very active yet in gatherings. It is always good to know of each  other, and know where to find a colleague trained in the same philosophy. </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For me, personally, it is  great to see this Dutch Co-Active community expand. I started my training in  2001 in England, and in 2003 became the first Dutch CPCC living in the  Netherlands. And sometimes that felt lonely. So watching all these great people  join up is a tremendous joy. By the way, have you noticed, too, that people who  participate in the Co-Active coaching courses are so interesting and driven and  great fun and sincere&mdash;just about the nicest people you would want to meet anywhere.  I feel very grateful and look forward to a sparkling Co-Active future for  coaching in the Netherlands and Belgium!</p>
