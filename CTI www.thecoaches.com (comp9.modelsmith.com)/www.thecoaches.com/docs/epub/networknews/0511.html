What a wonderful and timely reminder to stay present and breathe into what is, right now, in front of me. This time of year is abundant with activity in the coaching industry, the conversations pick up speed, and we make commitments to start new threads in our lives.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Speaking of threads! Thanks for all the contributions this past month on the discussion boards. Is it hard or is it easy? You tell me, and I don’t mean the difficulty in clicking your mouse around the Co-Active Network. Lots of learning, letting go, attachment, authenticity, joy and anger have been present lately. Isn’t it wonderful being human?

      <p align="left" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Recently, I found myself caught up in a heated discussion about the value of dreams. A fellow traveller equated dreams with delusions. I preferred to view them as the source of inspired being and action that lead to a fulfilled and joyful life. This debate and an earlier conversation with my coach prompted me upon waking one day to consider my role as a “dream whisperer.” Is coaching like horse whispering?
      <p align="left" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Horse whisperers are known for their magical, intuitive communication skills with horses. They display thoughtfulness, gentleness, sensitivity, perceptiveness, confidence and quiet strength to have a successful relationship with horses. They are grounded yet dance in the moment, mirroring the mood and energy of the horses to build trust. We even have horse whisperers within our CTI community, such as Ann Romberg and Rebecca Hourston. They provide inspiring role models.

Sound good? I thought so.    
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Promos</b> are a wonderful way to get your products and services out there to the greater community, and it creates great visibility. Please remember that when you’re posting your product or service to the community that you “post a message” under the Promos thread in the Public Discussion thread listing. I’ve been seeing promos posted outside of this thread lately. Please do the community a service and keep it easy. Selling belongs in the Promos thread. Thanks!	
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Daily Digests </b>have taken on a whole new look and feel. Have you noticed? Please remember: do not reply to the digest as a whole. Boy, is that messy in my inbox! I’ve been hearing some great feedback regarding the ease of reading the digests now. We’ve received some wonderful assistance on the re-design of the digest format. The amazingly talented and gifted<b> Fernando Lopez </b>has contributed to the Co-Active Network once again. He was one of the main contributors in terms of functionality design and testing when we first began the Co-Active Network. CTI will forever be graced with his impact and contribution. Thanks Fernando! (He is also one of the organizers of the Relationship Coaching Niche.)     
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Bridgelines </b>are sometimes a bit challenging to find when it’s that time to get on the call and participate in some hot topic. First, go to the community that is sponsoring the event and click into the event. Sometimes it is posted in the event description closer to the date of the call. Second, if it’s not there, go to the “About This Community” in the left nav bar and see who the organizers are. Click on one of them to get their contact email address and maybe their work number to see if they have the number for you. Third and lastly, contact me at <a href="mailto:Networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a>. I may not always have the number, as the communities use other services for their bridgelines outside the ones that CTI provides.

It seems to me that what you are really wondering about is how to keep a long-term relationship fulfilling and vital. Just as you must put energy and attention into the needs of a romantic relationship, you must also pay attention and invest energy in your relationship with coaching.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Appreciative Inquiry (“AI”) is an affirmative approach that an individual, group, organization or community can use to discover and create a more positive future. AI shifts people’s attention away from problems as the motivation for change, toward capabilities, dreams, vision, potential, possibilities and innovation. When the focus is on the positive and affirmative, body mind and spirit are more naturally connected and infused with boundless energy, creativity, liveliness, power and clarity. Come learn the four major principles of AI and how, as a coach, coming from an appreciative perspective allows your clients to know their true selves more deeply and to move forward more rapidly. As a coach, find out how “being appreciative” amplifies your own talents and abilities.

Read the book if you can, and if you don’t have time, come to the call anyway. November’s book discussion will focus on <i>Secrets of Six-Figure Women</i> by Barbara Stanny. This book is a rousing and encouraging kick in the pants for anyone who isn’t earning as much money as they would like. Though the book is geared toward women, men can benefit from Stanny’s call to financial success. The discussion, led by Cynthia Morris, will spur you to move toward your financial empowerment and give you tips on how to do the same for your "starving artist" clients!
