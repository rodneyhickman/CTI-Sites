We’ve topped the 6,000-member mark on the Co-Active Network, and we’re delighted at the CTI office to once again find another “anything” to celebrate. We’re beginning to master the art of celebration here…so, YAY! We’ve also had two wonderful Main Community Events in January to celebrate. I’m pleased to continue adding these events throughout the year. We have Gail Gordon and Henry Kimsey-House, the creators of CTI’s “Come Alive” course speaking in February and another special guest on the docket.

Our community members are finding  ways to partner with other professionals, such as financial planners,  accountants, estate lawyers and health care professionals to provide the  lifestyle component for these many retirees as they plan for active and  successful retirement years.</p>

	  <p><b>I have a confession.</b><br>
  I was a geek in grade school. I was that nerdy girl wearing the polyester  &quot;floods&quot; from Pic&rsquo;n Save. I kept my nose in books like <i>Jane Eyre</i> or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Small talk baffled me. Then in the sixth grade,  two popular girls adopted me. They took me to the mall and taught me how to  dress, became my friends and included me in their activities. Soon I was  learning how to make friends and flirt and hold my own with the  &quot;cool&quot; kids (politically active, articulate, popular, musically hip)  I admired. What happened? These two girls pulled me up to their level of social  finesse by association. And these girls were great people&mdash;smart, socially  aware, responsible and compassionate human beings. People I admire to this day.  Our values meshed. And they knew something I needed to learn about social  rapport. </p>

To maximize the learning, it is imperative for all callers to  mute their phones unless speaking or asked to speak from the presenter. It is  not fair to the presenter to consistently ask callers to mute their phones  while extraneous sounds are occurring. If you do not already have an external  mute button or feature on your phone, please test *6 on your phone with  someone. While *6 may mute some phone systems, it is not a guarantee. You may  &ldquo;think&rdquo; you are muted when in fact you are not. Some of the wacky sounds we&rsquo;ve  heard just today and last week are nose blowing, a gaseous member whose burp  resonated for a couple of moments, a plethora of outdoor sounds, kitchen sounds  (need I say more?) and even a hushed expletive. As you can see, I am passionate  about giving the respect to presenters that they deserve.</p>

    <p>Dear V. J.: <br>
      This is a  prime opportunity to apply a lot of curiosity in your coaching. Clearly, your  client has an attachment to past events. Rather than assume that it&rsquo;s  necessarily a bad thing, try changing your perspective and imagine that his  &ldquo;past&rdquo; is now being relived in his present. What if there is a helpful message  that these events are trying to communicate to him? </p>

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Join us as Marlena Field, CPCC, leads us in a discussion of how we can more fully help our clients become aware of, and learn from, their body signals and the wisdom of the body. Marlena will do a demonstration of helping a client remember a true sense of aliveness and integrating that into what is currently happening with that person’s body and life. Marlena is the author of Body-Centered Coaching: Using the Body as a Resource for Change.
