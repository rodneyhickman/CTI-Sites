	  <p>Did you know it is a good idea to log out each time you finish accessing the Co-Active Network and log in fresh each time you go to the site? Closing the browser is not sufficient to log you out of the system. You need to actually click the &ldquo;Logout&rdquo; link by your name to get the job done.</p>
	  <p>There are several reasons why regularly logging out is in your best interest, as well as the interest of the entire community. Logging off when you are finished accessing the Network helps reduce the load on the servers and keeps everyone&rsquo;s online experience as quick as possible. Logging off helps clear and reset your login account, which, in turn, reduces the likelihood of quirky, inexplicable system behavior getting in your way. Logging off also clears the web page cache off your computer and ensures that you are looking at the most current versions of Network web pages.<br>

	    <img src="marcia.jpg" alt="Marcia" width="80" height="108" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Last week I had an &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; epiphany about why Co-Active Network emails and daily digests suddenly stop being delivered to members. A recent spike in the number of members who have reported this phenomenon had me stumped for a technical answer to the problem. As it turns out, the solution is so simple it took me a month to think of it. Logout then log back in.</p>
	  <p>Most of the reported problems were likely caused by an email sent to the member&rsquo;s address from our system that bounced. Probably a temporary glitch on the member&rsquo;s email provider&rsquo;s servers. When that happens, the Co-Active Network platform automatically stops mailing that email address until confirmation is received that the email address in question is a valid one. </p>
	  <p>The member does not receive notification of this hold because the Co-Active Network system has their email address on hold. Network Support does not receive notification of this hold to keep the Network Support in-box from perpetual deluge. The good news is that clearing the hold is most easily done by the Network member.</p>
	  <p>How to clear the hold:<br>
	    Start by going to http://www.coactivenetwork.com and making sure that you are logged out. Look at the top of the green box on the left edge of the screen. If it says, &ldquo;Welcome Guest&rdquo; then you are logged out. If it says &ldquo;Welcome [Your Name]&rdquo; then click the &ldquo;Logout&rdquo; link next to your name. Next, log back in. If email to you did indeed bounce, then a message will notify you when you login fresh. Just follow the instructions on that screen to clear the hold on your email.<br>

      That brings me to the most personal reason why it is a good idea to logout. If you never logout, you never pass the place that informs you that your email is on hold due to a bounce.    </p>
