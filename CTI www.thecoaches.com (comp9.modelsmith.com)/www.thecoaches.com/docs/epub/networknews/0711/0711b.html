	  <p><strong>Future of the Newsletter</strong></p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Hello Friends,</p>
	  <p>The Co-Active Network has been in transition for a while and will be for a while longer. We have good things planned and are working on getting resources in place. Because of this background activity, we've been quiet lately so we thought you might be asking &quot;What happened to the <em>Co-Active Network News?&quot;</em></p>
	  <p>Since the inception of CTI (oh, so many years ago), we have published a quarterly newsletter called <em>The Inquiry</em>, a newsletter about coaching and CTI.&nbsp;With the appearance of the Co-Active Network on the scene a few years ago, we created for you the <em>Co-Active Network News,</em> which was issued monthly come rain or shine!&nbsp; </p>

      <b>Promos Restructured<br>
      </b>by Marcia Norris <br>
    


      
      <p>If you keep up with the discussions taking place in the Main Community, you will have noticed considerable dialogue about Promos in recent weeks. Some people love them, some people dislike them. Some people find promos informative and other people find them intrusive. Take the promos down. Leave promos alone. Exile promos to their own community. Reorganize promos this way, reorganize promos that way. Keep those promos away from my in-box!</p>
      <p>I've thoroughly read every posting on the topic, discussed ideas on a call with Community Leaders in October, and I've been experimenting with the options allowed by the technology platform that supports the Co-Active Network. Improving the accessibility and organization of promotional postings has been on my mind since July.</p>
      <p>By the time you read this newsletter, the structure of Promos will be changed to a format that represents a compromise of organizational structure, technology and popular opinion. What you are used to seeing as the PROMOs thread within the Main Community Discussion area is now a series of folders set aside in the discussion area.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/folder.gif" alt="&#8226;" width="18" height="14" align="baseline"> Network Events</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/folder.gif" alt="&#8226;" width="18" height="14" align="baseline"> Client/Coach Match</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/folder.gif" alt="&#8226;" width="18" height="14" align="baseline"> Promotions &amp; Announcements </p>
        <p><strong>Threads: </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Calls, Events, Training, Conferences <br>
              Free Resource Sharing<br>
              Professional Services Offered<br>
              $$$$ Products: Books, CDs, etc.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Network Events</strong> is the place for Community Leaders to publish free events sponsored by the various niche and geographic communities on the Network. <strong>Client/Coach Match</strong> is the place to look for coaching offers and requests, setting up triads, volunteering for or seeking certification/exam practice. <strong>Promotions &amp; Announcements</strong> will have sub-threads as outlined above to compartmentalize the most common posting topics you see in promos.</p>
      <p>Each folder and sub-thread has been seeded with live examples moved from the PROMOs thread that I've decommissioned. When you enter one of these new folders, you will find brief notes on posting guidelines and instructions for things like subject line standards to help you get your bearings. The details are also available in a document called <span class="orange"><a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?293@409.28XybG0lzeN.74@.3d1189c3" target="_blank" class="orange">&quot;Promotion Posting Guidelines.pdf</a></a></span> located in the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@453.0bdBbdV4zVg.0@.3c3e8d09" target="_blank" class="orange">Resources</a> area of the Main Community. </p>
      <p>What does this all mean? First of all, it means that what we currently refer to as &quot;promos&quot; will be separated out from the discussions threads in the daily digest. Yes, that means that separate digests will land in your email box for each folder, but you will be able to more easily determine what items you want to read. Now you will receive &quot;Digest from Public Discussions,&quot; as you always do, along with the new &quot;Digest from Network Events,&quot; &quot;Digest from Client/Coach Match,&quot; and &quot;Digest from Promotions &amp; Announcements.&quot;</p>
      <p>While I would have preferred to separate out the promos topics within the existing daily digest, the Network's software platform does not allow it. Hence the compromise to multiple digests. Based on the volume of postings I've observed, you probably won't receive all the digest titles every day. Some topics just don't get that much play.</p>
      <p>With this organizational structure in place, you will be better able to skim the items you are interested in and skip those you are not. And if you decide later to investigate something, it will be much easier to locate it within the folder structure in the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@777.5PezbcPRz4f.0@.3c3f090f" target="_blank" class="orange">discussion area</a> on the Co-Active Network. Got an hour to kill? Now you can cruise the &quot;Network Events&quot; folder to see if there is a niche call topic scheduled today you might be interested in. Easy.<a name="geography"></a></b></span></p>

	  by Marcia Norris</span>
      <p>Did you know it is a good idea to log out each time you finish accessing the Co-Active Network and log in fresh each time you go to the site? Closing the browser is not sufficient to log you out of the system. You need to actually click the &quot;Logout&quot; link by your name to get the job done.</p>
	  <p>There are several reasons why regularly logging out is in your best interest, as well as the interest of the entire community. Logging off when you are finished accessing the Network helps reduce the load on the servers and keeps everyone's online experience as quick as possible. Logging off helps clear and reset your login account, which, in turn, reduces the likelihood of quirky, inexplicable system behavior getting in your way. Logging off also clears the web page cache off your computer and ensures that you are looking at the most current versions of Network web pages.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/marcia_photo.jpg" alt="Marcia" width="80" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Last week I had an &quot;Aha!&quot; epiphany about why Co-Active Network emails and daily digests suddenly stop being delivered to members. A recent spike in the number of members who have reported this phenomenon had me stumped for a technical answer to the problem. As it turns out, the solution is so simple it took me a month to think of it. Logout then log back in.</p>
	  <p>Most of the reported problems were likely caused by an email sent to the member's address from our system that bounced. Probably a temporary glitch on the member's email provider's servers. When that happens, the Co-Active Network platform automatically stops mailing that email address until confirmation is received that the email address in question is a valid one. </p>
	  <p>The member does not receive notification of this hold because the Co-Active Network system has their email address on hold. Network Support does not receive notification of this hold to keep the Network Support in-box from perpetual deluge. The good news is that clearing the hold is most easily done by the Network member.</p>
	  <p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/logout.gif" alt="Logout screen" width="198" height="106" border="0" align="right">How to clear the hold:<br>
	    Start by going to <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com" target="_blank" class="orange">http://www.coactivenetwork.com</a> and making sure that you are logged out. Look at the top of the green box on the left edge of the screen. If it says, &quot;Welcome Guest&quot; then you are logged out. If it says &quot;Welcome [Your Name]&quot; then click the &quot;Logout&quot; link next to your name. Next, log back in. If email to you did indeed bounce, then a message will notify you when you login fresh. Just follow the instructions on that screen to clear the hold on your email.<br>
	    <br>
	    That brings me to the most personal reason why it is a good idea to logout. If you never logout, you never pass the place that informs you that your email is on hold due to a bounce. </p>

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 0 0 0 0">by Marcia Norris</span>
      <p>Several inquiries have come in to <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> recently about contents in the Main Community daily digest. One example is, &quot;Why is the whole long string of the daily digest repeated several times in the email I receive?&quot;</p>
      <p>When you see multiple copies of the same daily digest nested within one daily digest email, that is the result of someone responding to a posting incorrectly. Clicking the Reply button on your email software causes the entire original digest--not just the message to which you intend to respond--to be directed back into the thread along with your response.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, once someone responds using the incorrect method, there is no way to remove the over-long messages from the digest. It is an easy mistake to make when you are reading quickly and are inspired to respond.</p>
      <p><strong>Reply Correctly</strong><br>
        Let's review the correct way to reply to a message post to minimize the instances of this annoyance. I know it is habit to hit the &quot;Reply&quot; button on your email software, but please try to be aware of your automatic response and use the &quot;Reply&quot; links that have been included in the daily digest when you want to respond to a message.</p>
      <p>If you break down the daily digest you receive and look at it section by section, you will see that after each individual message there are several links: &quot;Reply to sender,&quot; &quot;Reply to all&quot; and &quot;View all past replies to '[Title of thread].'&quot; The correct way to reply to a posting from within your daily digest is to use either the &quot;Reply to sender&quot; or the &quot;Reply to all&quot; link provided.</p>
      <p>Using one of the two &quot;Reply&quot; link options below the specific message post you want to respond to will direct only your response into the discussion thread, not the entire digest. The sample digest graphic below illustrates the basic parts of a standard digest.</p>
     
          <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0711/screenshot.gif" alt="screenshot" width="245" height="223" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">
      <p>Notice how an individual message is separated from other messages by the horizontal lines. Each message is titled, dated, sourced (who sent it), and then reply and view options are added at the foot.</p>
      <p><strong>Think Before You Click</strong><br>
        Since we are talking about the &quot;Reply to sender&quot; and the &quot;Reply to all&quot; links provided in the daily digest, this is a good time to review the appropriate times to use each of these reply options.</p>
      <p>When you choose &quot;Reply to sender,&quot; the message you send will go directly to the person who posted the message you are replying to and will not be added to the thread in the discussion area or be collated into the daily digest. It simply goes to the email box of the person who posted the original message. Use this option for personal (as in private or sensitive) replies and any response that does not need to be seen by every single member of the Co-Active Network.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the &quot;Reply to all&quot; option pushes your message out to every member of the community. Use this option for continuing on with open, collegial discussions, sharing of information and resources, and other topics and responses that are of wide interest.</p>
      <p>Please think about the impact of your choice before you click. Ask yourself &quot;Does this message really need to be sent to more than 10,500 email in-boxes?&quot; Or are your comments better sent to one person only? If you need help, contact <span class="orange"><a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a></span>.</p>
