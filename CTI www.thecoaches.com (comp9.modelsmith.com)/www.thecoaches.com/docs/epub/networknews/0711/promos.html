	  <p>If you keep up with the discussions taking place in the Main Community, you will have noticed considerable dialogue about Promos in recent weeks. Some people love them, some people dislike them. Some people find promos informative and other people find them intrusive. Take the promos down. Leave promos alone. Exile promos to their own community. Reorganize promos this way, reorganize promos that way. Keep those promos away from my in-box!</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve thoroughly read every posting on the topic, discussed ideas on a call with Community Leaders in October, and I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with the options allowed by the technology platform that supports the Co-Active Network. Improving the accessibility and organization of promotional postings has been on my mind since July.</p>
      <p>By the time you read this newsletter, the structure of Promos will be changed to a format that represents a compromise of organizational structure, technology and popular opinion. What you are used to seeing as the PROMOs thread within the Main Community Discussion area is now a series of folders set aside in the discussion area.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Network Events</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Client/Coach Match</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Promotions &amp; Announcements
          <p><strong>Threads: </strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Calls, Events, Training, Conferences <br>
              Free Resource Sharing<br>
              Professional Services Offered<br>
              $$$$ Products: Books, CDs, etc.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Network Events</strong> is the place for Community Leaders to publish free events sponsored by the various niche and geographic communities on the Network. <strong>Client/Coach Match</strong> is the place to look for coaching offers and requests, setting up triads, volunteering for or seeking certification/exam practice. <strong>Promotions &amp; Announcements</strong> will have sub-threads as outlined above to compartmentalize the most common posting topics you see in promos.</p>
      <p>Each folder and sub-thread has been seeded with live examples moved from the PROMOs thread that I&rsquo;ve decommissioned. When you enter one of these new folders, you will find brief notes on posting guidelines and instructions for things like subject line standards to help you get your bearings. The details are also available in a document in Resources. You can find that at <a href="http://www." class="orange">[insert URL here when doc is posted]</a>.</p>
      <p>What does this all mean? First of all, it means that what we currently refer to as &ldquo;promos&rdquo; will be separated out from the discussions threads in the daily digest. Yes, that means that separate digests will land in your email box for each folder, but you will be able to more easily determine what items you want to read. Now you will receive &ldquo;Digest from Public Discussions,&rdquo; as you always do, along with the new &ldquo;Digest from Network Events,&rdquo; &ldquo;Digest from Client/Coach Match,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Digest from Promotions &amp; Announcements.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>While I would have preferred to separate out the promos topics within the existing daily digest, the Network&rsquo;s software platform does not allow it. Hence the compromise to multiple digests. Based on the volume of postings I&rsquo;ve observed, you probably won&rsquo;t receive all the digest titles every day. Some topics just don&rsquo;t get that much play.</p>
      <p>With this organizational structure in place, you will be better able to skim the items you are interested in and skip those you are not. And if you decide later to investigate something, it will be much easier to locate it within the folder structure in the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@777.5PezbcPRz4f.0@.3c3f090f" class="orange">discussion area</a> on the Co-Active Network. Got an hour to kill? Now you can cruise the &ldquo;Network Events&rdquo; folder to see if there is a niche call topic scheduled today you might be interested in. Easy.</p>
