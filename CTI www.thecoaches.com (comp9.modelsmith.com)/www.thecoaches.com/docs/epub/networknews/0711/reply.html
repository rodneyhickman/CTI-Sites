	  <p>Several inquiries have come in to networksupport@thecoaches.com recently about contents in the Main Community daily digest. One example is, &ldquo;Why is the whole long string of the daily digest repeated several times in the email I receive?&rdquo;</p>
	  <p>When you see multiple copies of the same daily digest nested within one daily digest email, that is the result of someone responding to a posting incorrectly. Clicking the Reply button on your email software causes the entire original digest&mdash;not just the message to which you intend to respond&mdash;to be directed back into the thread along with your response.</p>
	  <p>Unfortunately, once someone responds using the incorrect method, there is no way to remove the over-long messages from the digest. It is an easy mistake to make when you are reading quickly and are inspired to respond.</p>
	  <p><strong>Reply Correctly</strong><br>
	    Let&rsquo;s review the correct way to reply to a message post to minimize the instances of this annoyance. I know it is habit to hit the &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; button on your email software, but please try to be aware of your automatic response and use the &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; links that have been included in the daily digest when you want to respond to a message.</p>
	  <p>If you break down the daily digest you receive and look at it section by section, you will see that after each individual message there are several links: &ldquo;Reply to sender,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reply to all&rdquo; and &ldquo;View all past replies to &lsquo;[Title of thread].&rsquo;&rdquo; The correct way to reply to a posting from within your daily digest is to use either the &ldquo;Reply to sender&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Reply to all&rdquo; link provided.</p>
	  <p>Using one of the two &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; link options below the specific message post you want to respond to will direct only your response into the discussion thread, not the entire digest. The sample digest graphic below illustrates the basic parts of a standard digest.</p>
	  <p><br>
          <img src="screenshot.gif" alt="screenshot" width="245" height="223"></p>
	  <p>Notice how an individual message is separated from other messages by the horizontal lines. Each message is titled, dated, sourced (who sent it), and then reply and view options are added at the foot.</p>
	  <p><strong>Think Before You Click</strong><br>
	    Since we are talking about the &ldquo;Reply to sender&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Reply to all&rdquo; links provided in the daily digest, this is a good time to review the appropriate times to use each of these reply options.</p>
	  <p>When you choose &ldquo;Reply to sender,&rdquo; the message you send will go directly to the person who posted the message you are replying to and will not be added to the thread in the discussion area or be collated into the daily digest. It simply goes to the email box of the person who posted the original message. Use this option for personal (as in private or sensitive) replies and any response that does not need to be seen by every single member of the Co-Active Network.</p>
	  <p>In contrast, the &ldquo;Reply to all&rdquo; option pushes your message out to every member of the community. Use this option for continuing on with open, collegial discussions, sharing of information and resources, and other topics and responses that are of wide interest.</p>
	  <p>Please think about the impact of your choice before you click. Ask yourself &ldquo;Does this message really need to be sent to more than 10,500 email in-boxes?&rdquo; Or are your comments better sent to one person only? If you need help, contact <span class="orange"><a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a></span>.</p>
