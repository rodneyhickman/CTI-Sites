	  	    by Ute Kueffner, CPCC, ACC, and Hannes Entz von Zerssen,  CPCC, PCC
	  	    <p>It is from the place of fulfillment that we write this note  to you all. It is June and the soccer world cup is taking place in Germany. The  German team has played well and will move on to the next round. Juergen  Klinsmann, the German coach, has brought on a good team spirit and changed the  way of interacting with the players. It appears that he was able to install a  sort of Future Self with the team. They have created a vision of themselves as  a team. With this in mind it is almost secondary to win the game. It appears to  be a win to play as well as possible in the moment. This permission is  seemingly pulling them together as a team, and what is more surprising is that  it is inspiring the whole country. We have never seen our country caught up in  such a positive, inspired and fulfilled state since the fall of the Berlin wall  in 1989. Fulfillment is happening in Germany.</p>
	  <p>Why are we writing all this right now? We are sitting in the  first Fulfillment course ever held in Germany. It seems apt to write about the  fulfillment of a dream we have had for some years. It was about bringing  Co-Active Coaching to Germany. It was about bringing light to a place that had  almost forgotten that life can be fun and exciting.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>We set out in August 2005 to establish Co-Active Coaching in  Germany. Our major challenge was, and to a certain extent still is, twofold: </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Germany       is, in regard to coaching, a very established and mature market with a       large number of varied coach training programs.</li>
	    <li>Co-Active       coach training is only available in English and Japanese at this       moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>In spite of this, we had our first Fundamentals course in  Heidelberg in May 2006 and now in June our first Fulfillment course. The  courses have been a huge success. The participants are a delight. They  integrate the Co-Active Coaching model very naturally and with a lot of fun and  ease. Most of the participants signed up for all five courses. We are in the  process of organizing the next series, which will start in September 2006. </p>
	  <p>We write this note with huge gratitude to the participants,  the Co-Active community, the CTI faculty and the founders Laura, Henry and  Karen for inspiring us and keeping the dream alive. We have thrown a pebble  into the water, and we are in awe of the ripples it has already created. What  we see is that the Co-Active Coaching model works across cultures&mdash;it is  universal.</p>
	  <p>Co-Active Coaching is doing well. </p>
	  <p>With love from Germany,<br>
	    Hannes and Ute</p>
