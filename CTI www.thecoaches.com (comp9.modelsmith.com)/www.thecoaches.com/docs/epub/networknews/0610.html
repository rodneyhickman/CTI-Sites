Welcome to October!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re gearing up for yet another ICF conference, and I can feel the whole system buzzing. There’s activity everywhere. I can see the volunteers working at their computers and getting all the details set. The ICF office must be on overdrive right now. We’re busy planning for our party at the conference, which is being held Friday, November 3, at the conference hotel. The party is being sponsored by the Co-Active Network! Are you coming? We want to see you there. A detailed invitation will be sent to the membership of the Co-Active Network in the near future, so look out for it!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’ve had some wonderful posts on the discussions boards lately. You’ve been busy supporting and offering great coaching and advice to those needing an extra hand. How does that saying go? “You may be smarter than me, but you’re not smarter than my team!” I’d say that goes for the membership of the Network. What a wealth of knowledge and life experience that is present here. There is something here for everyone.

The wonderful and talented Fernando Lopez came through and did some great testing on behalf of CTI to ensure that the features work properly. The footer of the discussions now contains new links to help you navigate more effectively while replying. Read this month’s Wizardry column for more details. </p>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This month, we hear from Christine Gilmore and William Tweedley, co-organizers of the Healthcare niche. Then Jill McCullogh, of the European Co-Active Coaches Geographic community, chimes in with what’s happening “across the pond” in Europe. A wonderful poem was offered anonymously for this month’s Musing—it has that “lift you up” feeling. I’ll talk about the new feature added to the discussion areas in the Wizardry column. Then read the insights from our own Dear Judith of the coaching community. We have plenty of events planned for October, so check out the calendar for something to increase that wonderful knowledge bank of yours. Since events are added ongoingly, please come back and check the calendar throughout the month.

       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’d love to acknowledge those of you who have been asking for the discussions to contain a reply feature that would make the user end functionality easier and member-friendly. It’s here. There may be some adjustments that still need to take place, so please be patient, as we are currently live and running this on the Co-Active Network. Fernando Lopez deserves “huzzahs!” from the community for all his work with this.
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You will now notice that the footer of your discussions looks different. You have the ability now to reply to the original sender of the discussion. This is especially wonderful when folks are offering a service or some such item that requires a note back to the author only. The entire membership doesn’t need to know who’s interested or who is saying “Sign me up.” Jeesh!
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Please, everyone, (some of you) slow down and see what’s available before the quick reflexes come into play. Sometimes we just don’t know what we don’t know in terms of the impact we’re having on the system. I notice that oftentimes, items simply haven’t been read all the way through. That’s OK. We get better everyday!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For all the newer members who’ve joined us recently, please know that you have options to design how emails come to you from the Co-Active Network. Visit “Manage Account” in the upper left navigation bar to choose your email delivery option. Also, there is a “Quick Help” link in the upper right side of all pages that gives you a variety of information about the site at large.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you’re stuck, send me an email!</p>

    <p>Dear D.P.: <br>
This is an excellent question and one that all coaches who consider themselves part of the profession should ponder seriously. I don’t know where you are in your coaching training. Are you just beginning or are you currently certified? Regardless of whether you are a novice coach or a certified coach, professional and personal development will serve you.

There are branding-related steps you can take that require little time or effort.

All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, you’re in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or have been doing this for years and would like a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you. Also, since we'll be learning from each other, you’re all encouraged to participate and share your perspectives and experience. Ben Dooley will be your host.
