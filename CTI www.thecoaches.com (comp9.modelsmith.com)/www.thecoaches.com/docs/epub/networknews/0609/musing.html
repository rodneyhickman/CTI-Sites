	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0609/LeBlanc.jpg" alt="Joanne LeBlanc" width="100" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">You know, our Bostonian accent is unique, just like we are. &ldquo;Paak  the caa in Haavid yaad&rdquo; (translation: park the car in Harvard yard). You might  ask yourself, &ldquo;What happened to the letter &lsquo;r&rsquo;?&rdquo; and if you asked a Bostonian,  we would either say nothing at all, or with a sidelong glance remark, &ldquo;What  aah?&rdquo;</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My name is Joanne LeBlanc, and it is my pleasure to invite  you to Boston, Massachusetts, (and to the Boston Co-Active Geographic  Community). </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Three years ago, when I began my CTI courses, I attended a  number of meetings held in person in Boston and met many wonderful coaches  committed to making a difference in the world. I found these group meetings  rich, encouraging and energizing. Little did I know that within three years, I  would find myself stepping up to lead this community.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I consider a large part of my role to be reawakening this  community. Personally, I have a deep desire to explore how we can raise the bar  here in Boston. We have more 140 coaches signed up for our geographic community.  What&rsquo;s possible when we pool our resources for the sake of each other, our  clients and our community?&nbsp;Can you imagine the energy level of a community  that is reawakened?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That is exactly the energy you&rsquo;ll find in the Boston  Co-Active Geographic Community these days. We had our first &ldquo;Think Tank&rdquo; call  in August, beginning the process of brainstorming and fleshing out what this  community wants to create and how it chooses to create it. We will hold a  second &ldquo;Think Tank&rdquo; call in September to accommodate coaches who were unable to  attend our first call. The plan is to resume our in-person meetings in  October!&nbsp;I am committed to engaging as many coaches to join us as possible.  If you have not signed up yet and would like to become a member of the Boston  Co-Active Geographic Community, please go to the Co-Active Network website,  click on geographic communities and hit Boston.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For those who have not experienced it yet, Boston is unique.  Besides the distinctive Bostonian accent, it boasts a rich culture and history.  With all the amenities of a big city, including wonderful restaurants and  entertainment, Boston maintains a very intimate feel. For sporting fans, Boston  is the home of the World Champion New England Patriots and the Boston Red Sox. (And  Boston sports fans?&nbsp;We&rsquo;re about as dedicated and passionate as you can  get. Did somebody say fanatic?)</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We also have one of the largest and most active ICF chapters  in the United States, with more than 350 members. ICF-NE is celebrating its 10-year  anniversary this year. (http://www.icfne.org/index.php). And now CTI has joined  the party by offering its courses in Boston. How much more fabulous can it get?</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Come play and explore in Boston. If you have already  completed your courses, how about assisting in Boston&mdash;to expand your experience  and continue your learning?&nbsp;Great opportunities await you in Boston! The  more the merrier, I say, especially when it comes to a community of coaches!</p>
