by Kendall Colman, MHSA, CPCC
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Please join us monthly for our telecall for more strategies to help you  be successful coaching in organizations.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>1.</b> <b>Back to basics.</b> Take your  Future Self out for lunch and visualize the kind of business, the clients and  the income you want. Volumes of information exist about how to take yourself  (or, hey, hire a coach) to take you through the discovery of creating your  ideal business. If you don&rsquo;t know where you are going, any road will take you  there.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>2.</b> <b>Be clear about your fees and  value.</b> Determining fees, especially in a market where &ldquo;average rates&rdquo; are  so widespread, is not only a practical exercise (e.g. hourly rate, retainer,  packages, annual salary), but also requires the use of intuition as well. Read  some of the great books on the market describing different pricing scenarios.  Good questions to ask yourself for this process include: What do I know now  about the market? How do I know it? What are the real costs? Will it work for  me, for the client?<b> </b>The possibilities: What else can I come up  with? What other interesting ideas are there? What is a new way to do this?  What is my hunch about these fees and my value? For more, listen to last  month&rsquo;s call on pricing at:<b> 405-244-4000, box 606.</b> </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>3.</b> <b>Build a sizable sales funnel.</b> The best way to do this is by constantly building  relationships with people. Whenever you are communicating with a prospect,  provide something of value.&nbsp; Have your  &ldquo;sales pipeline&rdquo; full, as you don&rsquo;t know when your clients will turnover. Build  in a product funnel to support your sales efforts, for example: speaking  engagements, ezines, teleclasses, mentoring programs. Some are free and some  are paid, and everything always adding value. Question: What is something  unique I provide to clients? What do I enjoy doing that will add more value to  my clients? The idea is to have the prospect think, &quot;If I received this  much value in correspondence, how much would I receive if I actually hired this  person?&quot;&nbsp; </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>4.</b> <b>Networking.</b>&nbsp; The power of networking is not in the <i>quantity</i> of the contacts, but in the <i>quality</i> of the contacts. Do research ahead  of time. Learn who will likely attend the event. Introduce yourself without  describing anything about your work and simply listen, ask questions. In the  event you're asked what you do, practice providing very succinct responses.  Immediately follow up, the next morning at the latest, deliver what you  promised. I won&rsquo;t go to another networking meeting until I have followed up  sufficiently with the one I just attended.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>5.</b> <b>Don&rsquo;t sell, coach.</b> I&rsquo;m  amazed at how many of our selling conversations (remember enrollment?) can  easily be turned into coaching conversations. In all selling situations,  networking, meetings, etc., trust yourself and slightly hold back attention so  you can focus on the intelligent information available to you in the Level 3.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>6.</b> <b>Design the alliance, and often:</b> Make sure you do a scope of work, or memorandum of understanding when signing  on for any coaching project within an organization. As people are having more  exposure with a business or executive coach, it is important to be professional  and get agreements vocalized and on paper. Also, design regular feedback with  your clients about how you experience them, their company or their process.  Remember that the number one derailer for leaders and their teams is the  inability to ask, give and receive feedback. It is important to model for them  how to do this.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>7. </b></p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>8.</b>&nbsp; <b>Constantly  educate yourself about what is going on in the business market.</b> Read one  business book a month. I just read <i>Nuts!</i> which was a terrific read about fulfillment in action at Southwest Airlines.  And make a daily practice to read the local business journal. You don't have to  read it cover-to-cover, but simply peruse the headlines so you have an idea of  what&rsquo;s happening, who&rsquo;s who, etc. Also send congratulation letters to those &ldquo;on  the move.&rdquo; People in transition use coaches.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>9.</b> <b>Refine your materials.</b> Know the balance  between providing structure to your coaching offering and dancing in the  moment. Coaching in organizations is more and more about return on the  investment, so make sure you confirm how the client and boss (or sponsor) will  know the value of the coaching. A good question for the discovery session is:  How will achievement of these goals be demonstrated? </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>10.</b> <b>Subcontract and take time off.</b> Can&rsquo;t  learn Dreamweaver and Quickbooks, too? If something is not in your skill set,  then subcontract. Allow for rest and  reflection. Allow the natural process of ebb and flow of building your business  to occur. Being in start up mode can be exhausting over long
