	  </b><br>
	  by Gail Barrie, CTI staff 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0609/barrie.jpg" alt="Gail Barrie" width="100" height="137" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Have  you ever noticed how our full range of emotion gets such a bad rap?<br>
	    Seems  like I&rsquo;ve been noticing this my entire life.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">From  where I sit, this &ldquo;bad rap&rdquo; is a global phenomenon, not just a weird Western  idiosyncrasy. It&rsquo;s a phenomenon that drives who we are in boardrooms, in  bedrooms, around the dinner table and in places of worship all over the world.  Having worked extensively with my own emotions and with clients  internationally, I see a consistent theme: an unconscious belief system that  says: &ldquo;Too much emotion is a bad thing&hellip;moderation or non-emotion is better.&rdquo; No  matter the culture, the underlying message is, &ldquo;Rein in your emotions or suffer  dire consequences.&rdquo; </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What  slays me about this oversimplified LIE is that it applies to all emotions, not  just a few. Don&rsquo;t have or show too much anger&hellip;too much optimism&hellip;too much  grief&hellip;too much joy, hatred, hope, despair, trust. Bottom line: DON&rsquo;T FEEL TOO  MUCH!</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our  emotions are a gift of our birthright as human beings. The rejection,  discounting or dismissal of our emotions feels like saying, &ldquo;Hey God, thanks,  but no thanks,&rdquo; as if there&rsquo;s some major flaw in the exquisite complexity of  Divine Order. The arrogance of that confounds me one moment and leads me to my  compassion for humanity the next. As I continue to embrace the full range of my  emotions, consciously allowing them to flow with responsibility and without  restriction, I find that they are really quite fluid. There is great power in  that fluidity.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Personal  beliefs and practices aside, don&rsquo;t we all want more power? I&rsquo;m not referring to  &ldquo;power over;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m speaking of intrinsic personal power to create anything we  desire. I believe that no matter our age, gender, ethnicity, race or spiritual  orientation, in our healthiest nature, we all want the same things: Well-being  for ourselves and well-being in the world around us. I believe that our best  selves collectively yearn to live life powerfully in wholeness and harmony.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This  may sound too idealistic for your taste, yet since &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; is not the  human condition, I invite you to reawaken and reconnect to your beliefs and  ideals through the lens of emotion. What do you believe about emotions? How  much emotion do you let yourself have and express? Why? These questions are a  part of my daily spiritual practice, assisting me to discover, change and  expand my life exponentially.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When  we engage with a limited range of emotion, we are limiting our personal  potential,<br>
	    as  well as our impact, in the world. Through limited emotional expression, our  unique soul songs have begun to sound like &ldquo;Chopsticks&rdquo; played on a worn out  piano, rather than the complex symphonies they are intended to be. We&rsquo;ve  allowed ourselves to become accustomed to prefer rote, simple-noted plunking  along the keyboard of life, versus giving ourselves permission to use all of  our instruments and our voices to compose and play intricate, deeply moving  masterpieces with ourselves and each other.</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The  world is awakening; it&rsquo;s an exciting time with boundless opportunity. As we  awaken, it&rsquo;s critical that we learn how to take more responsibility for our  emotional health and the emotional health of the planet. It&rsquo;s time to take more  responsibility for our desires by proactively generating emotional well-being.  Within the chaos and complexity of life, we are constantly being called to  support each other and ourselves as much as we can in the process. We need to  give more attention and care to our emotional bodies, which exist to inform,  heal and grow us. Just as we have health clubs and gyms to support our physical  well-being, we must find ways to exercise the muscles of emotional range to  support our emotional well-being.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The  process of strengthening our emotional well-being begins by examining our own  beliefs, rules, and stories about our emotions. We need to look to our early  years for the foundation of our current emotional health.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As  I look back to my own experience as a young white girl, born and raised  Catholic in Detroit, Michigan, USA, by working-class second-generation  immigrants, the programming was pretty clear. The basic messages that I took on  sound something like this: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s GOOD to be happy and nice, to religiously obey  and follow rules and social decorum, or else get in big trouble or get kicked  to the curb. I must sacrifice my individuality as a means to belong, to get  along, to get approval, to be valued and loved, to succeed.&rdquo; Conversely, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  BAD to be unhappy, to be angry, to dislike or hate anyone, even temporarily.  Never be depressed. It&rsquo;s not okay to be sensitive or intense; it&rsquo;s better to be  even-keeled all the time. Emotions are dangerous stuff.&rdquo;</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Somewhere,  I learned that I should not trust my own instincts or stray too far from the <i>&ldquo;</i>norm,&rdquo; to speak or live honestly if it  might rock the boat. By the way, I learned that too much emotion rocks the boat  every time. Heaven forbid I have a tantrum, get depressed, sob my guts out, or  present anything other than a happy face to the world. Of course, too much  happy face was bad, too&hellip;no uncontrollable squealing with delight or ecstatic  dancing with joy&mdash;I might get locked up for that kind of nonsense.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My  old bottom line belief? &ldquo;People can&rsquo;t handle too much emotion. It makes them  uncomfortable and causes upset for everyone including me; it&rsquo;s dangerous  territory, so don&rsquo;t go there!&rdquo; </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While  the content of your story may be very different from mine, look to see how the  dynamic may be the same. Some emotions are &ldquo;good&rdquo; and get you what you want,  and others are &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and will hinder your success. Is that a message you&rsquo;ve  been living with, too?</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If  so, it&rsquo;s time to create some new programming.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">More  and more, I see how my formative programming mixed with a na&iuml;ve belief system  and a natural desire to be loved and valued created quite a cocktail of  personal limitation. I recognize where I&rsquo;ve developed complex strategies to  support limiting my emotional range and, therefore, my personal power. I&rsquo;ve  also unintentionally limited a lot of other people along the way, too. Double  bummer. Sure, these strategies got me a pretty good amount of instant  gratification and sense of false power, yet they also produced a steady diet of  private suffering packed with plenty of struggle, constriction and a chronic  sense of dissatisfaction that lasted decades. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For  the past 25 years, I&rsquo;ve been relearning how to feel my way through life. As I  explore and mature with my emotions, I&rsquo;m becoming more and more empowered. What  I&rsquo;ve come to know is that emotions are pure life force energy. It&rsquo;s what we  choose to DO with our emotions, how we express and act with them that has  positive or negative impact, not the emotion itself. </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It&rsquo;s  crucial that emotions are honored and expressed&hellip;when, how and with whom are  important factors to consider in terms of being responsible and appropriate.  For some, this is not new information, for others it&rsquo;s radical. It doesn&rsquo;t  matter to me where we are on the spectrum of understanding or experience;  there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;right&rdquo; place to be. It does matter that we WAKE UP TO THE RANGE OF  OUR EMOTIONS, that we learn to respect and honor them from a place of true  deserving that lives at the core of every human being.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It&rsquo;s  time to break down the dams of unhealthy programming and let our emotions flow  responsibly and appropriately. If you want a healthier, richer life for  yourself and a healthier, more peaceful world, commit to feeling your way  through it more than ever. And while your emotions are your responsibility, you  don&rsquo;t have to do it alone. Allow yourself to get the support you need with your  loved ones, your coach, your spiritual leader, your bartender, your dog. After  all, we&rsquo;re all on the journey home together.</p>
