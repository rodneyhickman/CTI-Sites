	Greetings Everyone,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Nothing else compares to the generosity and the willingness of the coaches here to share what’s needed in the moment to those in need. When I hear “Help!” I see people immediately asking the question “How?” When I experience a post that has sadness and grief, there is an instant response of nurturing, love and care. The humanitarian experience is awesome, and I believe is a direct result of the coaching movement that is gifting the world. From this place lives growth, expansion and possibility. How positive is THAT? Thank you for gifting each other. The ripples are felt.

  <br>

Christian Coaches Community
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><span style="margin: 3 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0608/niche.gif" width="100" height="103" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b></span>Pamela, a coaching colleague, called me to chat about her Christian client. Pamela was confused. During a long intake, the client had shared that his Christian faith is one of his core values. At the close of the call, as Pamela mirrored back for her client the values she heard, she described him as a “religious” man. He harrumphed and stumbled and was clearly upset by this comment. The clock ran out. The call ended poorly. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This client is not unusual. For many Christians, being “Christian” and being “religious” are worlds apart. Many who follow the teachings of Jesus have grown uneasy with the connotations of being “religious.” Maybe even you. I know for my family, we rarely miss a Sunday service. We pray together and memorize scripture together, yet honestly, I would not say we are “religious.”

“Amazing grace…how sweet the sound”

Special thanks to Lori Shook, for her energy, real commitment and concern; all the leaders, for their openness for new, special Polish culture; the CTI partners, for welcoming us warmly and supporting us our way; and clients, for deciding to trust us. There are many more people that we are grateful to and not enough space to list all the names.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This was a wonderful year (well, we know it is not a full year, so what?). We have run nine courses up until now. The first group of 20 people has finished the whole program. It was like a miracle, a privilege, a grace to be able to see all the students experiencing the strength coming out of the Co-Active way of creating and maintaining relationships—the relationships full of acceptance, respect, sincere interest, concern, and servant-minded.

       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Replying to posts</b> can create an unintended impact on almost 7,400 members of this community. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A common mistake is replying to a PROMO that is in digest  form. You MUST open the post and read it in its entirety before you respond.  Almost always (99.9% of the time), the post contains contact information for  you to sign up or get additional information etc. Please take your time and  thoroughly read the information before you respond too quickly for information  that is already there for you. This has occurred recently to a few posts, with  numerous replies filling our inboxes with single phrase quips of wanting the  phone number or to &ldquo;sign me up&rdquo; or asking how to register. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I know there are exciting opportunities that many of you  want to participate in. Let&rsquo;s be mindful not to inadvertently reply to the  entire membership for such requests.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Helpful hint: By clicking on the author&rsquo;s name of the  original post, you can get their contact information to get additional  questions answered and/or requests addressed. Please contact them privately.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>This phrase&mdash;&ldquo;The item  .1ab23456 does not exist, it may have been deleted&rdquo;&mdash;</b>will show up when you  click a link that has been moved or deleted. Chances are, it was an opportunity  that needed to be moved into the PROMOs thread. Give a look there to find it!</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Reply to sender/Reply  all</b> is a feature that I&rsquo;m still looking into adding to the public and  members-only discussions area. CTI originally designed the discussions to  default with &ldquo;reply all&rdquo; so as to keep the conversation open, alive and  visible. Now that we&rsquo;re at a size that warrants some fine tuning, we&rsquo;re looking  into adding these additional features. Thank you for your persistence in  requesting this. I believe we&rsquo;re able to accommodate. Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>Dear K.M.: <br>
Yes, it is true that I used to be a librarian and it is also true that I am a prolific reader. I love reading books as much as I love coaching. I’m interested in whether you want these recommendations for your own edification or whether you are going to suggest the books to your client. If you are reading these books to find ways that you can be more creative in your own life and with your clients, that is fine. If you are planning to assign one or more of these books to your client as homework, I think that you might want to do some prep work with your client beforehand.
