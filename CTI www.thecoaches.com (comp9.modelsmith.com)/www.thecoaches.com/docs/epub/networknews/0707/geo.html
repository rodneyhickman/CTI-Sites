	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s summer in the RTP region of North Carolina, and it is HOT! 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You know that visceral sensation of dripping with sweat humidity? And then the satisfaction of drinking a cool glass of water or frosty margarita or mint julep by the pool? (Oh yes, choose the metaphor/drink of choice that is most decadently satisfying for you.) You know, lick-your-lips yummy! Absolutely delectable, because it is so hot. Yeah, you know that sensation. Take a moment before you read any further, inhale deeply and savor the flavor as you remember that cool drink going down.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">AND then… 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Remember seeing a fantastic display of fireworks that lights up the sky after a baseball game or on the 4th of July…and the shared excitement and wonder of a community of people “oohing and ahhing” together?
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That’s what’s happening in the RTP region for Carolina Coaches. It is a shared, moving experience captivating all of the senses. This past January, Phil Okrend and I put out a call to Co-Active coaches in the RTP region of North Carolina to gather collectively. Who knew there were so many coaches in North Carolina that don’t coach basketball?  
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When Carolina Coaches meet together in person, it’s authentic. People show up in all their greatness. We share in the exhilaration of getting to know one another and support one another in this fabulous work that we do. There are some amazing and inspiring coaches in North Carolina. Almost weekly, I am pleasantly surprised by an email or a phone call from another person in the area who is either already a coach, interested in becoming a coach or interested in getting a coach. Regardless of where we are in that spectrum, all of us are wanting that tangible, authentic, flavorful interaction with people that inspires and invigorates. Those of us working as coaches bring that incredible aliveness to our clients, our families, our neighbors, and now we are relishing the time of sharing that with each other, as well. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As we grow as a community, we are clarifying what we want as a community. In April, we co-created our statement of what we stand for. (Just so you know, this is not a sit-on-your-ass group of folks. We are STANDING tall for what we are passionate about!)  
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Carolina Coaches is a co-created vehicle for inspired action. We provide professional support, collegial community and accountability for the evolving coaching community in the triangle.
<ul>
  <li>	Some of us are here for co-creation, to develop presentations and connect with other coaches.</li>
  <li>	Some of us are here for the heart space we create together and to cultivate friendship.    </li>
  <li>	Some of us are here looking for inspired action. Some of us are here to create inspired action.    </li>
  <li>	Some of us are here for support and to provide support. Some of us are here for accountability.    </li>
  <li>	Some of us are here for something tangible and structured.    </li>
  <li>	Some of us are here to refuel.    </li>
  <li>	Some of us are here to cultivate community. </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">All of us together create the diversely wonderful Carolina Co-Active Coaching Community. Even in the hot summer, it’s a happening place!
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This summer, we are rolling up our sleeves and sweating out the work of getting the Carolina Coaches website up and useable for people to post workshops, events and opportunities. We are open to the possibilities and excited about partnering with the potential. We want to know who YOU are. We want you to know who we are. So come stimulate your senses, co-create what you desire and share in the abundance of North Carolina.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Enjoy!
