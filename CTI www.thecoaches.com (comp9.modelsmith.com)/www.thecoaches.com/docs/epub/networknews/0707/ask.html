	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear J.S.:</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Enneagram is just one of many personality typing systems that people have devised in order to better understand themselves and others. Don Riso, a noted Enneagram teacher and developer, has defined the Enneagram as “a geometric figure that delineates the nine basic personality types of human nature and their complex relationships.” The Enneagram is a useful tool for understanding oneself and others because it focuses not only upon types of behavior but it is also concerned with underlying attitudes, emotional reactions, conscious and unconscious motivations, as well as spiritual potentials.  
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Enneagram is perhaps the oldest personal typing system. The symbol itself is ancient. Its elements are comprised of mystical, as well as, psychological factors. George Gurdjieff brought the Enneagram system to the West in the early part of the last century, and various people, such as Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo, have broadened the Enneagram’s accessibility to the general public. Currently, teachers such as Don Riso, Ross Hudson, Helen Palmer and Renee Baron continue to expand the work. 
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Enneagram, like any other personality tool, is useful if it is used properly. It is easy to stereotype oneself and others based upon their type. For example, people who know something about astrology might decide that because a person is a “Gemini,” this means “x, y and z” about that person. While “x, y and z” may be true about her or him some of the time, there is no guarantee that these traits will be exhibited all of the time, nor is it true that these are the only traits exhibited by people born under the sign of Gemini. A typing system is a good model from which to look and to become curious. Just as a map is not the actual road, the Enneagram can never completely capture a life experience. However, it is a great way to get oriented to a possible new experience of self or to have an external validation of an internal experience of self, and it is a helpful tool in understanding others. 
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Enneagram is helpful in working with weaker sides of personality and pointing to ways to build on strengths. It is not a static picture. It can be a powerful tool for personal growth.  
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As is true of any coaching interaction, it is important to note whether the tool is serving the client. You can use the Enneagram to inform your own awareness of the client’s patterns and responses. You and your client can explore the Enneagram model together. If the client benefits from the use of the Enneagram, then by all means use it in your work together. If not, then find another way to access similar information. 
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I am not an expert on the Enneagram. However, I can point you to various books and places to find out more information. Several books that I have found helpful are:
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  <i>The Wisdom of the Enneagram: The Complete Guide to Psychological and Spiritual Growth for the Nine Personality Types,</i> by Don Richard Riso and Ross Hudson. Bantam, 1999
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>Discovering Your Personality Type</i>, by Don Richard Riso and Ross Hudson. Houghton Mifflin, 2003
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others in Your Life</i>, by Helen Palmer. HarperSanFrancisco, 1991
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>The Enneagram Made Easy: Discover the Nine Types of People</i>, by Renee Baron and Elizabeth Wagele. HarperSanFrancisco, 1994 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Some web sites to look at: 
       <a href=" http://www.theenneagraminstitute.com" target="_blank"> <br>
       http://www.theenneagraminstitute.com</a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram" target="_blank"><br>
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram</a>
       <a href=" http://www.aptinternational.org/ " target="_blank"> <br>
       http://www.aptinternational.org/ </a>(Association for Personality Type). This is a good place to learn about other personality typing systems; it also lists local places where you can connect with people who do personality typing. 
        
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course if you “google” the Enneagram and “the Enneagram and coaching,” there will be numerous articles and sites to pique your interest. I am sure that within our own Co-Active Network, we have numerous people who can speak to their own use of the Enneagram and its impact with clients. Do also check out the resources available here at the Co-Active Network. I invite others who are more qualified in Enneagram work to add their voices to mine.
