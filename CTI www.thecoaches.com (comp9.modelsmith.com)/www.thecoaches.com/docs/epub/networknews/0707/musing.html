<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Shock. </b>I’m scheduled to lead a course in Canada on August 28. My passport expires two weeks before that. Has it really been 10 years?
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Panic.</b>  I heard it is taking forever to get renewals through. Will I have enough time?
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Dread.</b> Oh no! I have to get my picture taken. Yuck. Will I look 10 years older? And, I’m so hating my hair right now. There is nothing worse than being stuck with a bad photo for 10 years—especially on your passport. Especially if looking at it makes you feel like an old broad when you’re going abroad. But that’s just my saboteur. Or at least I decide that’s what it is. I go get my new photo.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Calm.</b>  I’ve filled out the application and I’m following my instructions. My picture didn’t turn out too bad, after all. I sigh as I write the check, adding in the extra $60 to expedite the process (whatever that means!).
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Curiosity.</b>  I notice I hesitate to put my old passport into the mailing envelope. What’s that about? I thumb through the pages, recalling…
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Wonder.</b> Oh, the places I’ve gone! Paris on my 38th birthday! Twenty-eight gelatos in 14 days in Italy! Two (yes, two) different Club Meds! No, I was not looking for love, and no, it was not the fabled, swinging hotbed of hedonism you might think. Baby Boomers don’t do that anymore—at least not at Club Med. Well, at least not this one.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I enjoyed a pig roast in Tahiti. I skied breathtaking runs in the Canadian Rockies and toasted on the beaches of Mexico. I cherish the time I spent in Budapest with my family, tearing up quietly as I witnessed my dad feeling full connection with his ancestors. I played in London twice with new friends, and also by myself, soloing in another country for the first time. A dear colleague and I failed BRILLIANTLY in Toronto during a presentation. I’d like to forget that trip. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I partied away one September afternoon in Spain, stuffing myself with paella and sherry after a long hike. On the other side of the Atlantic, the twin towers fell, taking a much-adored co-worker with them. Later that evening, I stood with my fellow travelers, speechless, in a dusty train station watching the replay on television. We had missed it all. I realized right then what they mean when they say “Lonely Planet.” 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Oh, the places our planet has gone in those 10 years! As I ruffle the pages, I remember the emergence of many wonders. Who expected TiVo, domain names for $3.99, online dating, <i>What the Bleep</i>, phones that take pictures and check your email, reality TV, music downloads and iPods. Google as a verb…really? Texting and blogging and Skype, oh my! 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here in the U.S., we’ve seen the rise and fall of Britney Spears, and the fall and rise of Robert Downey Jr. We’ve also become more aware of the rise in global temperature. Hopefully, we’ll see the fall! We have new characters to talk about, real and imaginary: Monica Lewinsky, Austin Powers, Michael Moore, Paris Hilton, Karl Rove, Steven Colbert and Tony Soprano, to name a few. There are Wi-Fi stations in the airports, Botox injections in people’s foreheads and important Omega-3 fatty acids in our foods. (They’re <i>essential</i>. Who knew?) 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">How could the happy 1997 face on my passport have known that she—along with the world—would watch the stock markets crash and the deaths of Princess Diana, John Kennedy Jr. and Mother Teresa? We’d be part of the start of a new millennium (all without much incident, after all). Many of us would stand rooted in our disbelief, as the U.S. government swung radically to the right, and later began to feel the back-beat of relief from the left as we struggled for balance. We would find ourselves in a war we can‘t seem to get out of and watch an entire city dissolve in a hurricane while we were tragically late to the rescue. We would witness the horrific reality of a tsunami. We would cry and cheer for millions of people, on thousands of occasions, all at a pace and an in-your-face level of exposure we have never before experienced. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here’s the other thing the woman on the passport didn’t know. She didn’t yet know about Co-Active coaching and leadership, and this amazing global community of people that she would soon encounter. She didn’t have any idea that she would find her life’s work, along with so many others, committed to truth and honoring values and not wimping out on what‘s important. She didn’t know that she would discover something even more incredible than the Internet. She would find that there was a “worldwide web” of <i>people</i> who wanted just one thing: the glorious, full living of life. She never expected that there was a profession devoted to seeking out the sheer aliveness that comes from just being the person you really are: one devoted to the feelings that come from stretching, trying, failing, recovering, hugging, being curious, accepting and celebrating. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And the best part of all is that during a decade of time when she might have decided that the world was dark and dangerous and maybe even ending, she didn’t have to decide that. She learned she could choose to believe that it is perfect as it is. She’s become so much more aware of the good that exists in it already. The world is right as it is. What a gift! What a relief!
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Excitement.</b> It’s time to put the old blue book into the envelope now. And, it’s time to dream up the future. What lies between the pages of the fresh new passport that is coming my way? Where will it go? What will it see? 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And what about yours? Sometime soon, take out your passport. Thumb through the pages and remember where you’ve been. Take some time to think about where your community, country and world have been. If you don’t have a passport, maybe it’s time to get one. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Then hop aboard for the next 10 years. It think it’s going to be a wild trip, don‘t you? I’m <span style="margin: 30 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0707/musing0707-w.jpg" width="141" height="158" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b></span>glad we’re traveling together. (I get the aisle seat!)
