As such, she was starting to feel a sameness that was eating away at her. The demands were considerable at home, as well, so a promotion with more hours wasn’t appealing at this time.

     The Enneagram is just one of many personality typing systems that people have devised in order to better understand themselves and others. Don Riso, a noted Enneagram teacher and developer, has defined the Enneagram as “a geometric figure that delineates the nine basic personality types of human nature and their complex relationships.” The Enneagram is a useful tool for understanding oneself and others because it focuses not only upon types of behavior but it is also concerned with underlying attitudes, emotional reactions, conscious and unconscious motivations, as well as spiritual potentials.

10-11 a.m. Pacific, 6-7 p.m. GMT</font><br>

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">The Gremlin is a concept developed by Richard Carson that embodies a group of thought processes and feelings that serve to maintain the status quo in our lives. Often operating as a structure that would seem to protect us, the Gremlin, in fact, keeps us from moving forward and getting what we truly want in life. Like our mind, the Gremlin will always be with us. It is neither good nor bad; it just is. The Gremlin loses its power over us when we can identify it for what it is, notice our options in the situation and then consciously choose what it is we really want at the time.    
      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for training, but an enhancement, designed to help everyone deepen the learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome--whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, are in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or perhaps have been doing this for years and would like to have a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you.

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Holding the client's agenda is both a philosophical stance and a cornerstone in the Co-Active model. When coaches hold the client’s agenda, they let go of their own opinions, judgments and answers in support of facilitating the client's fulfillment, balance and process. Coaches follow the client’s lead without knowing the right answer, giving solutions or telling the client what to do. Holding the client's agenda requires coaches to put their whole attention on the client and his/her agenda, not on their own agenda for the client.

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">The Intuition Niche invites you to explore your intuition! How does it show up for you? What strengthens it? (And what debilitates it?) When do you trust it? And, when do you trust it with your clients?! Share your learning and learn from others in a lively, intuitive exploration!

      <p class="bodyverdana11" style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Come join this vibrant community at Josephine Wither's interesting home in Accokeek, MD. Her home was recently featured on HGTV! Bring your summertime spirit and enjoy the laid-back approach of Co-Active networking. We're opening this meeting to a "come when you can" attitude to make traveling 20 minutes south of the Beltway and the Wilson Bridge as easy as possible. If there’s a gathering a bit away from town that is worth attending, this one is IT! Hope you can come. Carpooling is a great idea—you can enjoy the ride with a Co-Active buddy! Directions to Josephine's home will be sent after you register.
