As such, she was starting to feel a sameness that was eating away at her. The demands were considerable at home, as well, so a promotion with more hours wasn’t appealing at this time. Maybe her situation wouldn’t be that bad if it weren’t for the sense of sameness to her days that felt so, so empty.

    <p>Dear J.S.:<br>
     The Enneagram is just one of many personality typing systems that people have devised in order to better understand themselves and others. Don Riso, a noted Enneagram teacher and developer, has defined the Enneagram as “a geometric figure that delineates the nine basic personality types of human nature and their complex relationships.” The Enneagram is a useful tool for understanding oneself and others because it focuses not only upon types of behavior but it is also concerned with underlying attitudes, emotional reactions, conscious and unconscious motivations, as well as spiritual potentials.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">A goal is an outcome that the client would like to achieve. Goals are most helpful when they are measurable, specific, are owned by the client, have a date by which they will be accomplished, are made public (in order to achieve support and accountability), and constitute a reasonable stretch for the client.      
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This group forum is not a replacement for training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, are in the middle of Certification and wish to explore them deeper, or have been doing this for years and would like a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Last month, we heard about six simple and powerful steps to selling effectively and comfortably from Carol Costello, author of The Soul of Selling: How to Achieve Extraordinary Results with Remarkable Ease. We hope that you have obtained her book and begun to practice the steps. This month, we would like to share our in-the-moment learning. What is working and where are we continuing to be stuck? What are we learning about ourselves as we engage in this process to build new relationships with the people in organizations that we want to have as clients? How are you experiencing the selling process from Carol’s perspective? Let’s come together around this approach and see where it goes. If you haven’t obtained her book yet, we encourage you to do so either through Amazon.com or directly from her if you want an autographed copy: <a href="http://www.soulofselling.com" class="orange">www.soulofselling.com</a>. <http://www.soulofselling.com> Even if you haven't read her book, we are sure you will enjoy this discussion.
