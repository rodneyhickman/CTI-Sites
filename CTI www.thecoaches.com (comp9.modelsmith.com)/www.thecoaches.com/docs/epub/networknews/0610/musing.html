	     by Jill  McCullogh, Cambridgshire, UK </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0610/geo1.jpg" width="108" height="83" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The  European Co-Active Community Day&mdash;Harrington Hall Hotel, London&mdash;Friday, the 12th  of May, 2006</i> </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&ldquo;Where are  my feet, where&rsquo;s my butt?&rdquo;&nbsp;This, I thought, gazing at the kind and cuddly  form of Karen Kimsey-House, is <i>not</i> the leader of an international cult.</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On a  bright, sunny day, I found myself zinging with anticipation as I entered the  somewhat cave-like, windowless innards of the hotel conference room. I had  expected the huge throng that had been there last October, but this, it seemed,  was to be a more intimate affair of maybe 40 in all. </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We all bang  on about the magic of Co-Activity, but it <b><i>is</i></b> that energy of  passion, possibility and unconditional giving that fills the room and acts as a  shot in the arm. That&rsquo;s why<i> I</i> was there. Networking extensively, as many  of us do, I&rsquo;m sure, I never get the same vibration. Indeed, before I did my  coach training with CTI, I wouldn&rsquo;t have even known what to look for!&nbsp;I  recently attended a meeting of the Professional Speakers Association; boy, did <i>that</i> feel different!</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Kyle  Newman, our host, brought us all into the meeting and our intentions were set  for the day in true Co-Active style. Hushed, nodded comments of &ldquo;the importance  of bringing this work to the world&rdquo; always have my &ldquo;down-to-earth&rdquo; saboteurs  leaping up and down. Indeed, Karen mentioned that on a recent course, a member  had queried CTI&rsquo;s cult status. Yes, of course, if the whole world had a Co-Active  coach, it would be a better place, but let us not hold our CTI leaders as  gurus. They are only human, and we are not &ldquo;less than,&rdquo; merely fledgling in our  brilliance. Karen certainly does not hold herself in that exalted, worshipful  position. She is an expert, inspiring and generous with her knowledge, but  real, and her method for getting present and connected at the top of the page  says it all!</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The morning  was spent in the safe hands of Karen and Kyle, who danced playfully together  giving us &ldquo;Co-Active Magic and Workshop Wizardry&rdquo; and, given Karen&rsquo;s timeframe,  gave a perfect example of how you can put together a workshop over a glass of  wine if you know your stuff. </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The session  was BRILLIANT, the hand-outs an invaluable reminder&hellip;<b><i>and</i></b> it was a  slow burn. It wasn&rsquo;t until three days later that I woke up with a brilliant  business idea full of inspiration, which had all been fed from that workshop. </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The central  position was to hold the big picture of the workshop, not to get bogged down in  the details. Once you have established who you want to make a difference with,  it is about satisfying their hunger. Underneath all that, the real core to the  piece is the <b>stake</b>: What is  the ultimate point of you running the workshop? What do you want them to be  left with? &ldquo;For the sake of what?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This was a  piece of re-learning that resonated on so many levels for me and now underpins  almost every meaningful conversation and business meeting I have in my life. As  a big-picture person, I get dangerously distracted (and bored) by the detail. I  have always set intentions of what to get out of a business meeting, but this  is different. This is a way of giving focus to any workshop, indeed any meeting,  in a powerful way. By the way, it&rsquo;s also handy in handling sophisticated bed-time  avoidance techniques!</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">OK, so we  were then sent out in pairs to brainstorm creating the workshop&mdash;not the when,  where and &ldquo;how the hell will I market this?&rdquo; but the passion, the stake upon which  the workshop is based. The aha&rsquo;s came thick and fast, with Karen and Kyle  floating around giving advice and inspiration. Somehow, clarifying the stake  connected us to our life purpose, shaking off the gremlin and making the  business details quite manageable.</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Having said  that, with a brilliant piece of intuition, Karen came to me and answered  questions that had sabotaged my workshops for a year:&nbsp;&ldquo;You want three  hours minimum, at least 10 people. Debrief. Break it down. Create the learning.  Introduce a new learning piece. Point them on their way.&rdquo; In 15 seconds, Karen  sat on my saboteurs and sent me on my way. </p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We returned  to the group to digest the learning, covering topics such as resistant groups.  Every act is a cry for learning&mdash;&ldquo;Hungry to learn but just don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo; I  need to be flexible enough to meet them and speak to the learner. We shared  ideas on getting over nervousness, from tree-hugging (no, really!) to making a  fool of yourself early on to get it out of the way!&nbsp;I was personally taken  by a saboteur-busting phrase: &ldquo;Who the hell am I to judge myself?!&rdquo;</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After a  long lunch in the blazing hot sun, we returned for the afternoon session. This  began with hot-seat coaching provided by Mandy, with Lulu as the coachee. This  was breathtaking in its use of geography and took me out of my comfort zone as  a coach, reminding us of the &ldquo;fierce courage&rdquo; that can be so important in  coaching. Having been to ICF hot-seat coaching sessions, it once again  demonstrated for me the brilliance of Co-Active coaches.</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This was  followed by Damien Churton and Joseph Seller, and &ldquo;Your Natural Way to Get Clients&rdquo; workshop. Having  already taken this course, it was delightful to meet Damien and Joseph in  person, and the refresher was great. The basis for their programme of telephone  workshops is the fact that we all try to follow the instructions of &ldquo;experts&rdquo; for  how to get clients, shutting off our own natural way. The lively session  abounded with gardening metaphors and bubbled with exchange and laughter.  Whether you were a flower or a bee, the transparent learning was quite a  relief!&nbsp;When you notice and follow your natural way, then you sow seeds,  nurture them and are on hand to help them bloom so that you can harvest!</p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">All in all,  an extremely enjoyable day, learning, laughing and meeting people for the first  time that I feel I have known for years! Don&rsquo;t miss the next one!</p>
	    <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">Love,</p>
