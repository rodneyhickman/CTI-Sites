        <i>This is not a specific  question about my coaching practice but one of a more general nature. What do  you recommend in terms of professional development? </i><br>
        <i>&mdash;D.P.</i></p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear D.P.:<br>
	    This is an excellent question and one that all coaches who  consider themselves part of the profession should ponder seriously. I don&rsquo;t  know where you are in your coaching training. Are you just beginning or are you  currently certified? Regardless of whether you are a novice coach or a  certified coach, professional and personal development will serve you.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is my personal and professional bias that the most  powerful form of professional development is personal development. As coaching  has grown and attracted more people to the profession, a wider array of people  interested in coaching have come to be trained. Some people have rigorously  worked on their own personal growth, while others have yet to begin.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">To be masterful, it is important to know yourself. This  knowledge will help you succeed in your own life, and it will help you more  deeply understand your clients&rsquo; experiences. Not only should you know what your  strong points are but also the obstacles that stop you from moving forward.  What does it take for you to be with an obstacle and ultimately pass through  it? What is your growing edge? How often do you live there?</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have noticed that coaches who have serious spiritual  practices or have engaged in ongoing periods of personal growth and exploration  often have deeper access to the naturally creative, resourceful and whole parts  of themselves than those coaches who have not availed themselves of these  opportunities. It is helpful to either have a teacher, mentor, therapist or  coach who will hold you accountable for your inner work. Other people use  learning groups or their spiritual community to support this growth. For a  year-long immersion into group learning, CTI&rsquo;s Leadership Program offers one  such avenue.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you are just at the beginning of your training, doing the  five courses in the&nbsp; <br>
       Co-Active Coaching Program and the Co-Active Coach  Certification Program will serve you well. Even if you have had comparable  training in other areas, you will gain much from both the curriculum and the  Co-Active community. The Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching courses  are also excellent and can provide a significant deepening of your learning. If  you have taken all the courses that CTI has to offer, continue to look for  courses that train you to perform competently in your particular niche. If you  are coaching lawyers, for example, it can be helpful to keep abreast of the  current trends and issues in the legal profession. Another area of professional  growth is business training. Marketing oneself requires a different skill set  than coaching. To be a successful external coach, it is important to know how  to appropriately market yourself. Coaches who work internally can grow  professionally by studying the field of expertise in which their corporation  specializes. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The ICF offers various coaching programs via teleconference,  in person during chapter meetings and at the annual conventions. The value of  taking an ICF course is that you will be exposed to other schools of thought  and practice. As you become more proficient in your practice of Co-Active coaching,  it can be helpful to mix and match tools from different schools, depending upon  the needs of your client.</p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Finally, there is no substitute for ongoing supervision.  Whether you choose to hire a supervisor for individual work or to join a  supervision group, your learning and your practice will continue to grow. While  getting your CPCC represents a commitment to your growth and learning, it  should not be seen as a termination to your coaching education. True mastery  lives in ongoing growth and practice. While you can often learn on your own,  you can learn more from having an outside source of information and feedback  whose job it is to guide you toward increasing your competence and deepening  your coaching impact. </p>
	   <p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><i>Dear Judith, </i><br>
         <i>I had a conversation  with one of my clients last week and it left me with a question of boundaries.  Although we don&rsquo;t generally talk politics, he casually mentioned that he was  not going to vote in the upcoming 2006 American elections in November. He is so  disenchanted with the government that he wants nothing to do with either party.  My immediate response was to encourage him to vote. He argued with me and I  backed off. However, I am left wondering how to handle political discussions  with a client.</i><br>
       <i>&mdash;E.R.H.</i></p>
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear E.R.H.: <br>
	    Assuming that you are holding your client&rsquo;s agenda and not  promoting your own political agenda, discussing politics can provide a very  fruitful coaching discussion. The most important aspect of this coaching is to  remain curious and unattached to any particular political outcome. My personal  opinion is that people in the United States have become so charged around  political discussions that it is hard to deeply listen to the other person&rsquo;s  point of view without inserting our own opinions. Self-management will also be  a key component of a successful coaching interaction.
	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What I hear your client expressing in his decision not to  vote is his obvious disappointment with his government. I am curious to know  how he has dealt with disappointment in other situations in his life. What has  he learned about disappointment and his response to it? Is disengagement the  only response that he has? What would other responses look like? If he has  tried other responses, what were his experiences? It&rsquo;s important to ask these  questions from a truly curious space and not from hoping to subtly manipulate  him into voting. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Disappointment might be one feeling that he has. He might  also be feeling hopeless and that is why he wants to opt out. Again, let him  speak his deep experience and connect with him on that level. Once he fully  owns the depth of his own feelings, he might still decide not to vote or he  might decide to act in ways that can rebuild his hope. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I see opportunities for you to discuss this issue using all  three of the Co-Active principles. If you do Fulfillment coaching with him, you  can look at his values. What values is he honoring or not honoring by voting or  not voting? What does his Saboteur have to say about this issue? You can also  look for input from his Future Self, as well as that of the United States. In  terms of Balance coaching, what is his current perspective and what are other  possible perspectives that he can stand in regarding his relationship with his  government? What is he saying yes to and what is he saying no to? What is he  committed to? And finally, Process coaching can allow him to go deeply into  both his positive and negative feelings. It sounds like there will be lots to  discuss and discover in mining his disenchantment and his original hopes and  desires. 
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Rather than suggesting that he vote in November, you can  offer him a chance to express his political voice and feelings right now. Don&rsquo;t  stop until you get all of it. Let him hear and feel the power of his emotion  and let him feel your engagement. After all, isn&rsquo;t that what democracy and  politics are truly about?
