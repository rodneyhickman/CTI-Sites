	<p> Co-Active coaching was brought to Norway in the fall of 1999. So far, more than 300 inspired students have gone through the various CTI training courses! A lot of us felt this was so good and needed to have more, so we signed up for CTI&rsquo;s certification program. </p>
	<p> Eva S&oslash;gnebotten, the third CPCC in Norway , initiated in October 2003 the CPCC Alliance Norway (hereafter referred to as the Alliance ). Her motivation was to have a network to support certified coaches and help coaches through the certification program, in addition to being an arena for further development as a coach after certification. The main importance was to be a support network also for coaches outside our capital Oslo , where most of the other networks are present. </p>	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The CPCC Alliance Norway was founded October 10, 2003 .<strong></strong>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Vision </strong><br>Our vision is:<br>•  To be an arena of learning and evolving for the members of the Alliance    <br>
	•  To contribute to professionalizing co-active coaching in Norway<br> 
• To contribute to the development of co-active coaching in Norway
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This vision is intended to support all of us in our development as Co-Active coaches and in supplying quality services to our clients.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Membership</strong><br>To join the Alliance you need to be a CPCC, or at least have your certification application approved by CTI. This is an exclusive Alliance for Co-Active coaches only. However, we encourage our members to join other coaching networks and we especially work with the Co-Active coaching network in Norway (<a class=orange href="http://www.cacnettverket.no">www.cacnettverket.no</a>). So far, we are 22 certified coaches in the Alliance and three are still in the certification program. 

	<p> We are just so pleased that membership is increasing and that the up-and-coming CTI-trained coaches are seeing the benefit of being certified. We connect with potential members by visiting the brown-bag lunches during the CTI courses. Our members truly come from all walks of life and function as coaches in many different ways. We have coaches who work as internal coaches in their organizations. We have coaches who combine coaching and various forms of alternative therapy. And, we have many &quot;hard-core&quot; Co-Active coaches who solely make a living on coaching, having started their own practices. </p>
	<p><strong> Meetings </strong><br>
	We meet virtually once a month on a phone conference the first Monday of every month, from 13.00&ndash;14.00. Every month a new topic. So far, the following topics have been discussed: <br>
	•  A virtual organisation—an exiting challenge<br>
•  The exam—and preparing for it<br>
•  The use of our website<br>
•  How to continuously develop as a coach<br>
•  Experiences from the Nordic Coach Conference<br>
•  The greatest challenges as a coach—from both “do” and “be” perspectives<br>
•  CTI leadership expansion in Europe<br>
•  Experiences in using the future-self visualisation<br>
•  What it means to be a Co-Active coach<br>
•  Humanity within an organization<br>
•  Where coaching is different to forms of conversational therapy</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><strong>Annual Conference</strong><br>The Alliance wants to physically meet at least once a year. We, therefore, have an Annual Conference. In 2004, it was held in Bergen, October 15–16. We use the power and competence within the Alliance to fill the agenda of the conference, using our members’ brilliant ideas, coaching techniques or skills, interesting perspectives or anything that could be of interest to our group. This year’s theme was “Playful and Courageous.”

	<p style="margin: 10 0 20 0"><strong>Website</strong><br>See our website: <a class=orange href="http://www.cpcc.no">www.cpcc.no</a>. 
We have developed a website, describing a bit about the Alliance. It also contains a list of all our members with a link to each member’s e-mail address, websites and CV. Our members cover Norway from North to South, West to East. In addition, we share documentation, articles, photos and correspondence on a Yahoo website where all the members have access. Our common mail-group ensures that we easily reach every member with our various questions and information to share. Our Alliance is a place to grow and learn, a place where people not only have access to practical support, but also feel held in their process.
 <p style="margin: 10 0 20 0"><strong>The board</strong><br> Our board is represented by: May Britt Slaaen-Tombre, leader; Vibeke Thunes Olsen, deputy leader/web manager; Vivi Ann Larsen; and Anne Markgren.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 20 0"><strong>Groupwork</strong><br> The rest of the members will be divided into groups, working with a topic about which each feels compassionate. For example: <br>
 •  Experience transfer<br>
•  Developing the Alliance
•  Public relations/articles/promotions <br>
•  European Coach Conference 2005<br>
•  Next annual conference<br>
•  Ensuring interesting topics for our virtual meetings<br>
•  Co-work with other networks
