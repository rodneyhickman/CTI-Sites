	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hello and Welcome!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This month’s <em>Co-Active Network News</em> is once again filled with great resources. It’s a pleasure being able to “put it all together” for you. We’re re-naming niches, adding niches, adding geographical communities and even re-igniting some—all very exciting!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have a wonderful Main Community event coming this month. Leza Danly, founder of Lucid Living and keynote speaker for this year’s European ICF Conference will be leading a call on “Coaching an Awakening World.” Seems like one <u>not</u> to miss. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In this issue, we’ll see what’s happening with our Social Action niche, we’ll get to read about our northern friends from Norway, and we have a delightful and poignant Musing from member Mary Reynolds Thompson, CPCC. Of course, who could forget our “Dear Judith?” Judith Cohen nails it again with her in-depth responses to our curious members, a great value for many of you, I’m sure.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Take a good look through the calendar and pick that special event(s) you’d like to attend and sign up to attend soon. We’ve been filling events to capacity. Also, to those of you(s) who muse, please submit them to me at <a class=orange href= "mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> and put<img src="/networknews/0502/images/1Andrew%20Editorial.jpg" width="60" height="91" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt=""> Co-Active Newsletter Musing in the title.

I was inspired to become a co-leader for this niche because of the fascinating intersection of service and prosperity and the opportunities this opens up for learning and creativity. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a brand new co-leader of this niche, I am no expert—nor do I want to be. And I know this to be true about all the people on our team. As a community of Co-Active coaches, we want to encourage people to be co-active and co-creative with us. 
 	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The CTI Social Action niche is a lively community that organizes monthly events, either via conference call or in person in a variety of states. (Check our calendar for events!) Initiatives are being developed from this niche community that are exciting and creative and call us forth to be leaders who think abundantly, lovingly and bridge the gap between service and financial sustainability.	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><a class="orange" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?293@77.MYFdaDFCe8j.84@.3c40b91f">Read the full article here.</a>

     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> I first heard about The Coaching Salon over the CTI Yahoo group when Carol Ross posted this wonderful model she was using to bring coaching to the world. I was immediately inspired and jumped at the chance to work with her. Since then, Carol, Patricia Michel and I have created The Coaching Salon niche community, which was unveiled November 2004 and now&mdash;less than two months later&mdash;has more 60 members in the United States and abroad.      
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> As coaches, we know that our work can change the world, so I figured why not get some group energy going and see what kind of broader impact we can make. With this in mind, I put forth a challenge that coaches from all over the world come together and create Coaching Salons on January 8, 2005 . Several coaches have signed up to take this challenge. <br>

So far, more than 300 <img src="/networknews/0502/images/4Vibeke%20Geo.jpg" width="80" height="96" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">inspired students have gone through the various CTI training courses! A lot of us felt this was so good and needed to have more, so we signed up for CTI&rsquo;s certification program. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Eva Søgnebotten, the third CPCC in Norway, initiated in October 2003 the CPCC Alliance Norway (hereafter referred to as the Alliance). Her motivation was to have a network to support certified coaches and help coaches through the certification program, in addition to being an arena for further development as a coach after certification. The main importance was to be a support network also for coaches outside our capital Oslo, where most of the other networks are present.

During an animated conversation about creativity with an art therapist, this lovely woman turned her suddenly serious eyes on me and said, “Our problem is that we are born into a pre-imagined world.” 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">	  As Co-Active coaches we hold our clients as creative, resourceful and whole. Creative is the first word to appear in the four cornerstones of co-active coaching. It is the first stake we put into the ground, and it is a bold and marvelous stand against a world that would often steal our imaginations from us.	  
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">Clients come to us in a crisis of creativity. They feel stuck, uncertain. They are often in relationships and careers “pre-imagined” for them by others: parents, peers, religious and educational institutions. They don’t like where they are, but they are unable to envision where they are headed. They may even be suspicious of creativity, believing that it belongs to just the few, like the writers and artists. Nothing could be further from the truth.

	<strong>January 2005 Network News</strong>
	<p>How is everyone? Actually, the question is: Who is everyone? This month&rsquo;s Wizardry article focuses on being seen. Literally. We&rsquo;re talking about the profile functionality on the Network. For those of you who have taken a CTI course, you will be prompted to complete an extended profile. If you have not, you will be able to leave all of your contact information. Both scenarios allow you to post your photo, however. When I click on a member&rsquo;s name and the picture pops up, I instantly feel warmth and connection. Plus, I love seeing who you are. I actually feel closer to you when I see your image.</p>
	<p>When you click &ldquo;edit profile&rdquo; in the left nav bar, you will see the option to &ldquo;browse&rdquo; a file on your computer. The system needs a .jpg photo file to be able to upload properly. Your picture should not exceed 125 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide, and be no larger than 40K. Go ahead and give it a try even if the parameters do not match this specific measurement, as the system has a built-in re-size feature up to a certain limit.</p>
	<p>If after you try this it&rsquo;s still not working, email the file to <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> (me) and I&rsquo;ll work my magic on it.</p>
	<p>This may be a great opportunity for learning: Ask a friend with a digital camera to have a photo shoot with you. You may be able to create a glamour day and honor your value of self-care, beauty, playfulness and even visibility. Hmmmm, might be fun! Let&rsquo;s see those smiling faces everyone!</p>
	<p>And now for a follow-up to last month&rsquo;s article. We have been in communication with our designers with quite a list of improvements and enhancements. Some changes may start to creep in as you travel through the Co-Active Network in the future. If you have any questions, please let me know at the email address above. I&rsquo;m happy to assist you.</p>

	  <p><em>Dear Judith:</em><img src="/networknews/0502/images/judith.jpg" width="88" height="123" align="right"><br><em>I am curious to know what is CTI&rsquo;s model about ADHD. Can I find any matter about this subject on the CTI site? </em><br>
	  <em>Regards, </em><br>
	    <em>S. A. </em>
	  <p>Dear S. A.: <br> CTI doesn&rsquo;t have a specific model for ADHD. The Co-Active Coaching model holds all people &ldquo;naturally creative, resourceful and whole.&rdquo; One of the main cornerstones of the Co-Active Coaching model is that coaches coach their client&rsquo;s whole life. We see the person first rather than their diagnosis. In my experience of working with adults with ADHD, I have found that each one of them has suffered at some point from the stigma of being labeled as a problem. The first piece of work to be done is to separate the person from the interpretation of ADHD as a problem. One of the gifts of the Co-Active Coaching model is to turn this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; into something that can actually work for the client rather than being seen only as a deficit. </p>
	  <p>Within that context, it is important for the client and the coach to design an alliance that specifically works for the client. Symptoms such as impulsivity, lack of focus, inability to finish projects can be dealt with by creating the client&rsquo;s awareness of his or her impact, structures to focus their attention and lots of accountability. Above and beyond that, each person with ADHD has his or her own Big A agenda (their life vision, who they wish to become). I have found that focusing on what people most deeply desire in their lives also serves to help manage some of their symptoms.  </p>
