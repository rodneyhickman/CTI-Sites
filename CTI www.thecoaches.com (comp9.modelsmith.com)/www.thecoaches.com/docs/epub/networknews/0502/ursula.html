	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src=http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0502/images/ursula.jpg width="80" height="119" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">When I think about coaching and Social Action, the first thing that comes to mind is bringing coaching to non-traditional coaching arenas (or to people who normally couldn’t afford coaching!). I was inspired to become a co-leader for this niche because of the fascinating intersection of service and prosperity and the opportunities this opens up for learning and creativity. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a brand new co-leader of this niche, I am no expert—nor do I want to be. And I know this to be true about all the people on our team. As a community of Co-Active coaches, we want to encourage people to be co-active and co-creative with us. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The CTI Social Action niche is a lively community that organizes monthly events, either via conference call or in person in a variety of states. (Check our calendar for events!) Initiatives are being developed from this niche community that are exciting and creative and call us forth to be leaders who think abundantly, lovingly and bridge the gap between service and financial sustainability.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Although our calls are educational and informative, we are also wanting to create action and forward movement from these calls. This takes your leadership and involvement.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I, personally, see amazing possibilities to co-create projects and programs that span the United States and the globe. We are not limited anymore to being in one location to bring about change. In this niche community we want to gather people from all parts of the world, knit together different approaches to the same causes so that we can impact the world on a bigger and wider scale, for the highest good of all. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Minnesota’s AmeriCoach is a great example for innovative ways to bring coaching to a wider audience—in this case young people between 20-25 years of age who serve in Americorps, as well as staff of Americorps programs and, in a separate program, mentor/teachers in Intermediate School District 287. The creation of a non-profit as a vehicle to bring leadership training and coaching to young service-minded people has enabled the founders to be financially successful, as well as contributing in a powerful and impactful way. It spreads the word about coaching and makes it accessible.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I am sure that there are many more examples. The Social Action niche community is a place where you can bring your ideas and your vision, where we can support one another to make things happen.
