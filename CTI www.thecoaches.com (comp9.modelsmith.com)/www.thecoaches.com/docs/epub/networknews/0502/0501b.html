	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Welcome to 2005!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As I reflect on the year that has passed, I wonder how I could ever have imagined what was in store for me, for CTI and for the world way back in January 2004. I am continually in awe of what has happened. We celebrated, we mourned, we accomplished, we failed, we got grounded, and we were given the opportunity to create something next, something new. The piece here, for me, is do I REALLY know all that is coming? It's quite exciting, and I'm in the best company to experience it. Let's lock our virtual arms together and embrace our future(s) together! Welcome to 2005!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'm excited about this month's news. It's our inaugural issue featuring the new section,  "Ask Judith." Anyone provided an answer by Judith Cohen will surely be served in a huge way. We ALL will be. Thanks, Judith! 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have a thriving new niche as you can see by all of the events it has posted for January: The Coaching Salon niche is becoming one success story after another. Also, I invited Akasha Halsey, President of the Marin Coaches Alliance ICF Chapter, to submit an article for our Geographic section. Akasha has once again rallied her neighboring ICF chapters here in the San Francisco Bay Area to create a tantalizing event with the acclaimed poet, David Whyte, which brings me to this month's Musing. I wanted David to write us a special piece for the Musing section, and I ended up with a wonderful article that I was able to get permission to print for you. It resonates for me. I know you'll enjoy it. Dive in.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Let's get this year started!	
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Much love and happiness to you,

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>The Coaching Salon</b>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0501/carol.jpg" width="82" height="109" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">I have been playing with a forum I created, The Coaching Salon, over the last six months. Turns out it's not a new name. Someone under the auspices of Coachville has been using that name for several years, with a similar bent on helping others learn about coaching through a shared experience of observing live coaching. Even the act of watching someone else demonstrate a discipline is not new. Think cooking shows, home remodeling shows and black belt demonstrations at the local karate studio. What is new is the way in which The Coaching Salon transforms the participants as well as the observers. Here's how it works:
	<ol type="1">
	<li>A volunteer from the audience is coached for 12 minutes by a professional coach-someone who is trained as a coach.
	<li>There is at least one other person observing the coaching and preferably more, including other professional coaches.
	<li>Feedback follows each coaching. The volunteer client gives the first feedback and then the audience is invited to provide feedback.
	<li>This cycle of coaching with feedback is repeated twice, each time with a different volunteer and different coach.
</ol>
   	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Sometimes, it's not clear what you have on your hands until someone else tries out your idea. A friend tried out The Coaching Salon in another part of the country. She did it with another coaching colleague. In the process of accommodating her colleague, this friend played and stretched the form of The Coaching Salon-from 12 to 15 minutes, coaching one-on-one instead of in front of others, guaranteeing confidentiality where it could not be guaranteed. And of course without observers, there could be no feedback. I'm fortunate to have this friend. She taught me what was important about The Coaching Salon, those parts that are non-negotiable, by inadvertently omitting the parts that give the Salon its uniqueness.	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><a class="orange" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?293@77.MYFdaDFCe8j.84@.3c40b91f">Read the full article here.</a>

Sun, fog, hot, cool and downright nippy all in one region. There are a few oddities here, as well. One of our bridges is "golden." We can claim not one, but FOUR, chapters of the International Coach Federation. And those chapters are in an area within one hour of each other (if there's no traffic and you catch the lights right). So many coaches, so many chapters, so little time to take it all in.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That's one reason I thought it would be a good idea for the Marin Coaches Alliance to collaborate with all the other chapters in the Bay Area and do an event that was mutually beneficial to all of us. We'd get a chance to "meet" on the phone during the planning process, get to know each other from the standpoint of what we each brought to share and then have the pleasure of meeting in person at the event. We'd be able to offer our chapter members a chance to show off their talents while working for a bigger goal. And, we might possibly make some money in the process! What could be wrong with that?

	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0501/david_whyte.jpg" width="88" height="123" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">Leadership gets a great deal of emphasis these days, though as a poet I often ask myself if there is a better word, or a better avenue of enquiry than putting all of our eggs in that one basket of exploration. Leadership dominates our conversations in organizations-large, small, entrepreneurial, or academic. I am often asked: "What is the secret of leadership?" as if it were a static piece of information rather than a dynamic relationship between an individual and the world. Some believe that if you simply adopt certain traits-being decisive, taking bold risks, or articulating a clear and compelling vision of the future, you will have the very stuff of leadership. But do any of these commonly observed traits make up that magic ingredient that invites others to join or follow an individual? It is my opinion that they are not enough by themselves. They are isolated diagnostic characteristics that a given leader may have, but to my mind they are not the heart of the matter.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><strong>The Art of Conversation</strong><br>At the very heart of leadership-indeed, at its very soul-is the art of <em>conversation</em>, the ability to create a dialogue that others will willingly join. Any good conversation extends an implicit invitation for those who join it to meet at some as yet indefinable frontier, and through that joining to be part of the process of defining that new frontier. The best conversations make clear distinctions between what has gone before and what is now possible. They give the sense that we are part of something that is enlarging us or our organization rather than confining us.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Dear Judith: </em><br><em>I have a client who answers me with "I don't know," whenever I ask her a powerful question. I don't know what to do. </em><br><em>W. A. </em>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear W.A. <br>Wow, I don't know either! Don't worry, I'm just kidding…. Actually, not knowing is really a great place to be. When you don't know, there are tons of opportunities to practice curiosity, beginner's mind and creating in the moment.  
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here are a few ideas that you can try: 
	<li>Get curious about the part of your client who doesn't know the answer. Invite that part of her to have a conversation with you. </li>
	<li>What DOES your client know? She's got to know something. </li>
	<li>Have your client pretend that she does know, and have her make up several answers in the moment. It doesn't matter whether she thinks her responses are right or not. We make stuff up all the time including the fact that we don't know. Be playful about it and see if anything rings true for her. </li>
	<li>Let your client suggest her own questions that might work for her. </li>
	<li>Just to be creative, ask her gremlin to answer the question and see what comes up. You might find a powerful answer here. </li>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">One other notion to consider is that sometimes people immediately answer, "I don't know," because they haven't yet taken the time to explore the question. For some people, it's like saying, "Um," or "Uh." It's a chance to pause and buy time to consider the question. The next time your client says, "I don't know," let her know that she can take some time to consider your question. If it's a powerful question, it deserves some good attention on her part. Be patient and wait. Trust that she is naturally creative, resourceful and whole, and is capable of coming up with an answer that works for her. <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&nbsp;</p>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'd like to start off by saying, Thank You! to all of you who have been vigilant in <strong>managing your email</strong> accounts on the Network. Seems we're getting better and yet you can count on me to hold the bar high on this one. The trick, I assert, is in remembering all the places your email is connected to on any given day, especially when you're trying to tie down all those loose ends before you go away from your computer for a weekend getaway, business trip or extended vacation. Well, the Co-Active Network is one of those loose ends to tighten up before you leave. This seems to show up across the board and mostly with our corporate friends who enable "auto reply" on their email accounts. Please remember to go to "Manage Account" and select "no mail" or simply un-check all the boxes to the right of your communities in which you belong. <em>Helpful Hint: Put a sticky note on your computer screen as a structure to remember that the Co-Active Network is impacted by your auto replies.</em>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You may have noticed that some of your discussions that promote services and opportunities have disappeared on the Main Community discussions list. Don't panic, I've moved them to the <strong>Promos</strong> thread. This is now the place to post all of your fantastic opportunities. If you're selling, you're promoting. Simple eh? This allows the receiver to choose. A much better impact indeed!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ever been one to look for a <strong>bridgeline</strong> for a specific event on the Network? Here's a couple of tips for you. First, go to the event description posted on the calendar. It may have been added to the description closer to the date of the event. In some cases, it's posted there at the time the event was created. Second, if it's quite a bit of time before the event, say five days or more, you may need to simply wait and see if you receive an email from the organizer closer to the date of the event. And third, this is usually saved for those desperate, last minute, "Oh my gosh, what's the number?" times: send an urgent email to the organizer of the community or post a discussion in the community of origin. Let me explain this last piece. Most all events except "Main Events" are generated in a particular Niche or Geographic community. Post your urgent plea to the community of origin. There is a link at the bottom of the event description to take you there. It looks like this: "This page is a pointer to this original event."
