	    <strong>Pre-Imagined Life to the Re-Imagined Life</strong>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><img src="/networknews/0502/images/5Musing.JPG" width="149" height="112" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">Last weekend I heard a phrase that struck deep into my bones. During an animated conversation about creativity with an art therapist, this lovely woman turned her suddenly serious eyes on me and said, &ldquo;Our problem is that we are born into a pre-imagined world.&rdquo;
      <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">      
      As Co-Active coaches we hold our clients as creative, resourceful and whole. Creative is the first word to appear in the four cornerstones of co-active coaching. It is the first stake we put into the ground, and it is a bold and marvelous stand against a world that would often steal our imaginations from us.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">Clients come to us in a crisis of creativity. They feel stuck, uncertain. They are often in relationships and careers &ldquo;pre-imagined&rdquo; for them by others: parents, peers, religious and educational institutions. They don&rsquo;t like where they are, but they are unable to envision where they are headed. They may even be suspicious of creativity, believing that it belongs to just the few, like the writers and artists. Nothing could be further from the truth.
      <p> The universe is always looking for a new place of creative emergence, and this is true for us, too. If we open ourselves up to what it is to be truly alive, we will always uncover new longing, new ideas, new ways of seeing and being. </p>      
      <p>Awakening to our own creativity is a radical act. It&rsquo;s saying that we have the right to participate in shaping the world about us. It&rsquo;s saying that we can imagine a different way of doing things and a different way of being. It&rsquo;s saying what springs forth from us is as vital and important and relevant as anything that is imposed upon us. </p>
      <p> In his poem “Self Portrait,” David Whyte writes: </p>     <blockquote>
        <p><em>I want to know<br>
          if you are prepared to live in the world<br>
          with its harsh need<br>
          to change you. If you can look back<br>
          with firm eyes<br>
          saying this is where I stand. 
          </em></p>      
        </blockquote>
      <p>Helping our clients connect with their creativity allows them to enter their full potential as human beings. It allows them to take a stand for the lives that they wish to create and the kinds of people they wish to be&mdash;even when the world would have them be otherwise.</p>      
      <p>But how do we connect our clients with their innate creativity?</p>
      <p>Lichtenstein wrote, &ldquo;You cannot enter any world for which you do not have the language.&rdquo; Nor can our clients enter any world that they cannot imagine or articulate. We need to find ways to open them up to the language of their imagination. We can do this with powerful questions and perspectives&mdash;and with so much more. </p>
      <p>We can invite our clients to put pen to paper and write, to move to music, to make music, to paint wildly, to dream up tales, to re-write the stories of their lives, to plant gardens and seed poems. Even more importantly, we can help them to turn off their TV sets and computers and set aside time for doing nothing but musing. Imagination needs time and space and silence to grow.</p>
      <p>The poet William Stafford writes, </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Sometimes commanders take us over, and they </em><br>
          <em>try to impose their whole universe, </em><br>
          <em> how to succeed by daily calculation: </em><br>
          <em> I can't eat that bread. </em><br>

      <p>Who is commanding your clients&rsquo; lives? Your life? What universes are being imposed? What is it to live by daily calculation? What is the bread that will feed you?</p>      
      <p>To claim our own creativity is to move to the crossroads where imagination and the word meet; it is to know that in every moment we are capable of making creative choices. Creativity is about responsibility. It&rsquo;s about owning that we are not just the heroes of our own tales, but the storyteller, too. </p>
      <p>Taking our clients from the pre-imagined life to the re-imagined life is the great journey of coaching&mdash;its gift and its challenge. To do it successfully, we need to access every bit of our own creative being. </p>
