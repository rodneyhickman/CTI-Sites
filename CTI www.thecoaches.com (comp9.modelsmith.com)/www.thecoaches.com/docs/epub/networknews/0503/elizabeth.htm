	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0502/images/3Elizabeth%20Niche%20II.jpg" width="80" height="103" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">I first heard about The Co-Creative Coaching Studio over the CTI Yahoo group when Carol Ross posted this wonderful model she was using to bring coaching to the world. I was immediately inspired and jumped at the chance to work with her. Since then, Carol, Patricia Michel and I have created The Co-Creative Coaching Studio niche community, which was unveiled November 2004 and now—less than two months later—has more 60 members in the United States and abroad. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As coaches, we know that our work can change the world, so I figured why not get some group energy going and see what kind of broader impact we can make. With this in mind, I put forth a challenge that coaches from all over the world come together and create Co-Creative Coaching Studios on January 8, 2005. Several coaches have signed up to take this challenge.  
  

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Now I want to expand the challenge: <strong>Let's all welcome Spring 2005 by holding a Co-Creative Coaching Studio on Saturday, April 2, 2005</strong>. This date gives us plenty of lead time for finding a location, pulling together three coaches, putting out events listings in local papers and chatting on the niche to get all the support you need to make the Spring International Co-Creative Coaching Studio Day a huge success. Let's intentionally coach people all over the world simultaneously and feel the ripple effect we can have when people are impacted by the power of Co-Activity. 


	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you have not joined The Co-Creative Coaching Studio niche community, please join us today. And don't forget to list your Co-Creative Coaching Studio on The Co-Creative Coaching Studio niche community calendar, where our whole community can see it!
