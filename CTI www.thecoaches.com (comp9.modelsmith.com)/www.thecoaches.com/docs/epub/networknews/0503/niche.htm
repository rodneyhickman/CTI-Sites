	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In the beginning, there floated an amorphous space. At the edges of this furry zone, individual notes of flutes, cellos and drums chimed in. The rub of pastel crayons and pen against thick artist’s paper spoke of an itch that wanted to be scratched. The cadence of voices in an improv troupe and the clicking of fingers against keyboards signaled for connection. Creativity was happening, but a greater call was being made.
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CPCCs Kathy Loh and Robin Jones heard the rhythm and noticed that the empty space between the arts and the coaching communities cried out for leadership. Colleagues in the BDP, Kathy and Robin recognized each other as fellow creative tribe members. Together, they launched the Coaching Artists niche, which after a year is going strong with 120-plus members. This dynamic niche holds a powerful stake. 
  

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“I jumped at the chance to join Robin in creating this niche,” Kathy said, from her home in the San Francisco Bay Area. “My passion for exploring the role of the arts in the evolution of consciousness prompted me to do it. Artists offer a unique contribution as leaders.”


	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Robin, who lives across the country in Kentucky, shares the vision of the artist as change agent. “We want artists to thrive because creativity is vital. Our culture isn’t our culture without art.” Together, the two created a net of coaches that spans North America and reaches across the globe to coaches in Europe, as well.     
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It didn’t take long for the niche to attract creativity coaches to the monthly calls. The community meetings revolve around conversations with guests, such as coaching luminaries Shell Tain, Laura Howard, Ken Mossman, Melanie Keveles and others. Subjects have addressed balancing coaching with art, managing money issues and newsletter creation and distribution. Robin and Kathy have been joined by CPCCs Cynthia Morris and Linda Dessau to round out a steering committee that is committed to supporting coaches who work with artists. They believe that through helping creativity coaches build thriving art and coaching practices, they can, in turn, help artists be successful and fulfill the mission of fostering a more dynamic and creative world. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	Members of the Coaching Artists niche are mostly artists themselves, practicing a range of disciplines, from music to acting to writing and fine arts. What makes an artist coach different from another type of coach is the creative approach. Often creativity coaches will use art as a way to move clients forward, and the steering committee is no exception. Kathy coaches the spiritual depth and creative spark in her clients. One unique approach she has developed is working with musicians at their instrument, even over the phone. Linda is also in the music field. Her work as a music therapist informs her coaching, and she uses songwriting as part of her coaching. Cynthia will often stop a call with a writing client and do a &quot;free-write&quot; with the client. Robin will employ his skills as a director to call the best forth from his acting clients. These methods serve to tap the source of a person’s brilliance: their creativity.     
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Community bulletin boards and polls keep conversation alive between the monthly calls. The Coaching Artists community meetings are posted on the Co-Active Network and take place on the third Thursday of each month. The symphony of creativity and synergy is inspiring and life-changing. While most members are artists, people who are curious about the role of creativity in coaching are welcome to join the calls. Come see what’s developing!	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Cynthia Morris, Original Impulse<br>Coaching writers, artists and visionaries to confidence and completion<br>303.442.0664<br>
