      <img src="http://thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0503/images/0503geolynnebrisdon.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="103" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" class="border1">      <p> The coaching community in Vancouver is celebrating the impact that our profession makes in organizations. Recognizing that promoting the benefits of organizational coaching helps raise the profile of the coaching profession, our local ICF chapter has embraced the Prism Award and is gearing up to present it later this month. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Prism Award celebrates businesses and organizations that have effectively used coaching as a leadership strategy to achieve tangible bottom-line results and other organizational impacts. Initially conceived by the ICF-Greater Toronto chapter five years ago, it&rsquo;s become an annual event there and a prestigious accolade of business and organizational excellence. It was picked up by the Calgary ICF chapter last year, and now Vancouver is the third Canadian chapter to get on board. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Businesses and organizations being considered for the award are typically nominated by ICF member coaches who have worked with them. Those who have coached the winners are also acknowledged at the awards event and both can expect media coverage of their accomplishments. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> The Prism will be presented at a business breakfast event on March 30, 2005 , at the Blue Horizon Hotel, familiar territory to anyone who&rsquo;s taken CTI courses in Vancouver. We&rsquo;ll hear from our own Steve Mitten MCC, CPCC, this year&rsquo;s ICF International President, and local business and media personality Kevin Evans will emcee. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> A significant benefit to attendees is the opportunity to learn from a senior member of the Prism Award winner&rsquo;s leadership team, about how coaching has helped him or her achieve excellence. Coaches are encouraged to invite prospective clients to get first-hand information on how coaching is used to achieve business and organizational goals. There&rsquo;s sure to be valuable learning for coaches who are considering offering their services in the corporate arena. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> We&rsquo;ve received nominations from coaches working with high-profile clients in the Greater Vancouver business community, and we&rsquo;re expecting an exciting line-up of competitors. Nominations will be reviewed by our judging committee, led by Ray Williams and accompanied by Suzanne Beatty and Katherine Hind. They will interview a senior representative of each selected nominee to establish three finalists. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> At the event, the winner will be announced and presented with an elegant pyramid shaped quartz crystal mounted on a rosewood base, and finalists will be presented with recognition plaques. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Former winners in Greater Toronto and Calgary include: Scotia Bank Commercial Banking, Ontario Ministry of Training Colleges and Universities (MTCU), Aventis Pasteur Canada , Pearson Education Canada, and Hallmark Tubulars. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Linda Forest , ICF Vancouver&rsquo;s Vice President, provides inspired leadership for the Prism 2005 committee, joined by Ray Williams, Wanda Wilson and Lynne Brisdon, all CTI trained coaches. They have been enthusiastically organizing the event with help from Dream Team Communications, a local company that specializes in event planning for non-profit organizations. We&rsquo;d also like to acknowledge Vancouver-based CTI leader Juhree Zimmerman and CTI for their encouragement and support in launching and promoting this event. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Sponsorship opportunities are available for businesses seeking recognition from the coaching profession and from the organizations that strive for excellence. For more information, contact Charlene Brisson at 604 688-8108 or email <a class=orange href="mailto:Charlene@dream-team.ca. ">Charlene@dream-team.ca. </a></p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Coaches located in or near Vancouver can join our celebration at the breakfast event on March 30. Early registration by March 11 is $49, and then $59 Cdn until March 25. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> For more information about the business breakfast event, the nomination process and registration, please visit us at <a class=orange href="http://www.vancouvericf.org" target="_blank">www.vancouvericf.org</a>. </p>
