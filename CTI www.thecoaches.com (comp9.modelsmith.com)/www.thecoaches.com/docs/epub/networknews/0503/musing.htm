	  <em> The Evolution of the Coach </em></p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">I offer this to you as an invitation to expand your life, your perceptions of the world and your awareness of the teacher within. This is an invitation to engage in an elevated form of relating or coaching that supports a higher calling, the embracing of <em>joy</em> or <em>being</em> and the surrender into the flow of life and the fullness of who you are. This is an invitation to create your life in a whole new way and awaken the teacher within! </p>
	   <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">There is an evolution from coach to teacher you may be ready for which is nothing more than an evolution of consciousness, a leap into the unknown. What does it mean to be a spiritual teacher? It simply means to awaken to the light of truth. To embody higher consciousness. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"> Tired of endless striving, clinging and searching, awakening the teacher within is a calling to surrender, let go and fall into the mystery of life. </p>
	  <p align="center" style="margin: 10 0 10 0"><em> Know, my friend, that I have searched<br>
  And found this world a desert of mirage<br>
  Yet the music of some veiled oasis<br>
  Is pulling tender sadness from my heart </em></p>

	 <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"> As a coach, trying to get somewhere became tiring and endless. As much as I enjoyed and found success in coaching, I still felt like a monkey swinging on one branch and looking for how I could get to the next one. I was afraid to let go. I was also tired of coaching others to live a similar life&mdash;coaching people to build their business, achieve that next goal, accomplish that next task, reach that next level and to in general &ldquo;make it.&rdquo; Make it where? It was no longer fulfilling to coach people to build an illusion of &ldquo;success,&rdquo; to master swinging from one vine to the next. I was tired of coaching people on how best to live within the dream versus coaching them to leave the dream altogether. Success for me had changed. It was no longer enough to have a full practice, a woman I loved and a nice family. Success now meant something more. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">What used to be important no longer mattered. Old interests and ambitions soon fell away. And what was born was a new kind of &ldquo;success&rdquo;&mdash;a fulfillment that was determined not by anything more than the awakening of my soul, the embodiment of <em>being</em> and the simple yet blissful joy that comes in this awakened state. The irony is, when you awaken the teacher within, sustenance and abundance become a natural consequence. </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">The evolution of coach to teacher is a shift in awareness and perception. It is an awakening to joy and infinite possibilities. It is a realization that above all, you are neither coach nor teacher but rather something larger than you could ever have imagined. And your function here on earth is simply to be a mirror reflecting this knowing, this consciousness, allowing the student to greet himself or herself through your presence, awakening the teacher within. </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">This is the evolution of coach to teacher. It is your calling. It is your &ldquo;purpose.&rdquo; The teacher within patiently awaits your answer and continues to be the voice that whispers in your ear to let go, come home and fall once again back into the Love you truly are. </p>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">I am not interested in coaching the caterpillar to be a happy, successful caterpillar. I am not interested in coaching people to more effectively paddle upstream. I want to coach individuals to courageously embrace their metamorphosis, to spread their wings and fly. I want to coach people to release their paddles and float gracefully to where the river meets the ocean! This is my intention and this is my invitation to you! </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 10 0"> If you wish to know, I am certified through CTI, have completed Leadership and in a previous life, obtained a Bachelors of Business Administration. I coach on the phone and provide no intake session. My coaching is simply moment-to-moment, offering you a detached, loving and spacious energy to awaken the teacher within! </p>
