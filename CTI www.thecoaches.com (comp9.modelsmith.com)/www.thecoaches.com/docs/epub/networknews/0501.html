	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As I reflect on the year that has passed, I wonder how I could ever have imagined what was in store for me, for CTI and for the world way back in January 2004. I am continually in awe of what has happened. We celebrated, we mourned, we accomplished, we failed, we got grounded, and we were given the opportunity to create something next, something new. The piece here, for me, is do I REALLY know all that is coming? It's quite exciting, and I'm in the best company to experience it. Let's lock our virtual arms together and embrace our future(s) together! Welcome to 2005!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'm excited about this month's news. It's our inaugural issue featuring the new section,  "Ask Judith." Anyone provided an answer by Judith Cohen will surely be served in a huge way. We ALL will be. Thanks, Judith!</td>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have a thriving new niche as you can see by all of the events it has posted for January: The Coaching Salon niche is becoming one success story after another. Also, I invited Akasha Halsey, President of the Marin Coaches Alliance ICF Chapter, to submit an article for our Geographic section. Akasha has once again rallied her neighboring ICF chapters here in the San Francisco Bay Area to create a tantalizing event with the acclaimed poet, David Whyte, which brings me to this month's Musing. I wanted David to write us a special piece for the Musing section, and I ended up with a wonderful article that I was able to get permission to print for you. It resonates for me. I know you'll enjoy it. Dive in.

Turns out it's not a new name. Someone under the auspices of Coachville has been using that name for several years, with a similar bent on helping others learn about coaching through a shared experience of observing live coaching. Even the act of watching someone else demonstrate a discipline is not new. Think cooking shows, home remodeling shows and black belt demonstrations at the local karate studio. What is new is the way in which The Coaching Salon transforms the participants as well as the observers. Here's how it works:

Sun, fog, hot, cool and downright nippy all in one region. There are a few oddities here, as well. One of our bridges is "golden." We can claim not one, but FOUR, chapters of the International Coach Federation. And those chapters are in an area within one hour of each other (if there's no traffic and you catch the lights right). So many coaches, so many chapters, so little time to take it all in.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That's one reason I thought it would be a good idea for the Marin Coaches Alliance to collaborate with all the other chapters in the Bay Area and do an event that was mutually beneficial to all of us. We'd get a chance to "meet" on the phone during the planning process, get to know each other from the standpoint of what we each brought to share and then have the pleasure of meeting in person at the event.

Leadership dominates our conversations in organizations&mdash;large, small, entrepreneurial, or academic. I am often asked: "What is the secret of leadership?" as if it were a static piece of information rather than a dynamic relationship between an individual and the world. Some believe that if you simply adopt certain traits&mdash;being decisive, taking bold risks, or articulating a clear and compelling vision of the future&mdash;you will have the very stuff of leadership. But do any of these commonly observed traits make up that magic ingredient that invites others to join or follow an individual? It is my opinion that they are not enough by themselves. They are isolated diagnostic characteristics that a given leader may have, but to my mind they are not the heart of the matter.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'd like to start off by saying, Thank You! to all of you who have been vigilant in <b>managing your email</b> accounts on the Network. Seems we're getting better and yet you can count on me to hold the bar high on this one. The trick, I assert, is in remembering all the places your email is connected to on any given day, especially when you're trying to tie down all those loose ends before you go away from your computer for a weekend getaway, business trip or extended vacation. Well, the Co-Active Network is one of those loose ends to tighten up before you leave. This seems to show up across the board and mostly with our corporate friends who enable "auto reply" on their email accounts. Please remember to go to "Manage Account" and select "no mail" or simply un-check all the boxes to the right of your communities in which you belong. <i>Helpful Hint: Put a sticky note on your computer screen as a structure to remember that the Co-Active Network is impacted by your auto replies.</i>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You may have noticed that some of your discussions that promote services and opportunities have disappeared on the Main Community discussions list. Don't panic, I've moved them to the <b>Promos</b> thread. This is now the place to post all of your fantastic opportunities. If you're selling, you're promoting. Simple eh? This allows the receiver to choose. A much better impact indeed!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ever been one to look for a <b>bridgeline</b> for a specific event on the Network? Here's a couple of tips for you. First, go to the event description posted on the calendar. It may have been added to the description closer to the date of the event. In some cases, it's posted there at the time the event was created. Second, if it's quite a bit of time before the event, say five days or more, you may need to simply wait and see if you receive an email from the organizer closer to the date of the event. And third, this is usually saved for those desperate, last-minute, "Oh my gosh, what's the number?" times: send an urgent email to the organizer of the community or post a discussion in the community of origin. Let me explain this last piece. Most all events except "Main Events" are generated in a particular Niche or Geographic community. Post your urgent plea to the community of origin. There is a link at the bottom of the event description to take you there. It looks like this: "This page is a pointer to this original event."
