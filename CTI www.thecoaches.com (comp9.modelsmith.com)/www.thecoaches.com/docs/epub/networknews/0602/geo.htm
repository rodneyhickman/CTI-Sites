   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Now, I&rsquo;m  not going to spend a lot of time digging into the historical facts of how this  tradition began, nor focus on the theories of how it&rsquo;s really a marketing scam  perpetuated by greeting card, chocolate and flower companies (the deadly  romantic three).</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">No, it  seems quite uncoach-like to bring up all that when there&rsquo;s a bountiful topic  that really needs some examination and attention. Relationships. </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It does  seem quite coach-like to explore how to further enrich and embrace the  relationships that we do have.</p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Obviously,  Valentine&rsquo;s Day is that yearly reminder for many of us to celebrate that big  intimate relationship of ours in the form of presents and special dinners out  to exquisite French restaurants. For those who don&rsquo;t have one to celebrate,  there seems to be this &ldquo;less than&rdquo; attribute, as though something is wrong if  you don&rsquo;t have someone to spend hundreds of dollars on this high holy day of  love. How ridiculous. Valentines Day is kind of like the &ldquo;Sneeches&rdquo;&mdash;a constant  comparison between those who have and have not.&nbsp;  And who is better? </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Really,  Valentines Day is not about all the jewelry and vacations and sweets, like we  see on TV. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is about taking time out to appreciate that intimate  relationship, any and all of them, that is so important to us. Take away the  cards, the candy, the dinners out, the lingerie, the diamonds and all those  tokens of expression, and what is left? The relationship.</p>
   <p>So I  propose that we change February to National Relationship Month. Heck, we&rsquo;re  already devoting one entire day to an intimate relationship, why not take  advantage and celebrate all the many other wonderful and valued relationships  that ebb and flow in our lives with the other 27 days?</p>
   <p>So I&rsquo;ve  come up with a couple of challenges for you all to take on this month.</p>
   <p>Challenge  #1 is about acknowledging and valuing your current relationships.</p>
   <p>Take out a  sheet of paper and write down all the relationships you can think of: intimate,  family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, community, all the people that you  interact and connect with. Now take out your calendar/datebook/Blackberry and  put a different relationship in each day of February. (The 14th has  already been done for most of you.)&nbsp; Now,  when that day comes around, you get to focus your attention on that  relationship. What works about it? What doesn&rsquo;t work? What can you count on  them for? What can they count on you for? Pick three words that describe the  essence of your relationship with that person. And perhaps take some time that  day to make contact with him or her. You don&rsquo;t have to buy them all a card or  gift or even do anything except give yourself a little time to appreciate and  love that relationship. </p>
   <p>Think about  it. At then end of the month, you will have given yourself the gift of  connecting with 28 important people in your life.</p>
   <p>Challenge  #2 comes as an opportunity to make a difference in one of or all of your  relationships.</p>
   <p>This  spring, CTI will be bringing the Relationship and Organizational Systems  Coaching course to Chicago with three opportunities to attend  the Fundamentals weekend&mdash;Feb 11, April 8 and June 3&mdash;before committing to the  entire curriculum. As an additional incentive, leaders Grace Flannery and David  Darst will be leading a special lecture/presentation/demonstration for the ICF  Chicago Chapter, Monday, February 13, from 5-7 pm. Even if you attend the prior  Fundamentals weekend, you will experience new areas of relationship coaching  uniquely designed for this workshop. You don&rsquo;t have to be a member to attend,  you just have to want to attend. </p>
   <p>The super  extra bonus is that this evening is open to everyone, coaches and non-coaches  alike. In fact, this time around, all participants are invited to bring a  spouse or friend&mdash;any type of relationship you may have&mdash;that you&rsquo;d like to make  a difference in.</p>
