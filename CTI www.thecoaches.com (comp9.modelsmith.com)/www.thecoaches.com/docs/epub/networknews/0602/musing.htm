&mdash;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe </p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>I have a confession.</b><br>
        I was a geek in grade school. I was that nerdy girl wearing the polyester  &quot;floods&quot; from Pic&rsquo;n Save. I kept my nose in books like <i>Jane Eyre</i> or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Small talk baffled me. Then in the sixth grade,  two popular girls adopted me. They took me to the mall and taught me how to  dress, became my friends and included me in their activities. Soon I was  learning how to make friends and flirt and hold my own with the  &quot;cool&quot; kids (politically active, articulate, popular, musically hip)  I admired. What happened? These two girls pulled me up to their level of social  finesse by association. And these girls were great people&mdash;smart, socially  aware, responsible and compassionate human beings. People I admire to this day.  Our values meshed. And they knew something I needed to learn about social  rapport.         
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>And this brings us to this tip:</b><br>
         <i>Success by Association</i>. One of the easiest, quickest and most effective  ways to ensure change is to surround yourself with people who will pull you  into your future. Look for people who reflect who you want to become. They have  accomplished your goal or are well on their way.         
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Here are some ideas:</b>
	     <ul>
	       <li> Want to lose weight and get healthy? Make  friends with people who eat healthily and work out.              </li>
	       <li> Want to increase your sales? Hang out with  people who are great at sales. </li>
	       <li> Want more inner peace? Spend time with  peaceful friends. </li>
	       <li> Want to be a millionaire? Get yourself into a  group of millionaires. </li>
           <li> Want to be a kinder, happier person? Find  yourself some kind, happy people. Consider joining a charity.<br>
   </li>
      </ul>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  And this is key: <b>Celebrate the successes of your friends!</b> Their success  shows you that you are getting closer. The more successful your friends are,  the more successful you will be too!</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Why this works:</b><br>
           What is around you becomes more real, more normal. You start to think like your  comrades. You don't have to fight the pull of a negative environment. A  community of people who are what you want to become creates an energetic  momentum that carries you forward. This new reality becomes imprinted in your  unconscious. You are moving forward even when you are not consciously  &quot;working&quot; at it.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>My invitation: </b><br>
           Notice where you spend your time. How can you surround yourself with people who  will help you move forward?<br>
           Strengthening your  boundaries is one of the most powerful ways to transform your relationships and  improve your life personally and professionally. This month, we look at  boundaries.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">           Boundaries let us know the difference between our authentic selves and our  social self that is based on pleasing others. People with strong boundaries  lead happier, more fulfilling lives. They feel confident to speak their truth.  They accept what they want and they reject what they don't want in their lives.  Having strong boundaries is very attractive.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">           Weak boundaries disempower us and disrespect those around us.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">           Weak boundaries show up in a number of ways:</p>
	     <blockquote>
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&bull;&nbsp; The inability to say no.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; The fear of displeasing someone.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; The tendency to rescue others.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; The expectation of being rescued.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Not expressing our true feelings.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Attracting people who take advantage  of us.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Allowing outside opinions to determine  our self-worth.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Feeling like a victim.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Feeling obligated, indebted.<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Trying to change someone else.	       </blockquote>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <b>So where do weak boundaries come from?</b> &nbsp;<br>
           When we were children, pleasing parents and teachers and friends was necessary  to our survival. We needed to learn how to bond, how to read reactions, how to  compromise. These are not skills to give up. This is where we learn the empathy  and compassion that makes relationship possible.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">           Problems arise when, as adults, we are unconsciously ruled by these needs to  please, bond or compromise. We are operating out of fear more than love. When  we are acting from unconscious impulses, we give up our ability to choose  responsibly, and we become victims and victimizers.</p>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> We all have areas in our lives where our boundaries are nice and strong, and  other areas where our boundaries get weaker. (The higher the stakes, the  stronger the likelihood is that fear will come in and weaken our boundaries.)  The easiest way to check the strength of your boundaries is to ask yourself:  &quot;How free do I feel here to say what I feel and to ask for what I  want?&quot;<br>
           <br>
           <b>The invitation:</b><br>
           Take a look at your own life. </p>
	     <blockquote>
	       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&bull;&nbsp; Where are your boundaries strongest?<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; Where are they weakest? Why?<br>
	         &bull;&nbsp; What small step can you take to be  more honest and authentic in that area of your life?	       </p>
         </blockquote>
	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As you strengthen your boundaries in any area of your life, you will increase  your self-confidence. You will attract better relationships. You will enjoy  more respect and success.</p>
