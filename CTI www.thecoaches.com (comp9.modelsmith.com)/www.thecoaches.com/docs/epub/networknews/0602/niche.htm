      <p><b>The Retirement Lifestyle Coaching Community</b></p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0602/images/niche0602.jpg" width="82" height="125" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The members  of the Retirement Lifestyle Coaching community would like to welcome you to our  monthly telecalls. Our next call will be on Wednesday, February 15, at noon (Pacific), and our guests will be  Dr. William Sadler and Jim Krefft, from the Third Age Centre. They will be  introducing their new book <i>Changing  Course: A Cure for the Common Retirement</i>, which looks at useful and novel  approaches to third-age careers.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our March  15 call, also at noon (Pacific), will feature Larry Hurst from Transition  Life-Coaching, who will talk about his work with the &ldquo;super elderly&rdquo; and their  special needs.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You can see  that our Retirement Lifestyle Coaching community is exploring the new  phenomenon of how retirement is changing&mdash;and changing fast, with more than  10,000 Baby Boomers turning 60 every day! Our community members are finding  ways to partner with other professionals, such as financial planners,  accountants, estate lawyers and health care professionals to provide the  lifestyle component for these many retirees as they plan for active and  successful retirement years.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Because the  needs of the Baby Boomer generation are as diverse and elusive as they are  enormous, our members are constantly searching for effective ways to market to  this group. To assist in our learning and planning process, we recently  conducted an online survey on what constitutes quality of life in retirement.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Respondents  represented those 50 to 70 years old, mostly U.S. residents (80%, as compared to 20%  Canadian residents). Only 12% are fully retired with 25% in semi-retirement and  22% planning to retire. Others are actively planning career changes, starting a  new business or working full-time.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When asked  to respond to the question, &ldquo;For you, what constitutes quality of life in  retirement?&rdquo; they replied as follows: </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Good  health&mdash;90%</li>
        <li>Financial  well being&mdash;85%</li>
        <li>Living  your dreams&mdash;83%</li>
        <li>Travel&mdash;76% </li>
        <li>The  opportunity to work&mdash;61%.</li>
      </ul>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This list  of priorities provides our retirement lifestyle coaches with insight into  potential niche markets. Health concerns alone offer opportunity for practices  focusing on nutrition, exercise and personal training, as well as support for  health care in the many existing specific health conditions. Health concerns  can be expanded into family health issues and relationship coaching, as people  deal with their changing health issues&mdash;both their own and those of their family  members.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course,  these niches can be further segmented into women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s issues, or addressing  the needs of the many in the &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; position of dealing with aging parents  and boomerang children.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The high  importance placed on the opportunity to work, 61% in the survey responses,  reflects a newly defining aspect of retirement life. This is driven by the fact  that many retirees expect to have 30+ years of healthy life ahead of them. Not  only do they want to supplement their financial resources to be sure they have  adequate means to meet these long-term needs, but they also want to be busy,  feel useful and be engaged in something they love to do.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Many  retirees are returning to work in part-time positions especially created for  them to capitalize on the expertise that companies cannot replace but also to  permit the retiree the flexibility to engage in other activities. Others are  setting themselves up as independent consultants, maximizing their skills  advising the industry at large that they know from years of experience. Still  others are turning hobbies into businesses or creating a business in an area in  which they have always wanted to work.</p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What is  evident from the responses to the Retirement Lifestyle Coaching survey on what  constitutes quality of life in retirement is that the respondents place a high  priority on issues such as personal growth and freedom, having a life purpose  and making a contribution to the community and world in which they live. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Seminars  that help these people prepare to retire are important to having a successful  retirement experience. People who have a carefully thought out retirement  lifestyle plan to complement their financial plan have a much higher chance of  enjoying a fulfilling and meaningful life in their retirement years.</p>
