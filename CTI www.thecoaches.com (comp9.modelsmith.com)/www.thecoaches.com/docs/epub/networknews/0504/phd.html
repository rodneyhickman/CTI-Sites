	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0504/niche.jpg" width="127" height="127" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="" vspace="10">How would you like to be part of a pioneering research project? There are many great coaching books out there, but they have to be taken on trust. Not being validated, they lack credibility in some quarters. That's why I'm tremendously excited about the PhD in coaching I'm doing with Oxford-Brookes University. We all know the power of coaching, and one way of promoting its worth is through providing compelling evidence. This PhD is only one little step but it honours my values of life-long learning and getting coaching out there in the world with enhanced legitimacy.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The aim of my research is to investigate the processes in coaching that lead to change and in particular the "aha" moment of insight that shifts perception, called variously a paradigm shift, a "light-bulb" moment, an expansion of mental models, an epiphany, satori, etc.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The research seeks to "unpack" such moments by addressing these issues: under what conditions do "aha" moments occur; what happens immediately beforehand; crucially, how is the phenomenon experienced by the client; and what attitudinal and behavioural changes ensue as a result?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What we do know is that "ahas" happen in consciousness. For his detailed and ingenious "spectrum of consciousness" model, I am indebted to Ken Wilber. An "aha" moment can occur anywhere along the spectrum from a simple new insight to a life-changing event. This spectrum embraces levels of matter, body, mind, soul and spirit. As a practising Buddhist (the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin), I am keen to work with an integrative coaching model that addresses contemplative, as well as mental and physical, activities. My own interests have resulted in my pursuing qualifications in meridian therapies, NLP and Qi Gong.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have been collecting data from three sources:
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 27"><b>Diaries:</b> Where coach and client journal their experience at the end of the coaching session. This captures the lived experience of the "aha" moment.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 27"><b>Questionnaires:</b> Completed by past, as well as present, clients so that they can describe in detail their experiences and any lasting changes in attitudes, beliefs and behaviours as a result of their insights. Done by telephone, the process usually takes 20-30 minutes.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 27"><b>Interviews:</b> Conducted by telephone with clients so they can describe in their own words their "aha" moments.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For those of you who share my value of learning, I invite you to join me in gathering data from your clients. It will be fun and add to the learning for all of us. Added benefits include receiving a copy of the finished thesis and the kudos of mentioning this involvement in your promotional literature.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So please get co-active with me. E-mail <a class="orange" href="mailto:leighlonghurst@hotmail.com">leighlonghurst@hotmail.com</a>.
