	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Choosing Love Over Litigation</b>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0504/ross.jpg" width="88" height="123" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">When Shirley Anderson and I met, we found our best selves in each other.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I'm the creator of The Co-Creative Coaching Studio and one of the organizers of the niche community of the same name. The Studio was formerly known as The Coaching Salon, the same name that has been used by Shirley for a virtual learning community for the last four years. I wrote an article for the Co-Active newsletter in January about my "Coaching Salon" and within 30 minutes of the email hitting inboxes, I heard from one of Shirley's supporters. The sender asked, "How willing are you to change the name of your venue, as it could easily be a source of confusion?" and then went on to suggest possible alternative names.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I pondered the question and wondered about the sender of such a polite request. The sender was not Shirley's attorney. She was simply someone who admired Shirley and her work. I went to <a href="http://www.coachingsalon.com" target="blank">www.coachingsalon.com</a>, Shirley's website, to refresh my memory. I had been alerted to the website last fall but didn't know what to do. Lacking a clear solution, I did what a lot of people end up doing with messy stuff. I did nothing and hoped it would go away. It would be great if denial were the magic pixie dust to turn wishes into reality. Instead, denial is like manure&mdash;we instinctively turn away but the smell lingers on. Now I could see that I might be headed for trouble. When I looked at Shirley's website this time, I noticed something new. Shirley now had "TM" next to the name, The Coaching Salon, to indicate a trademark.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The next morning, I got an email from someone curious about "the original Coaching Salon," asking for contact information. The sender also wondered why I had chosen a business name that was already in use by someone else. Did I have an agreement with that person to use the name? Gulp. The Universe was calling my bluff.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I decided to send an email to my attorney to discuss the issue. Fear had taken hold of me for one slight moment. Thankfully, my attorney did not respond immediately.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In the meantime, I wondered why I had made a point of mentioning that I knew about the original Coaching Salon in the newsletter article. I wondered why I had not edited it out when I had several months to do so before submitting the article. I wondered how a savvy businesswoman could be in such an awkward situation. I could see that something was up, but I wasn't sure what, so I started to write.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Journaling helps me get to the bottom of things quickly, to draw the picture that is not yet visible to the conscious mind. Once I began writing, I could see that letting myself get caught had been the easiest way to create a resolution. Sometimes, the soul knows what the mind cannot accept. I also realized that I had been evading direct communication&mdash;something that I had faulted my family for just the day before. It was clear to me now that I was equally guilty of avoiding and skirting difficult issues&mdash;in this case, the problem with the Salon name. No attorney could help me with this one. I needed to walk my talk. I went to Shirley's website, got her number, and gave her picture one last look.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After procrastinating by reading email and having a large breakfast, I started to dial Shirley's number. I wondered, "What will I say? Will I need to explain who I am?"  The answers came to me without hesitation. "Be authentic and tell the truth. No need to explain who you are. She'll know who you are."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When Shirley answered the phone, I said, "Hi Shirley, this is Carol Ross." Shirley immediately burst out laughing. I could tell from her warm and inviting laugh that everything would be fine. The words that poured out of her mouth stunned me. "I've just spent the last 90 minutes on your website and I love who you are." She went on to say that someone had forwarded her my article. She had gone to my website, read several of my articles, and seen that I was coming from the same "heart place." She had intended to send me an email but wasn't sure what to say. Shirley told me she tried to put herself in my shoes and realized that maybe I hadn't thought to do a Google search before naming the Salon (I had not). I was struck by Shirley's generosity&mdash;her ability to set aside our reason for running into each other, to give me the benefit of the doubt, to see me for who I am, and then to fully embrace me. Who was this woman?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Shirley told me in that first conversation that she was going to recommend to her Salon audience (which numbers about 1,000) that they check out my website. True to her word, an email to her Salon mailing list the next week had Shirley's endorsement of my website. I came clean in that first conversation about knowing of her Salon last fall and not knowing what to do. I told Shirley that I wanted to honor her use of The Coaching Salon name for the last four years and find another name. Shirley started to suggest ways of finding a new name. And so it went, back and forth. We've talked once a week since that first call, about our common passion around coaching, dissecting how our respective forums are alike and different, and figuring out just why we were meant to come together. We came together because of The Coaching Salon name, and yet, this is also about something much bigger than a name.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The story is still unfolding. Shirley and I are collaborating on a number of fronts. I am still taking in the full impact of that first call. I suspect I will continue to do so for a long time.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">There are many gifts that Shirley has given me. The greatest gift is that she has shown me what is possible when one works from love and truth. I finally came clean and Shirley loved me all the more for it. Thanks, Shirley.
