	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0504/jernstedt.jpg" width="99" height="118" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">The Portland Co-Active Community is now starting to come into bloom. With an increased dedication to tending to our Co-Active garden and more gardeners to now help facilitate, Stacey Lane, Nancy Warnock and I are excited about what this garden will bring to fellow coaches in the area and to the world.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The three of us met to discuss what was needed to strengthen our community here and find ways that we could all connect, learn and have fun with each other. We wanted to better serve the Co-Active community here and create a more active group to increase our learning and sharing. We brainstormed some options and have put in place two on-going events to achieve this.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We first wanted to create an event in which we could all come together and build a greater sense of community with each other in a social environment. As we all know, coaching can be a fairly isolating profession.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have organized First Fridays for all Co-Active coaches to come together for Happy Hour and connect over a glass of wine and great conversation. OK, maybe it is over a couple of glasses of wine and gin and tonics. It seems the learning goes much deeper after your first glass!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We had our first event on March 4 and had a great turnout. It must have been due to our great door prizes we received from Andrew Gabel in the CTI office! We each went around sharing our journey that led us to coaching and what kind of work we are currently doing. We also shared issues and insights with each other, which was an amazing learning opportunity for us all. It was great to be able to come together and build new friendships and relationships.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a relative newbie to coaching and the Co-Active community, it was fun to hear all the great types of coaching that is being done here and all the possible niches one could have. After hearing everyone's stories, I realized what an amazing impact we are having in the Rose City, neighboring communities and around the world.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Because our garden is geographically spread out across the state of Oregon and Southwest Washington, we felt we needed to do something else for those people who can't make it to Portland easily. We are hosting a monthly telecall for our community members as another opportunity for all of us to get together and deepen our learning.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We will be having a different speaker each call for members to ask any burning questions they may have about their coaching, clients or running their practice.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our first call was on March 25. Judith Cohen was gracious enough to be our first guest. She was masterful at answering our questions and sharing her insights. We appreciate the time she gave us. We look forward to having future guests dance in our garden in the months to come.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Through our First Friday events and our monthly telecalls, we are hoping to build momentum and bring even more local Co-Active coaches out of the woodwork. We are all doing great work individually, but can you imagine the impact we could have as a stronger, connected group? Look out world!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are looking forward to having more local people get involved and invite others outside of the Pacific Northwest to take a stroll through our garden. We would love to hear how other communities are staying connected. We'll be toasting you all at our next First Friday on the 1st.
