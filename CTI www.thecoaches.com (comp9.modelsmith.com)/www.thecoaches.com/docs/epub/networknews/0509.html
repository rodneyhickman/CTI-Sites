<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0509/images/Niche%20CAN%20Sep05.jpg" width="85" height="124" align="right">When we think of heroes that we have known throughout time, we reflect on people who have left an enormous impact on the world through some kind of personal sacrifice. Often, what comes to mind are men and women who gave their time and energy to make a difference that has been recorded in time. Presidents, saints, visionaries are all part of the history and mythology that surrounds heroes. And maybe, just maybe, there are people right here in our own lives that need to be recognized as our personal heroes.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>What is a hero?</b><br>
	  <i>The
	  American Heritage Dictionary</i> defines a hero as: “Any man noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially one who has risked or sacrificed his life.” Today, the word hero no longer has this exact dictionary definition. I believe we have a new perception of the word “hero,” redefining our image of who actually qualifies. The word “new” intimates that something is different. Somehow, the old way of thinking about what a hero is no longer exists. The new heroes may be humanitarians, serving others, inspiring people in different ways by how they live their lives. It may be a person who is committed to changing something in his or her community by personal example. Passion is there, as well and a willingness to be selfless in the desire to bring about change.

	   coaching group in the Seattle

	   area?” a

	    colleague in another field
	   recently asked me. “Why

	    do you need another group?” She

	     was confused. She was not
	    a coach. She had never attended
	    a CTI course. But I know that’s

	     a question on several other
	    coach’s

	     minds in the Greater Seattle

	     area. There is already a strong

	     ICF chapter called the Puget

	     Sound Coaches Association
	    (PSCA), which does a wonderful
	    job of bringing all the local
	    coaches together and offers
	    excellent networking opportunities,
	    guest speakers and panel discussions.

	     The Seattle area is also home

	     to the Academy for Coach Training

	     in Bellevue, WA, which is
	    owned and operated by a CTI
	    graduate and Master Certified
	    Coach, Fran Fisher. So, why
	    a CTI geographic community
	    in the Seattle area?
    <p>To
      answer such a simple question,
      think back to your experiences
      at CTI. What were some of
      your favorite courses? The
      Co-Active Coaching Course
      (Fundamentals)? Fulfillment?
      Balance? Process? Synergy?
      Relationship Coaching? Certification?
      Leadership? What connections
      did you make in those classes
      with other students and the
      leaders? Do you still live
      from the place of your Future
      Self? How BIG is your coaching
      or how BIG are you showing
      up in your life?</p>

        This feedback strikes at
        a gut level. It may be surprising
        that what you consider normal
        is perceived by others as
        extreme. This disconnect
        occurs when your unique
        qualities manifest with
        more intensity than that
        of the average person. The
        irony is that you feel criticized
        for something fundamental
        to your success! People
        with this “too” intensity
      hear things like:       
      <ul>
        <li>You’re too much of a perfectionist; you can’t expect us to keep up.	</li>
        <li>You’re too goal-oriented; you only care about results, not people. </li>
        <li>You’re too busy; you never have time for friends or family.      </li>
      </ul>      
      <p align="left" style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Ignoring these perceptions can restrict your career options, as well as personal relationships. The challenge is pausing long enough to recognize your current impact and identify your desired one. 


	  
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Take Chris* for example, who earned a critical role based on superb attention to detail, great intelligence and unparalleled dedication. This intensity, however, yielded an unanticipated result. Chris’ “efficient” directness was perceived as condescending, and colleagues worried about getting on Chris’ “bad side.” People said Chris was too task-oriented and too fast-paced. There was also significant personal impact. As the workday grew longer and longer, there was less attention to family, individual rejuvenation and personal health, which was suffering.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">How are those profiles coming? Are you taking the opportunity to design your impact with your personal and business information on the Co-Active Network? If you’ve taken a CTI course, you have the opportunity to sell yourself with a complete profile, and we get to know who you are and who to refer people to as well. It works both ways. If you’re a CPCC, when folks come to our main website <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com" target="_blank" class="orange">www.thecoaches.com</a> and click on Find-A-Coach, it now pulls from the Co-Active Network profile system of our certified coaches. So get those profiles completed and don’t forget to add your photos.

    <p>A big THANK YOU to all you travelers and extended meeting-goers and holiday celebrationists for remembering to set your email accounts to “no mail” in the Manage Account area. I believe we’re creating better habits around our email delivery options and decreasing the negative impact on the membership of the Co-Active Network at large.  Keep up the good work.

	     Z.N.:
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I believe that most of us would like to shift perceived blame from ourselves to other people. After all, who wants to feel bad about the actions that we may or may not have taken? However, blame is not particularly useful when creating learning, especially in painful situations. The most important thing that you can do in working with a client around this issue is to establish that there is more than one point of view about the situation in which he finds himself. Interestingly, there are clients who have the same problem in reverse. They take the blame for everything rather than realistically assessing a situation to determine what is going on.

	  <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Greetings Greater Seattle Co-Active Coaches! Welcome to the first monthly meeting for the greater Seattle Co-Active community! We have scheduled the first monthly meeting at the Ballard Library, 5614 22nd Ave. NW, Seattle,  WA 98107 (206-684-4089). The Ballard Library is newly constructed, has a huge meeting room, has underground parking and is conveniently one block north of Tully's and Verite Coffee (drinks and food are allowed in the room) off of Market Street and 22nd. We plan to use the two-hour time for: 1. General hellos and networking 2. Getting to know you—who you are, what you're doing with coaching and what you're looking for as a coach in the way of support, resources, etc. 3. Talk about future meetings: what do you want to see, experience and play with? 4. Reconnect with CTI moments. Since this will be our first meeting, let's give each other permission to “dance in the moment” and create what we desire. Here we go, Greater Seattle! Questions? Please contact Scott: <a href="mailto:scott@openheartcoaching.com" class="orange">scott@openheartcoaching.com</a> or Halimah: <a href="mailto:bellroche@earthlink.net" class="orange">bellroche@earthlink.net</a>.
