	  <p>Spring cleaning continues. This editorial is an important  read this month. Please take the time. It will serve the almost 9,500 members  of this community.

      <p><b>Reflections on Authenticity<br>
      </b>by Nick Fowler<br>
Co-leader, Coaching in  Organizations</p>

      
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0705/niche07-c.jpg" width="124" height="84" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">It seems that everywhere I  turn, I am hearing about the importance of &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo;&mdash;especially at work,  where many of us &ldquo;know&rdquo; we can&rsquo;t really be authentic. It wouldn&rsquo;t be  &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; It would be too risky. It could be career-limiting. So what is  going on? This month&rsquo;s Fast Company  cover even cites the &ldquo;Selling of Authenticity&rdquo; by Nike, BMW and Starbucks. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What are we talking about here  anyway? Webster defines authenticity as &ldquo;true to one&rsquo;s own personality, spirit  or character,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not false or imitation.&rdquo; On a recent niche call with about  50 people, we began by talking about authenticity, playing with different  definitions and hearing different perspectives. Later on that same call, we  heard a story about a challenge, a choice and the differences it had made for  the teller. We shifted to a different level of listening and hearing. We felt  and understood in a different way what authenticity really was. </p>

Now  imagine the Middle East, where people who speak Hebrew and people who speak  Arabic have learned a common language called Co-Activity. I have good news for  you: people in Israel are making this dream a reality, one small step at a  time. Co-Activity is growing very rapidly in Israel, and as the song goes, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  only just begun!&rdquo;
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It seems like only yesterday that I attended an information  evening promoting the first CTI course in Israel. I clearly remember CTI leader  Juhree Zimmerman giving a 15-minute demo coaching session via telephone from  her office in Vancouver to someone sitting next to me in Tel Aviv and thinking  how easy and magical it seemed. I was immediately turned on to Co-Active  coaching, and the flame has been growing ever since. I was in that first course  in January 2003, along with Abi Shilon, my friend and founder/co-director of  CTI-Israel.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">When the first course in Israel was almost the last one, Abi  approached me and said in his quiet, modest and understated manner, &ldquo;We must  continue to expand Co-Activity in Israel. I want to make it happen.&rdquo;</p>

She spoke for  both of us when she uttered the words, &ldquo;I feel well-used.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We were at dinner  with the team. The dinner capped a marathon week of email and phone  conversations with the client, weekend afternoons on the phone with my partner  analyzing team data and designing the day with the team, and working closely  with a subset of the team beforehand to create allies and role models. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And  now, we were celebrating breakthroughs in relationships that were unimaginable  a week ago. Parties that had been polarized&mdash;disenfranchised team members and  management&mdash;were willing to work together on long-standing problems. The &ldquo;us vs.  them&rdquo; stance had softened enough so that eye contact could be made with the  enemy and glasses raised for a toast. Cliques dissolved as teammates chose to  move to other tables to mingle. Team members felt heard. It was truly  remarkable.	</p>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What the system does by default is drop you into  the discussion somewhere that makes sense, depending on whether you are  subscribed to it or not and whether or not you've read it all. If there are  dozens of messages and you've read them all, does it make sense to drop you in  at the beginning? What the system does in that case is drop you in toward the  end. If it's a thread with hundreds of unread messages, in some circumstances  it will drop you in at, say, 20 from the end, so you don't get overwhelmed  reading all the old stuff.    
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You see, there are so many factors involved  given the unique user experience of activity throughout the system.

    <p>Dear D.D.:<br>
      First  and most importantly, what do you need in order to take care of yourself during  this period of flux and upset? This is a traumatic time for you and, as is true  of all people who are being traumatized, we need to take your needs into  consideration first. So, do you need some time off to just be with what's going  on? If you don't need some time off, do you need some hours each day to be with  yourself or other supportive people? Do you need more time with your own coach?  What support systems are available to you right now so that your needs are  being adequately served? Never underestimate taking care of yourself. It can  provide a helpful answer to so many of our problems.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Failure is the lack of achievement of a goal or  activity to which one committed oneself. Failure is often confused with being  wrong, morally shameful or bad. To fail merely means that you did not succeed  at that which you set out to do. It is an opportunity for reflection and  correction, which can then forward the action toward success.      
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">All levels of coaches are welcome&mdash;whether you've  just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very  new skills, or you&rsquo;re in the middle of Certification and you wish to explore them  deeper, or perhaps you've been doing this for years and it would be great to  have a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you. Also, since  this is an open forum, we'll be learning from each other. You are all  encouraged to participate and share your perspectives and experience.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">On the April 16 Health Pod Call, coaches shared info on the work they are doing in health and wellness. At the end of the call, interest was expressed to continue this discussion. It was exciting to hear about what is happening out there and to start investigating how to support each other in our quest to bring coaching to heath and wellness clients and practitioners. It was a call about abundance and Co-Activity. Please join us as we continue this discussion. Each coach on the call will be asked to share a brief description about the work they are currently doing or are planning to do. We will then use the time left on the call to discuss how we can support each other in this work. Brenda Olinek will host the call.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Our bodies have profound wisdom to share with us, if we'll listen. And, in order to listen well, we need to be in a state of being called mindfulness. Marlena Field, PCC, CPCC, will lead us in a conversation about mindfulness and how it can be used to deepen your clients’ experience of wholeness: body, mind and spirit. She will demonstrate an amazing way to heighten your clients’ experience of receiving an acknowledgment. This will be a cherished “take away” for you.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">We had such a great time on our last call about creativity and soul (and Oriah Mountain Dreamer's book What We Ache For) that we decided to continue the conversation this month. We will have an open conversation around creativity, soul and whatever else unfolds on the call. Some of the questions we left with were: How do we collapse our identity with the experience we are having? What happens when we immerse ourselves in creative activity (or, for that matter, coaching)? What is the time and space of soul? What seduces us away from creativity? What is the interplay of process and outcome? As before, we will point our discussion toward both coaching and our own creative endeavors.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Forwarding the action may occur through bringing the client back to the focus of his or her goal, or though reframing something in such a way that the client is free to take action. Acknowledging a client can also forward an action. The most powerful action forwarding occurs when a coach has the client DO IT NOW during the coaching session. This provides immediate support and immediate celebration once the action is taken.
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">All levels of coaches are welcome—whether you've just attended your Fundamentals weekend and want to learn more about these very new skills, or you’re in the middle of Certification and you wish to explore them deeper, or perhaps you've been doing this for years and it would be great to have a refresher to wake up your coaching. It's all there for you. Also, since this is an open forum, we'll be learning from each other. You are all encouraged to participate and share your perspectives and experience.

Kendall Summerhawk will dive deep into how you can take the guesswork out of setting fees (and quit caving in at the drop of a hat) in a simple, easy way “anyone” can use. If fact, you can easily charge 20-30-40 percent (and more) than you do right now, without the "what to charge worries." Why settle for less when you know you're worth more?!<p style="margin: 13 0 0 0"><font class="title"><b>Rainbow Pride Co-Active Coaches</b><br>

The aim of the shop is to SHOW people what coaches do. We shall offer open seminars, individual coaching and training. We need to have a shop front with huge windows, a large open space and several smaller rooms, so we have been looking for possible premises. On Wednesday, 30 May, whilst we walk from one possible shop location to the next, we shall talk about how we see this working.</td>
