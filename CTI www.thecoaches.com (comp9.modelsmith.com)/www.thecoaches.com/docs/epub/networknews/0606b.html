	Hello Coaches Near and Far!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Well, we just recently hit the 7,000 members mark. Woo Hoo! That’s a lot of conversation, asking for help, wearing your “leadership hat,” providing opportunities and tons of learning, learning, learning. As we pass these milestones, I am sent to reflect on what has occurred. The paradox of that is, I then instantaneously step into what can and will occur in the future. What is possible? What will be called forth in me? In us? I can think of two things right away—responsibility and respect. The container is here for us to play in. Let’s have a really great time giving and receiving all that is possible in this

</b>Hi, John. I see you signed up for the Spiral Dynamics Integral niche on the Co-Active Network. 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>John:</b>  <br>
  Yes, I’ve been in the niche for over a year now.
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Mary: </b><br>
    I haven’t been there as long as you, only four or five months, and I saw the first email posted for the group last week. What’s the deal? Is this niche doing anything at all?
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>John: </b><br>
      Not much as far as I can tell. I’m really curious about this Spiral. I’ve had several conversations with other coaches who are really excited about it. But I don’t know much about Spiral Dynamics Integral and very little has happened inside this niche.

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Denver Metro Co-Active Coaching Geographic Niche was created to form a community that builds successful coaching practices based on a strong foundation of coaching excellence, professionalism and shared business practices.  We wanted a regular opportunity to discuss and practice Co-Active Coaching skills.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our focus is on:
      <ul>
        <li>	The attraction model – attracting and retaining clients through coaching excellence, as well as personal and business mastery.</li>
        <li>	Creating a supportive community that raises the level of coaching and the success of the coaching profession.          </li>
        <li>	Keeping the learning magic alive – integrating left- and right-brain learning </li>

Not an unusual thing at all these days. Except I'm 42…42 and overweight…42, overweight, with no intention whatsoever of showing my belly to the world. What, you may ask, does a 42-year-old woman with a decidedly soft (OK, fat) tummy want with a belly piercing? Am I trying to recapture my youth, kind of a delayed teenage rebellion? Am I hoping a piercing will make me cool and hip rather than middle aged and boring? Was I drinking at the time, or did I lose a bet? No. I got the piercing because I really, really wanted it. Have for a really long time. Years in fact! I got it because it's fun and I wanted to stop putting off fun in my life until I got a better body. I got it because I am tired to my bones of trying to appease the unending choirs of critical inner judgments and criticisms of my body and what it deserves. Truly, I got the piercing as a way to create a relationship with my body from a place of acceptance and beauty (with maybe a bit of adolescent rebellion thrown in).  <i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>

      <i>&mdash;M.M. </i></p>
    <p>Dear M.M.: <br>
Ironically, the best motivation may come from encouraging him to keep doing what he is doing. What if your client has been working too hard and these diversions are much-needed mini-breaks? It may be possible that he has been too focused on his work of late and his fun and recreation needs are requiring some more positive attention. Respite can often be a helpful response to a stressed out situation.

Yet, it’s seductive as a coach to focus first on planning and forwarding the action, making sure the client is doing stuff and “getting results.”
