        <i>Dear Judith, </i><br>
        <i>I have a client who makes it  very hard for me to intrude and take charge. She speaks very quickly and hardly  takes a breath between sentences. Do you have any good intrusion suggestions? </i><br>
        <i>&mdash;V.B.</i></p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear V.B.,&nbsp;<br>
	  	     I couldn&rsquo;t help but immediately  notice the way you phrased the first sentence of your question. &ldquo;I have a  client <b><i>who makes it very hard for me</i></b>to intrude and take  charge.&rdquo; Notice the difference between your perspective and this perspective:  &ldquo;I have a hard time intruding and taking charge with one of my clients.&rdquo; Or  possibly even this perspective: &ldquo;I do not like to interrupt clients (or anyone  for that matter) because I believe that it is rude and impolite.&rdquo; In your  version, you have given your power to the client rather than owning your part  of the Co-Active coaching relationship. Do you see the difference between your  statement and taking responsibility for your choice to not interrupt her? </p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The coaching relationship is  based upon both the coach and the client giving 100% to each side of the work.  When you give away your power to the client, you are making the work harder for  yourself, while at the same time letting the client continue with an unhelpful  behavior. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the primary definition  of intrude is &ldquo;to put or force in inappropriately, especially without  invitation, fitness or permission.&rdquo; I would examine the alliance that you  designed with your client during your first coaching session. What permission  did you request in regard to intruding when your client is talking? It is  essential that your alliance allow you the power to use all of your skills and  tools for the benefit of your client. If you have not negotiated a way to  successfully intrude with your client, you have denied both yourself and your  client the full range of your coaching potential. </p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is very common for people to  assume that it is rude and impolite to interrupt people and intrude in a  conversation. This is probably a good rule to follow in normal conversation.  However, coaching is not a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conversation. It is a specific type of  conversation dedicated to deepening the client&rsquo;s learning and forwarding the  actions toward the client&rsquo;s desired goals. In this case, the rules of polite  conversation, don&rsquo;t necessarily apply. I like to think of intruding and taking  charge in metaphorical terms. If you were standing on a sidewalk engaged in a  conversation with a friend and suddenly you saw a teenager on a skateboard  quickly approaching your friend from behind, about to collide with her, would  you continue your conversation with her, hoping that she notices that she is  about to be hit by this skateboarder, or would you automatically grab her arm  and try to move her out of harm&rsquo;s way? When intrusion is necessary, it is not  only the safest thing to do, it is also an extremely polite gesture in the  context of the circumstances.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Assuming that you have now  stepped into your full power as a coach and you have successfully agreed that  you can intrude whenever you deem it necessary, just how does one effectively  intrude? I have several ways that have worked for me. The first and most  powerful is that I ask the client how they would like me to intrude when I deem  it necessary for the sake of the client. I then follow their suggestion while also  reminding them that this is what they have asked me to do in these  circumstances. Very rarely do I receive resistance, since the client has  specifically asked me to act in this way. </p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If my interjections of &rdquo;Excuse  me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Could you stop for a second?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble following you,&rdquo;  remain unheeded, then I resort to my next level of intrusion. That is to  clearly and loudly say, &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; until my client stops talking. I then say that  I am having a hard time hearing and keeping up with their part of the  conversation. Usually, when I employ this method, it is totally true. I make it  very clear that I am interested in what they have to say but that their  delivery is making it impossible for me to follow their message. When I can  hear what they are saying, and I intrude, I always tell my clients the reason  for my intrusion. Sometimes it is because they have gotten off track, sometimes  it&rsquo;s because I feel that they are avoiding a more painful topic, sometimes I  feel that they are trying to create an increased distance between us. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I am imagining that your client  frequently speaks quickly and doesn&rsquo;t often stop for breaks. It is possible  that she does this only with you or that she does this in other conversations,  as well? Perhaps she is unaware of her behavior. It could be very helpful for  her to know that she does this and to explore with her the impact of her  behavior. How do you feel when she is constantly talking and not letting you  interact with her? Have you thought about sharing your reaction with her? When  you don&rsquo;t intrude, what is her response to your coaching? Sometimes clients do  need a safe space to talk without interruption. However, if this happens every  session and there is no desire for your input, I would become quite curious  about how your client viewed your role as coach. Some clients are very  self-motivated and don&rsquo;t require much direction from their coaches. However, my  sense is that this may not be true for your client. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I know from my early days as a  coaching client that I often talked a lot in order to feel like I had control  of the conversation. Sometimes this was to avoid the fact that I was unable to  do my homework or that I did not want to talk about my insecurities around  promoting myself as a coach. I&rsquo;m sure that it was as painful for my coach as it  was for me when I didn&rsquo;t let him say much during those sessions in which I was  particularly avoidant. However, we finally did explore the matter and it opened  a great deal of space and opportunity for me to deal with my failures and my  fears. It was only after my coach intruded upon me that I was able to start to  grow my coaching practice. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Finally, if you find it  absolutely impossible to get your client to stop talking while you are coaching  her, I would send her an email immediately after the session and detail what  you see happening and what you want her to know. You can then pose several  questions for her to think about or give her an inquiry about intrusion that  she can work with for the coming week. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Once you have interrupted your  client, you must still intrude. Intrusion in this case means to create an  interpersonal interaction with your client that will take him or her in a more  helpful and powerful direction than the one just being pursued. This means that  you can do one of many things. You can articulate what is going on in the  moment. That might sound like, &ldquo;Client, every time you say that you want to  talk about your finances, you divert the conversation to some other area of  your life. I know that your finances are very important to you and I want to  support you in effectively dealing with them. Tell me specifically about your  income this month.&rdquo; Or, you can share what you are feeling in the moment:  &ldquo;Client, you have just been talking nonstop for the past 10 minutes and I have  tried to connect with you without success. I&rsquo;m left feeling very isolated at  the moment. I feel as if you don&rsquo;t really care about what I have to say. How  are you feeling right now?&rdquo; Or you can pose a powerful question. &ldquo;Client, on  the topic of your family, what do you really want from them at this time?&rdquo; It  is not enough to interrupt the flow of words coming at you. You must also move  the conversation forward and name what is happening in the moment. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Now that you&rsquo;ve interrupted your  client&rsquo;s monologue and inserted your experience, powerful questions, etc., it&rsquo;s  equally important to take charge. Don&rsquo;t slip back to a more passive stance.  Stay directed with your client, both in content and in action. This can take  considerable resolve on your part, but it is essential if you want to create an  atmosphere in which your client can succeed at his or her goals. Although it  may seem counterintuitive and impolite to intrude and take charge, it is an  excellent form of jarring the client&rsquo;s usual perspective and behavior so that  the client gets a fresh view and hopefully new energy for the pursuit of her or  his deepest desires.</p>
