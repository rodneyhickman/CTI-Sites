	  	   <p><b><i>Coaches Are Leading Social  Change in Alberta, Canada</i></b><b></b><br>
    by Philip Durnford</a></p>
	  	   <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0702/geo-lg.jpg" alt="Philip Durnford" width="103" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"><p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Imagine coaching  someone who has no access to a personal telephone, whose routine is navigated  by meal times, opening and closing times and the probable length of a line-up. This  is a person who may have a rarely viewed email address and has, at best, a  planning horizon of two hours. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is 30% likely  that the client is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol and/or gambling or is in  recovery from an addiction. It is also 30% possible that the client has been  diagnosed with some form of mental disorder; commonly depression or bipolar  disorder, occasionally ADD/ADHD or even schizophrenia. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As to the  question of jail time, it is likely. Some abuse? Probably. On the plus side, it  is 30% likely that the client is a graduate of at least a degree level education  and 55% likely that the person works for a living. On the other hand, add that  this person probably lives in a shared space, with others in a similar situation  and has no personal space outside of his or her bed. It is even possible this  person shares one room with 200 others and sleeps on a washable,  plastic-covered foam mat each night. </p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On first meeting  this person, you might easily notice dirt, or a roughness about the edges of  the clothing, or the whiff of something you are not used to. Where might you  have seen him before? The mall? Walking, head bent and purposeless on deserted  streets as you drove by? Panhandling? Or was it bottle picking from one of  those garbage cans? More likely, this is the first time you ever noticed. Can  you imagine it?
		  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If  you are like me, parts of that passage were toe-curlingly difficult to imagine;  I almost wanted to turn my head away. In fact, if you are like most people,  when presented with these circumstances in full view,  you would want to do one of three things: fight, flee or fix. And we can  probably guess what that is about; in my case it is all about me and my fear of  my own vulnerability. 
	  	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> And  this is why a group of courageous coaches from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, are  redefining themselves as coaches, absolutely cutting through layers of  prejudice and fear in order to soften their gaze and see, with loving kindness,  the tremendous talents, dreams and possibilities of future world leaders, who  all happen to be homeless. In fact it&rsquo;s easy, if you decide. Yes, there are  logistical challenges and these are simply opportunities to discover new ways  of defining a coaching relationship 
	  	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The  power of the work we are doing here lies in the banner under which we all  stand, our &ldquo;stake,&rdquo; if you will: when we choose to see greatness and beauty, we  will experience greatness and beauty. It feels to us like the calling forth  version of &ldquo;the client is naturally creative, resourceful and whole.&rdquo; 
	  	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And  yes, we do have an agenda, and I must stress it is not to fix homelessness  (although that would be a nice-to-have). We want to invite the public to treat  more people in their lives with loving kindness. It starts by acknowledging the  human over there, and not the object of ridicule, hate or avoidance. We are  leading by example, through the examples of people we see shining with power  despite their difficult circumstances. 
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  If  I&rsquo;m a John Doe, who shouts &ldquo;get a job&rdquo; at a &ldquo;bum&rdquo; one week and the next lauds  the same person who&rsquo;s now seen as a social entrepreneur, we get to legitimately  ask John and everyone the question: &ldquo;That person there is the same person you  called a bum last week. So what&rsquo;s different now? He didn&rsquo;t change, you did. Who  else could you decide to see as of value in your daily life?&rdquo; This is exciting  because it will be like group coaching, through the media, inviting a whole  community to shift perspective together. 
	  	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Of  course it will take time and it would be tempting to say that it won&rsquo;t be easy.  But, you know, it does not feel difficult. Thanks to my training in Co-Active  Leadership, I am really noticing the power of having that banner, that stake,  to stand under, of seeing greatness and beauty. 
	  	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> At  this time of writing there are eight coaches working pro bono with one or two  homeless clients each and nine more just signed on to begin in early February. We  are intentionally creating a coaches learning community to sustain and grow us.  Behind the scenes, we have a professional fundraiser, staff from homeless  shelters, a graphic designer and an increasing number of NPOs behind us. In the  next phase, we shall be networking ourselves into a corporate sponsorship deal  in order for coaches to get paid to coach even more wonderful people.  
	  	    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> The  coaching is just the start of the movement we are creating in order to bring  about a shift in public perception towards loving kindness. 
	  	     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We  are creating a project in four, sustainable &ldquo;strategic movements,&rdquo; or  objectives, of which the coaching we are building is a factor in the first two:</p>
	  	   <ol>
	  	     <li>Empowering  homeless people.</li>
	  	     <li>Networking  &amp; facilitating projects, in community, designed  and led by homeless people.</li>
	  	     <li>Inviting  a shift of public perception towards homelessness and homeless people.</li>
	  	     <li>Inviting  the public to the possibilities of loving kindness.</li>
      </ol>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This  project is called Stone Soup, after the European folk tale, and is a metaphor  for voluntary contribution, appreciation of gifts and the richness and  unpredictability of the reward.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are being  rewarded already with rich learning about ourselves as coaches. I have learned  to go where the fear is. I know what &ldquo;the client is naturally creative,  resourceful and whole&rdquo; actually feels like now. I know how it feels and impacts  to address the greatness and beauty in someone and I can reproduce that feeling  at-will.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Coaches can  change the world.</p>
	  	 <p style="margin: 30 0 0 0"><b>Phil Durnford</b> is the founder and Director of Coaching of the Stone Soup Project and  is now just one of 21 coaches, fundraisers and other professionals who are  bringing about this work. He qualified CPCC while moving from Norway to Canada.  He has since graduated from the Co-Active Leadership Program (he is a Hawk). He  keeps his tools sharp by coaching amazing leaders in an impasse, and his big  work is to bring about the spread of love and purpose in communities.</p>	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&nbsp;</p>
