               <i>&mdash; Leah Mwangi, Grassroots  African Women&rsquo;s Conference, Bondo, Kenya, December 2006</i></p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The word <i>safari</i> in  Kiswahili means to go on a journey or expedition. My recent safari to East  Africa in December 2006, was a series of miracles along the way. Never did I  dream that my coaching and leadership education I completed five years ago,  would lead me to the first rural Grassroots African Women&rsquo;s Conference in  Bondo, Kenya. My journey to East Africa was to give back to young women some of  the gifts that I had been given.</p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The world is waking up to the importance of educating girls,  and my work in Tanzania and Kenya with impoverished rural girls is on the  cutting edge of this awakening. The programs that I have created for Maasai  girls in East Africa have grown much bigger than my original goal to start a  scholarship program. Five years ago, I had a vision to create a program for  secondary school girls in Tanzania. The impetus came from my Leadership  training and the opportunity from Global Partners for Development, a nonprofit  working in East Africa. Out of this profound experience, an idea was born: take  the training that I had been given and pass it on to girls who would have no  opportunity to become leaders in their own lives. I started with a small pilot  in 2002 of 43 girls and today I have enrolled 320 young women into the program.  In 2004, we expanded into Kenya, and in 2007, we are headed to Uganda.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The idea for the first Grassroots African Women&rsquo;s Conference  was born out of the desire to give rural women a voice in designing their  future. When I first heard about it, the thought I had was &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; The  conference presented a perfect opportunity to introduce leadership training for  some of my scholarship girls. It was a vision that I had held for a very long  time. </p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The theme for the conference was empowering women in issues  that affected them on a daily basis: HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, micro loans, illiteracy  and economic development. Since the beginning of the scholarship program, it  was my vision to empower the African community to make decisions on the girls&rsquo;  behalf. It was, as I could see, the only way for the program to become  self-sustaining. Thus, I let Africa decide who would be chosen to go to the  conference based on their criteria. When the time came and I actually met the  girls in Bondo, the excitement was electric. The 14 girls that attended had  never been out of their villages and now they were at a conference with more  than 500 rural African women, learning about important issues that would impact  their lives.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">During the next four days, I worked with a team of women who  were also at the conference and did three workshops with the scholarship girls.  The first one was on communication. I modeled how a simple introduction could  be powerful. This exercise gave me an opportunity to really listen from another  perspective, taking into account the cultural differences. I sat back and let  them evaluate each other. By the end of the first workshop, they had formed a  community, working together to practice their newly learned skills.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On the second day, the girls came in excited about what they  were learning at the conference. They worked in pairs to put on paper concepts,  insights and ideas, and it was inspiring to watch them write down what was  important to them. For the first time, they had the freedom to design and  create without being judged.</p>
	  	   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The third workshop was a celebration, as one of the girls  had a birthday. Thus, we decided to give her a party as a reward for the hard  work that had been done there. It was the last day that we would be working  with them and we wanted it to be special. They squealed with joy as they ate  cake and talked about being together for the last time. We also worked that day  on using what they had learned to take back to their community. In small  groups, the girls came up with projects that they would initiate based on the  themes from the conference. </p>
	  	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For the six from Tanzania, it was a flight home, to attend  the 3rd Education Forum in Arusha. Their role was to present to the  community and their respective schools what they had learned. Thus, it was at  the Forum that I witnessed the birth of self-confidence and empowerment that  would hopefully be a part of their daily lives. They did not disappoint me. More  than 200 people attended, including two members of Parliament. The girls stood  up in front of the audience, hands trembling and talked about having a future  with the right to be heard. It was remarkable, and I will never forget the  passion and the power of their words. This experience was the culmination of a  seed that had been planted five years ago in my Leadership Training. Today, it is  a reality.</p>
	  	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If I hadn&rsquo;t taken the initiative to &ldquo;leap&rdquo; into a vast new  place to play, I would not have had the honor to meet and work with these  incredible young women. It is my belief that coaches come to this work for  different reasons, and often what they discover is wrapped in a dazzling  package.</p>
