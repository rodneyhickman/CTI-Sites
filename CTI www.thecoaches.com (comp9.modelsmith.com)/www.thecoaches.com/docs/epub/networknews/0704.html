Hello Friends,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
Have you sprung into action? This is the season for birth and renewal. The metamorphosis of life continues its miraculous cycle. What are you birthing this season? How will you transform into your most beautiful self? It may take a season, a year, a decade. Who are you becoming? 

      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Think of this: who is the future self you are today that your child or young adult would have longed to be or to meet? Who would you have yearned to know and love? A colleague of mine shared this concept of looking at myself today as the future self I have become and am today. Pretty cool, huh? Of course, I have a future self who is loving me and creating me today for all of the tomorrows that lie ahead…ready to meet me, there. I love to ponder this as I crack my current eggshell into another stage of life. The mystery of it all, along with conscious choice, brings life, transformation and excitement. Keep blooming!

        —Jim Rohn
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">One day in the summer of 2002, I walked into the world of Co-Activity and haven’t looked back. It was a venture into all the things that could possibly be dreamed, imagined and attained. It was a step into the arms of a community that supports, encourages and challenges its members to not settle, to look past mediocre, to reach for what you want. Over the past five years, the look and feel of my coaching business has changed, but what has remained consistent is my commitment to the concept of co-activity and community.
      <p>Back in 2002, there were few coaches in the greater Edmonton area, let alone CTI-trained ones. In those days, we scurried back to Vancouver for courses and looked to their community for support. Lately, though, Co-Active coaches seem to be springing up everywhere in our backyard, and so it seems timely to create a Northern Alberta Co-Active Community. </p>

I guess that I have built up a picture of her in my mind and I don’t want reality to change it. What are your thoughts on this matter?

    <p>Dear J.V.:<br>
     It is not uncommon to have a long and satisfying coaching relationship by phone and to never meet your client in person. It is also true that many coaches and clients do decide to meet one another in person. This can occur prior to beginning the coaching relationship, during the coaching relationship or after their coaching relationship has ended. I have coached many people and never met them just as I have coached people for long periods of time and then met them in person.

Play is simple. It's powerful, and it gives us direct access to our joyful, authentic Self. Vince Gowmon, CPCC, will be leading this fabulous interactive call. He'll be sharing some of the creative, fun and empowering games that he uses in his coaching, and which you will also be able to use in your own coaching and workshop design. To help get you into the playful mood for the call, Vince asks that you watch the movie <i>Patch Adams</i>, starring Robin Williams, as preparation!

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">We've bumped our May book club call up to April. This call, led by Kathy Loh, CPCC, will focus on the book: <i>What We Ache For: Creativity and the Unfolding of Your Soul,</i> by Oriah Mountain Dreamer, author of <i>The Invitation</i> and other amazingly inspirational books. As always, you do not need to have read the book to participate in the call AND it will enrich your experience on the call if you have. I highly recommend it for anyone who is finding themselves or their clients full of ideas/desire and stalled on manifestation. This book is both a calling and a how-to, full of inspiration, exercises and contemplation.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">As ORSC starts to move independently from CTI, Marita & Faith will be hosting information calls for the community on a monthly basis. These are meant to help keep you abreast of the change as it happens, and get your input for some of what is trying to happen! The remaining two calls will be this day and May 30, also at 8 a.m. Pacific. There are exciting new plans for the future—including ORSC certification—so stay tuned!

This date is in tandem with the memorial being held in California. Please indicate your intention to attend, as there will be refreshments, so we need to know the number. There will be a book to sign at the event. If you cannot attend, you can send a message to Wendy Fuller, <a href="mailto:wendyr_fuller@yahoo.ca" class="orange">wendyr_fuller@yahoo.ca</a>, to be included in our book, which will be sent to CTI.
