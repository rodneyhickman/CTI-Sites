Happy New Year,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’ve just stepped across the line into a new year. Now how conscious do you want to be with it? What are you committed to? No kidding. What are you dreaming for yourself?  Really go there and let yourself have it. Whatever “it” is. Let the dynamic tension pull you forward into an exciting, exhilarating and breathtaking dream. A deep wanting. Perhaps actually creating this experience right where you are would ground your commitment. I actually know it would. Create a line to step across. I invite you. Get really grounded and feel your wanting down into your bones. What is in the air that keeps you compelled? Be careful of that icky saboteur that’s wanting to hold you back from your magnificence. Of course, we can’t cross that line until we’re willing to let something go. What are you willing to leave behind? Really. Again, no kidding.

This affects everyone: health insurers and public health agencies see disproportionate use of emergency rooms, general medical and psychiatric services; employers pay for substance abuse treatment and need their employees to return to full functioning; and the criminal justice system wants less crime, incarceration and parole violations.
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">At home, families want to live without the worries, embarrassment, violence and financial concerns that go hand-in-hand with substance abuse. And addicts themselves have needs and wants. They want relief from discomfort caused by the direct effects of substance abuse, as well as improved personal and social functioning, resulting in fewer problems. Everyone wants the costs of addiction to come down, especially the cost of repeated treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of addicts relapse soon after treatment.

I am sure you are hearing this sentence a lot these days. As many of us do at this time every year, I start to review the previous year’s balance sheet and start questioning myself. What did I do? What didn’t I do? Why didn’t I do it? If I really wanted to, what would I do? Start making new resolutions for the coming year. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Since the beginning of December, I am in this mood. But this year, I have a different interest for New Year’s resolutions because I think it is a good way to start a coaching relationship as well. Therefore, I decided to do a little search; I wrote “new year resolutions” in the Google search box and was amazed by the result. This topic is extremely popular! Another surprising discovery for me are the New Year’s resolutions made all around the world that are very similar:
      <ol>
        <li>Lose       weight and get in better physical shape.</li>
           <li>Stick       to a budget.</li>
           <li>Reduce       debt.</li>
           <li>Enjoy       more quality time with family and friends.</li>
           <li>Find       soul mate.</li>
           <li>Quit       smoking.</li>
           <li>Find       better work.</li>
           <li>Learn       something new.</li>
           <li>Volunteer       and help others.</li>

Allow silence after a client speaks and listen to what emerges into the silence. During a telephone call, let the silence increase and be amazed at the wisdom that surfaces. In a workshop, provide silence after those provocative questions. What do you do with silence?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Did you take some time to think about the question? Or did you say, I’m too busy?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What is silence? It’s the absence of sound; a time when we hear something, like the breeze or a coyote howl, that makes us aware of the silence around us; a quiet mind that allows you to be aware of the external silence; and the internal stillness from which another voice, not your own, speaks.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’ve been getting some inquires for support lately from members who are noticing that the email seems to be quieter than usual. They’re wondering if email traffic has changed significantly on the site. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Well, I can say that it hasn’t changed any more than the natural trends of the impact of holidays. Check in with your email provider to ensure that any email address with “@coactivenetwork.com” is listed in your “white pages.” The email system on the Co-Active Network has not changed and 99.9% of the time is not responsible for you not getting email notifications from it. There are myriad applications, spam filters, server systems, etc., that often modify their settings ongoingly. There are also members who have email forwarding features/rules and multiple accounts on the site that have an impact on email notifications.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For example, <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a> has not been receiving email notifications from any niche or geographic community for about a month. After emails to <i>my</i> tech support, it was once again proven to be on my user-side of things. Our IT guy had upgraded my system with an application that unintentionally thwarted the delivery of emails from the Co-Active Network in service of clearing other spam from being received. Lots of learning!
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course, I’ll do my best and am happy to work with you with any site-related issues. <i>And</i> there are times when the “mystery” of technology baffles me, too! Thank you for your emails of acknowledgement, support and love. We’re having a lot of fun with this global community. Aren’t we?

    <p>Dear N. S., <br>
I have two immediate answers to your question, both of which come from different perspectives. My first answer is one that probably will not sound like a coach-like response. I’m not sure that change in the context that you have mentioned it merits such a good reputation. When I think about how long it has taken me to make lasting changes in my life, it usually has been a long and drawn out process with many stops and starts. In addition, the motivating factors for the change were usually external and not particularly organic. I know this experience is not personal to me. My clients have also had similar experiences of change.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0"><i>Challenging </i>involves requesting that a client stretch way beyond his or her self-imposed limits. Frequently, in the face of a challenge, clients will respond with a counter offer that is greater than they initially would have allowed themselves to make otherwise.
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This is not a replacement for your training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome, whether you’ve trained with CTI or not. Also, since this is an open forum, we'll be learning from each other; you are all encouraged to participate and share your perspectives and experience.

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0"><i>Championing.</i> When you do this with your clients, you stand up for them when they doubt or question their abilities. Despite the client's self-doubt, the coach knows clearly who the client is and that he or she is capable of much more than the client thinks. When the client is in the valley, the coach is on the next hill, waving a flag and saying, “Come on, you can make it!”
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">This is not a replacement for your training, but an enhancement, designed to help all of us deepen our learning so that we can create more powerful coaching with our clients. All levels of coaches are welcome, whether you’ve trained with CTI or not. Also, since this is an open forum, we'll be learning from each other; you are all encouraged to participate and share your perspectives and experience.
