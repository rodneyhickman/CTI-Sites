	  <strong>Spiral Dynamics? What? </strong>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0507/images/niche-elaine-june05.jpg" align="right" class="border1">Co-Activity...Co-Active Coaching can change the world! OK, so lots of us believe this. But how? Are there instructions? How about a map? Our community myths say “one person at time.” Will that be enough? Don’t we need to have an impact on communities and organizations and countries, too? And how about all the other people we know are doing similar work? How does it all fit together? Are we a vehicle for something major that’s happening developmentally in our world? What is the consciousness that is expanding through us? </em>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Models...maps, do you love them the way I do? I’ve tried to figure out what makes them so compelling to me and I think it’s that, since everything seems connected to everything else through my eyes, I need help distinguishing one piece from another. I need some context to put the pieces in for them to make sense. The world is complex and getting more complex all the time. Who talks about this stuff? Where can I have this conversation? Especially, where can I have this conversation with others in the Co-Active Coaching community?

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Well, Cherie Beck, Clive Prout and I have created a place for the conversation. And we have been exploring what we believe are the best of the “maps.” I am wanting you to be excited, too. So, here is our invitation to you to come play in the Spiral Dynamics Integral community. And an invitation to join us in a pilot of the first “Spiral Wizard” workshop...combining the science of Spiral Dynamics with the magic of Co-Activity.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What are the models? We’ve picked two....Ken Wilber’s Integral Psychology model (now “spread” to Integral Business, Integral Medicine, Integral Art, Integral just about anything...) and Don Beck’s Spiral Dynamics model. Both have been around for a while and both have solid research foundations. Makes them both credible and, in their clarity, compelling. And the best part is that either model comes more alive and creates greater impact in the world when applied through the lens of Co-Activity!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Wilber is the “map maker’s map maker.” Maybe you’ve read his book, <em>A Brief History of Everything</em>. He speaks to lines of development: that we acquire and master many competencies at varying rates and speeds and to varying degrees. We may be highly developed cognitively and less so emotionally; we may be highly developed along a
spiritual “line” and less so musically, or mathematically, or athletically. No right and
wrong, but huge diversity. 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Most human development researchers postulate that our development happens in stages...or phases...or levels. Wilber has compared more developmental research models than anyone else I’ve found. And he looks for the integration points through the lens of “all of these models, developed by human beings who are passionate about learning, must be at least partially right.” You can see, can’t you, how I began seeing the overlap between Wilber’s work and CTI’s Rule No. 1 of nobody gets to be wrong?

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And that leads us to Spiral Dynamics. In the 1950s, a psychologist named Clare Graves began studying personality development, looking for some way to fit all the different personality theories into a whole. His hypothesis worked something like this: our personalities are built somehow in concert with the life conditions we face. Our values
(our most important beliefs, who we believe ourselves to be at our best) are expressions of this relationship between life conditions and the human choices we make. Part of human development is explained by movement between “levels” of  value sets. He called these valueMEMEs. Interestingly, these levels seem to work evolutionarily through time, as well as individually as we grow and mature. 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Don Beck works with Grave’s theory now and has added theoretical depth, color-named  labels AND more practical application. Currently, Beck speaks more of “complexity thinking” than he does of values sets. We develop our ability to meet complexity as our life conditions become more complex and more chaotic. Beck believes that we are at a time in evolutionary history when we (humanity) may begin a leap into a “second tier” of development where our focus moves away from survival of my individual self and toward survival of the whole, the human species, the planet. 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And he believes that life conditions now both support and require that leap. I say, who better than those of us who have and are committed to practicing the skills and contexts of the Co-Active model to lead the way. This is a learning edge...the place where we create the path and start laying the pavement. Come play!
