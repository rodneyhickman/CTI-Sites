    </strong>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0507/images/musingmichael.jpg" width="93" height="120" align="right" class="border3">I've just returned from Norway and the European ICF conference. Coaching feels as healthy as it ever has. There was a big CTI presence, both as presenters and attendees, not to mention great workshops, a Viking feast and some awesome dancing.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Coaching also feels doomed.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>A Cottage Industry</em><br>
Let me share a story from another industry and another time. In 1730, cloth making was a cottage industry throughout England. Many individual weavers were scattered around the country creating cloth for their clients. Over the next 50 years, a series of technical revolutions would sweep through the industry. First, John Kay's flying shuttle in 1733 started things, quickly followed by Crompton's mule which produced large and cost-effective quantities of fine, strong yarn.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a result of these changes, by 1800, the number of workers needed to turn wool into yarn shrank by 80%. From 1780 to 1812, the cost of making cotton yarn dropped 90%.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The obvious benefit of the industrial revolution was that quality cloth become available and affordable to the broader public for the first time. The price paid for this benefit was the loss of most of the industry’s traditional jobs—although new jobs and new opportunities opened up for a smaller number of people.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I don't need to point out the obvious parallels. As a bottom line, I strongly believe that the coaching profession (as we know it) is quickly approaching a point where it must either evolve to the next iteration, or begin to decay and be replaced by whatever's next (because you should know that there is something next—coaching is not the end of the line).

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>“You’re All Individuals”</em><br>
Part of my frustration with coaching is just how homogenous we are as a profession. Sometimes coaching reminds me of that scene from Monty Python's<em> Life of Brian</em>. Brian, who's been mistaken as the Messiah, is being followed by an enormous crowd. Desperate for them to leave, he shouts out to them "You are all individuals!" In response to which, the crowd yells back in unison, "Yes, yes, we are all individuals!”

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The consequences of this are significant. First, it's one of the reasons that so many coaches are struggling to survive as entrepreneurs. To the public, we all look the same.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Two Ghettos</em><br>
But more importantly, in my opinion, is the damage this is doing to the profession. It keeps coaching stuck in two ghettos—middle-aged, middle-class white men (a.k.a. executive coaching); and middle-aged, middle-class white women (a.k.a. life coaching). For coaching to thrive and grow as a profession, it must find new forms and expressions so that it can touch a much wider range of people from different races, classes and countries.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I have in my mind something called Coaching 2.0. This is the next iteration of coaching, a form that will help coaches thrive and coaching spread far more broadly throughout the world. I don't know what it looks like, nor do I need to know. I do know that each one of us has the opportunity (and I would say the responsibility) to start creating the diverse forms of coaching that will be encompassed by Coaching 2.0.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Business Model</em><br>
So how do you go about creating this different and diverse form of coaching? One place to look is at the business model that underpins most of today’s coaching. A business model basically considers four elements: who you’re coaching, what you’re offering, how you’re getting it to your audience and how much you’re charging.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">From my experience, one business model dominates our industry (at least in North America where I’m based). I’m not sure exactly where this comes from—maybe the Coaching Gods up on high—but it looks something like this:
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0"> •	The Who: The “two ghettos” mentioned.</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">•	The What: “Classic” coaching, that is one-on-one conversation.</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">•	The How:  By telephone or face-to-face, 3-4 times a month, 30-45 minutes a call.</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">• The How Much: $100-300 per month for life coaching, twice that for corporate coaching. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here are some questions you can start considering in terms of changing your business model to be different:
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">•	Who are you coaching? (Who's being ignored? Who’s bored of Coaching 1.0?)</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">•	What are you offering them in terms of services and products? (What needs to be added?  What needs to change?)</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">•	How are you bringing coaching to the world? (What distinct experience are you offering?  What if you had to use a 21st Century technology? What if you had to be in contact with your client for 10x as long? Or 1/10th as long?)</p>
  <p style="margin: 5 0 0 0">• How much are you charging? (What if you had to sell coaching for $1 a shot? What if you had to charge 100x your current rate?) </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">These are just places to start. My wish is for you to be mindful of your business model, so that you can start being different from the coaches around you, and so that ultimately coaching can be offered beyond the two ghettos.
