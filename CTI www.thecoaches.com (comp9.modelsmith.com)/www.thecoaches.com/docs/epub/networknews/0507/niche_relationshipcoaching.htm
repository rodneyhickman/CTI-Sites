    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">      <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0505/images/niche.gif" width="112" height="83" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="" vspace="10">    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Relationship is everywhere and it wants to be coached! Ever since I started thinking of myself as a relationship coach, my conversations about coaching have produced a lot more tangible results. It has been a journey that I couldn’t have imagined, and it has led me to the discovery of widely different coaching settings, all tied together by relationship.     
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It all started about a year and a half ago when I felt called to work with business partnerships. I was working with two small business co-founders and we were doing great work together. For me, it combined the creative aspect of business with the juice of relationship, and it seemed like there couldn’t be a better niche. So I went ahead and created a web site aimed exclusively at business partnerships and directed all my attention to this market. I felt I finally was doing things “right”—I had chosen a niche! Not only that, it was a business-related niche so presumably there was money to be made.
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Still holding this intention, I moved to Mexico (where I’m from) and started talking about what I was doing and listening attentively to what was happening with relationships everywhere. My mother, who is a big ally of mine, also started talking about what I was doing with her friends and acquaintances. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Interested people started to show up from the unlikeliest of places. First, a mother asked me to coach her two 10- and 11-year-old daughters. A couple of weeks later, I had breakfast with the principals of a school and I was brought in to coach their teachers and administrators as a group. After that, a company CEO heard about my work and he brought me in to coach his leadership team. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The need became even more diverse. A couple of months ago, my parents decided they wanted to learn the content of what I was doing, so they got together a group of six couple-friends for a workshop with me. So now I’m working with couples too. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As my mother was looking for couples for the workshop, a wonderful friend of hers said attending as a teenager’s parent was higher up on her list than attending as a wife. So she got that workshop going with five other moms who were on the same boat. Another fabulous mother took it a step further and said she wanted a workshop that her teenage kids could attend along with her. And she got that group together. I only show up to give the workshops they want. I had never done workshops before in my life, but I suppose that after attending several CTI courses, a lot of what needs to happen in a workshop starts to rub off on you. Additionally, the feeling of having something really unique to offer (especially after having taken CTI’s Relationship Systems courses) was much stronger than the fear of screwing up.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Through all these transitions into different coaching contexts, the relationship coaching community has been an incredible resource. I need only ask my fellow coaches in the community about the new situations I’m going into for them to share their own expertise and experience. The advice I’ve gotten has made a tangible difference in the way I’ve shown up to my workshops.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For all the emphasis there is on coaches becoming good marketers, there is something to be said for finding people to do the marketing for you, especially when they are doing it because they are eager to learn. The other thing that has made a big difference is that relationship is often both a cause of the biggest fulfillments, as well as the largest disappointments. In my experience, people understand the importance of relationship a lot better than the importance of “coaching.” 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And everything is relationship and in relationship—from the most minute subatomic particle to the most grand scale phenomena. In a wider departure from my original vision of coaching business partnerships, I have now become passionate about large-scale community relationships. Kim Fowler, a wonderful colleague started a conversation in our community about the relationship between the “right” and the “left.” Now we are looking to take it a step further with community events in our own geographic areas. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Lastly, some of the most important work I’ve been doing has been around the relationships we have with different aspects of our own selves. Making friends with the aspect of me that at some point felt permanently damaged, has been some of the most powerful work I have ever done. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I hope that through my experiences you have gotten a sense of what is happening in our land of Relationship Coaching. There is so much more than couples coaching, which might be the first thing that comes to mind. It also includes working with business partnerships, teams, groups, families, parents, kids, communities and even our very own selves. Additionally, it is a way of marketing.  

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So come learn and share with us. What is life asking you to do differently around your relationships? How are you using the relationship lens to market yourself? What recurring relationship challenges do you see your clients facing? We want to play with you regardless of whether you have taken CTI’s Relationship Systems curriculum or not.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Sending you (and myself!) the best wishes for continued effortless work.
