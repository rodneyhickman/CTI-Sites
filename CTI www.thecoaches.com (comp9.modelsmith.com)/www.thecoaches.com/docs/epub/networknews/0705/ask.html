	    <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0609/judith.jpg" width="108" height="112" align="right">My personal life is blowing up, and I can feel the impact this is having on my coaching. My presence is down; my curiosity is down; my ability to view myself as creative, resourceful and whole is down. I feel I'm not serving my clients well. Before my calls, I muster myself, but I feel the creep of the down-ness set in and hold it ALL down. Can you help shed light on managing this kind of situation?<br>
	  &mdash;D.D.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear D.D.:</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">First  and most importantly, what do you need in order to take care of yourself during  this period of flux and upset? This is a traumatic time for you and, as is true  of all people who are being traumatized, we need to take your needs into  consideration first. So, do you need some time off to just be with what's going  on? If you don't need some time off, do you need some hours each day to be with  yourself or other supportive people? Do you need more time with your own coach?  What support systems are available to you right now so that your needs are  being adequately served? Never underestimate taking care of yourself. It can  provide a helpful answer to so many of our problems.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    Second,  I assume that you are not the only person who has or will undergo domestic  strife. Given that, you are now a human laboratory for others in the same position.  How is what you are going through in the moment, helpful for your clients? If  your situation is not directly similar to that of your clients, it may be  indirectly similar. I imagine that you are feeling some sense of major loss.  This is a topic that most people are afraid to deal with. Here you are in the  midst of things being radically shaken up and you have a front-row seat on the  action. What's the learning here? Even if it is very early in your process, you  can just note what is happening. That's an excellent skill for your clients to  learn, too. Being present to all of one's experience enhances life even when  being present entails a great deal of pain or &quot;down-ness,&quot; as you so  wonderfully put it.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    As  you probably know from other down times, downs end. They may not end as quickly  as you want them to end, but they do end. The trick is to stay in touch with  the rest of you that is so much bigger than the down. This is where your coach,  your friends and family can have a positive impact. They can remind you of who  you are and not have you completely characterize yourself by your current  depressed mood. Having outlived many down periods in my own life, I know the  joy of surviving and even thriving&nbsp;because of them.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    For  instance, I had a down when I was recently in the hospital. I got really  curious about what my down was about. Ostensibly, I was in pain and didn't want  to be in the hospital. However, at a deeper level, I was feeling upset&nbsp;by  the fact that my body had a different agenda than my mind. I had been  forgetting to include my body in my daily negotiations about what was important  and my gut finally said, &quot;Enough! If this is the only way to get you to  pay attention then this is the way it has to be.&quot; At that point, although  still in pain, I started to feel better&nbsp;and at least a little bit more  directed in taking care of myself when I got out of the hospital.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    Although  you may feel like your mood and mental state are getting in the way of your  being the best coach that you can be right now, you also might be opening up  new sensitivities that weren't available before this upset. Pay attention to  what you are listening to in your clients. Pay attention also to what your  saboteurs are saying about you and your clients. If you can listen to the  saboteur's voice non-judgmentally, you are likely to reap information that will  help you be with your clients in possibly a different way.<br>
	    As  another example, I am having increased difficulty hearing these days. (You are  lucky to catch me with so many&nbsp;physical traumas of late!)&nbsp;My gremlin  is very loudly and incessantly telling me that I am being a bad coach since I  can't hear as well as I used to hear. When I stopped and actually listened to  my gremlin's concern, I found out that my gremlin was most&nbsp;worried about  my sense of disconnection when I can't hear. Through this listening process, I  found some helpful information about what I could do to increase my sense of  connection with my clients in those moments. Given that connection is my top  value, this was a very important piece of work for me.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    So,  my best suggestions for now are: 1) take care of yourself, 2) stay present to  what is going on, 3) get curious about your process and see if there is any way  to use your experience to further your clients' learning, and 4) take some  action that implements your learning.<br>
	    Mostly  importantly, be kind to yourself. You are working in the midst of what I  imagine is equivalent to open heart surgery. Don't expect to be working at your  peak levels. If you really can't work for a couple of days or longer, take some  time off. Do what you need to do to heal. This is very important. Ask yourself  what would be best for you right now. I believe that your inner wisdom knows  more than I do in this matter.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	    I'm sending good thoughts your way. I know that you will  make this situation work for you and your clients. Let me know if you need  further support.&nbsp;</p>
