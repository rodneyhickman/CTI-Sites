      </b></h2>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0705/niche07-w.jpg" width="124" height="84" align="right">It seems that everywhere I  turn, I am hearing about the importance of &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo;&mdash;especially at work,  where many of us &ldquo;know&rdquo; we can&rsquo;t really be authentic. It wouldn&rsquo;t be  &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; It would be too risky. It could be career-limiting. So what is  going on? This month&rsquo;s Fast Company  cover even cites the &ldquo;Selling of Authenticity&rdquo; by Nike, BMW and Starbucks.	  </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What are we talking about here  anyway? Webster defines authenticity as &ldquo;true to one&rsquo;s own personality, spirit  or character,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not false or imitation.&rdquo; On a recent niche call with about  50 people, we began by talking about authenticity, playing with different  definitions and hearing different perspectives. Later on that same call, we  heard a story about a challenge, a choice and the differences it had made for  the teller. We shifted to a different level of listening and hearing. We felt  and understood in a different way what authenticity really was.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  Why is authenticity important  in organizations? From a very pragmatic perspective, organizations are always  seeking ways to be more efficient and effective, to improve quality and to provide  a more satisfying experience for their employees, customers and suppliers. We  have tried, and we learn in business schools, many techniques and tools for  addressing these needs, including such things as LEAN, Six-Sigma, recognition  programs and high performance work teams. All of these fall short of their potential  because we choose within the cultures we are co-creating to hold back a lot of  who we are&mdash;to stay in our heads and avoid what our hearts have to offer. As we  bring even 10% of who we really are to engage in our work, we will see dramatic  results.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  How do we, as coaches and  coach-like leaders invite or encourage authenticity in organizations? What is  the impact of our modeling with every client or team? How do we design our  alliance in each of our relationships in the organization&mdash;and redesign it as it  evolves? </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  How are we authentic in our own  lives? It seems to me that we choose  to be authentic. Sometimes that choice is in the moment, while interacting with  someone. We practice noticing when we are straying from authenticity&mdash;covering  up or faking something&mdash;and choose again. We also create an intention to be  authentic and make choices in advance that support that intention, such as  getting enough sleep and protecting ourselves from stress or other situations  that would impair our ability to be authentic. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  I believe it helps to spend  time with authentic people who remind us of how authenticity feels. People such  as: Henry Kimsey-House (listen to Henry talk about curiosity), Pema Chodren  (listen to her talking of awakening compassion) or Rachel Naomi Remen (read her  My Grandfather&rsquo;s Blessings). And  notice who you are when you are being authentic. 
	  A few weeks ago, I participated  in a Conversation Caf&eacute; (see <a href="http://www.conversationcafe.org/" title="http://www.conversationcafe.org/">www.conversationcafe.org</a>) for 90  minutes with some strangers in our town. At the end, someone asked, &ldquo;What is  this relationship we have created? It feels so much deeper than friendship, almost  like love.&rdquo; I believe that level of intimacy was possible because we were authentic.  What is possible as we create and maintain relationships at this level in all  aspects of our lives, even in our organizations?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  How are you being authentic  today? </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">How are you not, and what can you learn from that?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  What comes up for you as you reflect  on authenticity?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  Who else could you learn from  to enhance your authenticity?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  What symbol or word helps you  remember to be authentic?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  What stories do you have to  share?</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  The May 16 Coaching in  Organizations call has Carol Costello, author of The Soul of Selling, who will offer some marketing tools to help us  stay true to our authenticity. We  hope you will join our discussions on this call or others to expand on this and  other areas relating to our work.</p>
