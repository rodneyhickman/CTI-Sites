	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0705/geo07-w.jpg" width="90" height="125" align="right">Just imagine, a world in which Co-Activity abounds. Now imagine the Middle East, where people who speak Hebrew and people who speak Arabic have learned a common language called Co-Activity. I have good news for you: people in Israel are making this dream a reality, one small step at a time. Co-Activity is growing very rapidly in Israel, and as the song goes, “We’ve only just begun!” </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It seems like only yesterday that I attended an information evening promoting the first CTI course in Israel. I clearly remember CTI leader Juhree Zimmerman giving a 15-minute demo coaching session via telephone from her office in Vancouver to someone sitting next to me in Tel Aviv and thinking how easy and magical it seemed. I was immediately turned on to Co-Active coaching, and the flame has been growing ever since. I was in that first course in January 2003, along with Abi Shilon, my friend and founder/co-director of CTI-Israel.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  When the first course in Israel was almost the last one, Abi approached me and said in his quiet, modest and understated manner, “We must continue to expand Co-Activity in Israel. I want to make it happen.”</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  I agreed to assist him however I could from the sideline. Abi Shilon’s vision, passion and commitment to expand Co-Activity in Israel were the seeds for CTI and Co-Activity’s continued growth in Israel. Since we started, we have received so much encouragement from each and every CTI leader who came to Israel to teach us the Co-Active way. They shared our passion for this work to continue. Thank you to all of you CTI leaders, past and future, who are a part of the CTI-Israel journey. You have touched us all deeply. A special thanks to Juhree Zimmerman, who so much believed in us and our vision and “held the space” for us in the early days.</p>

	  It has been a challenging road, with many hurdles to jump. The first hurdle was that four years ago, not many Israelis had even heard about coaching. There were a few coaches in Israel and an inactive ICF chapter. In only four years, coaching in Israel has taken off in a big way, and the Co-Active approach enabled CTI graduates to lead the way in deepening a foundation of professionalism for coaching in Israel. Today, CTI graduates hold key positions in an active ICF-Israel chapter and work to promote professionalism and Co-Activity among all coaches. CTI-Israel co-director Yossi Eilot was instrumental in this effort. Today, there are approximately two dozen local coaching schools and a greater awareness about the profession in businesses, schools and not-for-profit organizations. CTI-Israel is the leader for those who want to learn coaching and be part of an international community.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  Let’s put something into perspective here. Israel is a country the size of the state of New Jersey, with a population of about seven million citizens. That’s about how many people are in a few mid-sized U.S. cities! Our national language is Hebrew. So the fact there are more than 300 members in the CTI-Israel community is something of which we are quite proud. More than half of the community has completed the entire series of courses and 16 coaches have completed or are in the process of completing certification. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  The profile of people who attend CTI courses in Israel is generally people with a first degree, many with master degrees. We represent a wide cross-section of professions: doctors, lawyers, psychologists, teachers, consultants, mediators, nurses, hi-tech engineers, administrators, academics and more. Many members of our community take the Co-Active tools back into their workplace and have an impact on their company culture. For example, the VP of Human Resources for a major cellular phone company in Israel and a CTI graduate, brought a group of coaches into the company for a pilot project. The pilot was a success and the project continued.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Many CTI coaches in Israel have started private practices in coaching and are developing niche communities in Israel. One outstanding example is a person who had become deaf and decided, through being coached, to have a state-of-the-art implant surgery that would enable him to hear again. Not only can he hear, he is now coached over the phone and coaches others over the phone. He is now a CTI-trained coach and is developing a niche to coach deaf people. WOW!  </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
	  To address local needs, the book Co-Active Coaching was translated by Anat Treister Goren, a member of the CTI-Israel community. The CTI-Israel community continues to hold a vision of offering courses in Hebrew. There is progress in this area. Dori Ben-Chanoch, a CTI leader, recently returned home to Israel with his family after living in California for many years. Abi Shilon and Anat (Nati) Treister Goren recently became CTI leaders.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> 
	  A total of 12 Israelis have participated in CTI’s Leadership Program to date. It’s a long way from Tel Aviv to California, and the distance does not stop us. We have a vision. We want to expand Co-Activity in Israel in a big way. A few examples of this from our Leadership projects include:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li>Sponsor       two peace activists to attend Leadership, one Jewish Israeli and one Arab       Israeli. Boaz and R are currently in Leadership. </li>
	  <li>Bring Co-Activity       to the Israeli army.</li>
	  <li>Honor       of Israel&rsquo;s 60th birthday in 2008 with a women&rsquo;s retreat       representing the cultural mosaic of Israel.</li>
	  </ul>
	
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In addition to Leadership projects, several exciting volunteer projects are underway that were generated from our community. This includes projects to coach students at risk and people traumatized by war or acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have monthly community meetings that are, of course, Co-Actively led. This is a great way for our growing community to remain intact, for people to meet each other, and to practice skills and find people with similar niche interests. We occasionally have visitors from outside Israel join our community meetings. So…how about planning a trip to Israel and come visit us. We would love to welcome you and, of course, we speak the same Co-Active language. We look forward to when thousands of people in Israel and throughout the Middle East speak, think and breathe the Co-Active way.</p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Feel free to contact me if you would like more information about our community or even about Israel. In Hebrew, there is one word that says so much: “Shalom,” which means hello, goodbye and peace. </p>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">SHALOM!</p>
