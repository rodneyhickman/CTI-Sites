	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Well, we hit the 4,000-members mark a couple of weeks ago, and we're still growing!  This is attributed to the passion and vision that each of you have and especially the organizers of our communities. Hear thunderous applause, whistles and great cheer! Communities in the works are Emotional Intelligence Niche and Chicago Metro Geographic Community plus the various Private Course communities coming on board.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our newsletter this month brings us articles from our newly re-charged Portland, OR, Geographic Community and our BodyMindSpirit Niche. Our member musing comes to us from the founder of the Coaching Studio Niche, Carol Ross, reminding us of the magic of "Co" in Co-Activity. Of course, we have the famous Judith Cohen with her insights from our member's inquiries. They  always seem to be what is needed in the moment to bring us back on track, wherever we are.

How do you care for self and what brings you back to your centered and grounded place? The top vote was visiting nature (one of my favorites) and in second place is having a good conversation. Being a community of coaches, I can see how this one received so many votes. Stay tuned for more polls for both information gathering and also for fun!

There are many great coaching books out there, but they have to be taken on trust. Not being validated, they lack credibility in some quarters. That's why I'm tremendously excited about the PhD in coaching I'm doing with Oxford-Brookes University. We all know the power of coaching, and one way of promoting its worth is through providing compelling evidence. This PhD is only one little step but it honours my values of life-long learning and getting coaching out there in the world with enhanced legitimacy.

I wrote an article for the Co-Active newsletter in January about my "Coaching Salon" and within 30 minutes of the email hitting inboxes, I heard from one of Shirley's supporters. The sender asked, "How willing are you to change the name of your venue, as it could easily be a source of confusion?" and then went on to suggest possible alternative names.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hello My Technological Troopers,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Promotional Services</b><br>I think it's important to talk about <b>promos</b> on the Co-Active Network. Firstly, the Co-Active Network was created for the sake of its members to come together both live and virtually to create learning, share resources, cultivate alliances, develop opportunities and build community. I've underlined the fourth item as a reminder to everyone that promos have a place on the Co-Active Network.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I don't want to have the impact of having created a spam-filled site and personally don't think we have in my perspective. I want the members of this community to be able to responsibly "sell their wares" and do it under the Promos thread found on the Main Community until the evolution of the site brings us another option. This thread is reserved for services in exchange for fees. If your service is complimentary, then please feel free to create your own subject and thread around that. You may want to frame it as such so that it is clear for the receiver.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Perhaps this is a good opportunity to create another thread topic for those providing and seeking "coaching services." Anything to create clarity in the public discussions area on the Main Community is helpful. The list is two pages long. I wonder what other "buckets" we could create? I'd say we're quite resourceful and creative wouldn't you?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Friendly Reminders</b><br>Going on vacation? Leaving the office for an offsite meeting? Please remember to go to Manage Account and select "No Mail" while you have your auto reply engaged. I've been getting better at keeping up with these for those who forget. Create a structure for yourself. I'm happy to help you help your account.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Daily digests and real time emails getting overwhelming? Go to Manage Account and uncheck all the boxes next the communities you wish to stop emails from then save your changes. You can then go into the site and check at your leisure. Most recently active threads can be found at the top of the list.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Can't find that bridge line for the call coming up? Go to the community sponsoring the event and contact the organizers if the leader information is not posted. You can find them using the link "About this Community." Click on their names and their contact information will appear. Sometimes the call-in number is listed within the event description.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>Dear Judith:
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/images/judith-pic.jpg" width="99" height="115" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">I have a client who has developed a crush on me. While I have made it clear to him that I don't want to be involved with him sexually, I do feel a pull toward friendship. We have occasionally seen each other socially during the time that I have been coaching him. However, it's becoming increasingly harder to coach him as his crush is deepening rather than lessening. I'm not sure what to do. What do you suggest?<br>JR</i>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear JR:<br>While it is great to be wanted, as a professional coach it's essential that you put your client's best interests first. This means that it's important for you to establish clear and professional boundaries with your client. Even if you did feel a mutual attraction to your client, as a professional coach you are not at liberty to act upon those desires. The first step is to clearly articulate your professional stand.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Second, I would talk with your client about the difference between his fantasy about you and what is true in real life. Assuming that you have been authentic and genuine with your client, he does have some true sense of who you are. However, that is very different than having a day-to-day relationship with you. Get curious about your client's fantasy while reinforcing the fact that this is a fantasy and not something that you are going to act upon. What qualities about his fantasy are most appealing to your client? What is your client yearning for? What is it about you that fuels his fantasy? Have him look to see what you represent and support him to find what he is looking for with an appropriate partner.
