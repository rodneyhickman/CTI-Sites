	Greetings Friends,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’m enjoying easing into my summer months, and I’m sure there are some of you who are easing into your winter. Isn’t the earth a wonderful thing? I believe that coaching is in some way supporting the sustainability of our wonderful celestial home. How can it not?  As we learn and grow and transform ourselves and our clients, we have a ripple effect that occurs and leaves a lasting positive impact. What a wonderful world.

by Joanne McLean, PCC, CPCC
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0607/niche2.jpg" alt="Joanne McLean" width="107" height="128" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">If becoming a real great woman leader were a good news/bad news story, it would go something like this: There are no short cuts. And the good news is, there are no short cuts! At some point in your life, you have to do the inner work—walk the path, know the sadness, the vulnerability, the separation and the messiness. And what I now know is that this path leads to an extraordinary story of possibility for women leaders.
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Why is this? Because women have so many innate, natural gifts for leadership. It is our ability to be inclusive, to generously listen, to see the long-term view while holding the current reality and our natural affinity to creating community. Women in leadership need huge support and encouragement to harness and deliver on their natural gifts. Unfortunately, in our business world today, women are still finding it challenging to really lead from their natural gifts.

by Ute Kueffner, CPCC, ACC, and Hannes Entz von Zerssen,  CPCC, PCC
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0607/geo.jpg" alt="Ute Kueffner, CPCC, ACC, and Hannes Entz von Zerssen, CPCC, PCC" width="217" height="115" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">It is from the place of fulfillment that we write this note to you all. It is June and the soccer world cup is taking place in Germany. The German team has played well and will move on to the next round. Juergen Klinsmann, the German coach, has brought on a good team spirit and changed the way of interacting with the players. It appears that he was able to install a sort of Future Self with the team. They have created a vision of themselves as a team. With this in mind it is almost secondary to win the game. It appears to be a win to play as well as possible in the moment. This permission is seemingly pulling them together as a team, and what is more surprising is that it is inspiring the whole country. We have never seen our country caught up in such a positive, inspired and fulfilled state since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. Fulfillment is happening in Germany.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Why are we writing all this right now? We are sitting in the first Fulfillment course ever held in Germany. It seems apt to write about the fulfillment of a dream we have had for some years. It was about bringing Co-Active Coaching to Germany. It was about bringing light to a place that had almost forgotten that life can be fun and exciting.

This is a tip I give to CTI course students when they  ask me how to be the best Co-Active coach possible. &ldquo;Do the thing or things  that you know will make your toenails shudder.&rdquo;</p>
	  <p>Why? Do I want you to raise your blood pressure to dangerous  levels? No. Do I think that terror is a useful strategy with which to coach  people? No. Do I think you coach better when you are trembling? No, no, a  thousand times no!</p>
	  <p>Here&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s a great tip. Co-Active coaching  works best when coaches are fully alive themselves and believe that anything is  possible for their clients. Now, I don&rsquo;t know many people who would argue with  what I just wrote. But doing this is easier said than done.</p>

    <p>Dear J.N.: <br>
My first response is to ask you a question. What do you want  to do? Common sense would have you tell your client that he is in no condition  to be coached if he is intoxicated. Let him call you back when he is sober.  Trust your instincts. They are most likely correct.
