	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Welcome to the inaugural edition of the <i>Co-Active Network News</i>! As I begin to write this introduction, I find myself filled with awe and gratitude: awe at the fact that we are already more than 2,000 members strong and gratitude for all of the people who have made it possible. Allow me to start with the awe.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">My amazement comes from witnessing what you all are doing in the Co-Active Network to bring the promise of Co-Activity to our world. Upon completing CTI's core curriculum two years ago, I had a vision. I imagined a world in which each and every human interaction, whether occurring in a personal or vocational setting, would become infused with Co-Activity. In my mind's eye, I saw the transformation of entire professions&mdash;Co-Active teachers, Co-Active lawyers, Co-Active executives, Co-Active healthcare providers, Co-Active

  	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0">realtors (to name a few)&mdash;all operating from a curious and intuitive state of being in which people are seen as naturally creative, resourceful and whole. I envisioned parents working vigorously to discover their children's hopes, dreams and aspirations, while simultaneously learning to self-manage their loving instincts to impose their own goals and agendas on their children. I dreamed of entire governments and social systems working together in elegantly designed alliances in which policy would be set based on what the "Level 3" called for, and not "Level 1" self-interest. In short, I saw Co-Activity as a way in which all humankind could live at its best. Now, fast-forward two years later. Here we are, more than 2,000 kindred spirits, each with a desire to bring Co-Activity to a specific area in which we are passionate. WOW!
  	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Which brings me to the gratitude. The Co-Active Network of which you are now a member was more than eight months in the making. We wouldn't be where we are today without the vision and dedication of our niche and geographic community leaders and their organizing teams. They are the catalysts that have ignited the Network. In particular, I feel compelled to recognize our earliest Co-Active Network pioneers: Debra Bruce, David Cockrell, Anne Devine, Marcia Dorfman, Carol Leavitt, Linda Lea, Fernando Lopez, Joanne McLean, Susan Moss, Alexis Phillips, Andrea Sigetich and Mary Witwer. Committed, patient, innovative and inspirational only begin to describe what you have been over the past year. Thank you for your contributions!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I must also here acknowledge my CTI colleagues Shirzad Chamine and Andrew Gabel. Shirzad, thank you for your unwavering support and vision for what the Co-Active Network can be. Andrew, my wonderful Wizard of Support, you are all things Co-Active and the heart of CTI. As a final acknowledgment, I ask you all to join with me in thanking Sue Boettcher and her entire team from Web Crossing, Inc., for developing such an incredible website. Sue, you are pure magic!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In closing, I want to call upon each and every one of you to join in and make the Co-Active Network your own. Dance in the moment with your fellow members by participating in the on-line discussions and attending the many events offered. Help broaden the reach of the Network by using the "Invite a Friend to Join" feature. Participate in expanding the number of communities available in the Network by contacting <a class="orange" href="mailto:networkinfo@thecoaches.com">networkinfo@thecoaches.com</a>. Bottom line: YOU are the Co-Active Network. By your playing full out, the Co-Active Network can serve your success and fulfillment, while simultaneously catalyzing positive changes in the world.

Their coaching company, Start Now Coaching, has had more than 300 inspired students go through the various CTI training courses! 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">From their drive, energy and commitment, our current Network was born in 2001! Ann Elin and Jerone saw the importance of building community around this growing profession, specifically creating an arena for coaches to stay in touch after their CTI training.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Since then, there have been so many dedicated people involved in helping our Network evolve. Too many people to mention here, but we salute all of you!

I'm the man behind the green curtain, The Wizard of Support! I'm here to make your Network experience as smooth as possible. Each month I'll be bringing you this column with musings and helpful tips on how to navigate the Network with fun and ease.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I must preface this month's column by first showering the wonderful and fabulous Debra Bruce (Lawyers niche) with gratitude for composing most all of the following text to her community a short while ago. This message is timely and is in service to everyone. Thanks Debra!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"We" understand that some of you could benefit from knowing how to manage the avalanche of emails you are receiving from the Co-Active Network listservs. You can regulate the flow by using the Manage Account feature. Here's how:
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Getting to "Manage Account"</b><br>Go to the Co-Active Network website at <a class="orange" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com" target="blank">www.coactivenetwork.com</a>. You will probably see your name at the top of the green column of boxes on the margin. (If not, you may need to log in.) The last line of that first box (the Welcome box) says "Manage Account." Click on "Manage Account."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Choosing "no mail" for all listservs</b><br>You will be taken to a page where you can choose "No Mail" if you do not want to receive any email at all from any of the Co-Active Network listservs (including this one). <b>This would be good to use while you are on vacation so that the listserv won't get an auto-responder out-of-office message from you every time someone posts.</b> (Quite annoying, especially if your message says you are vacationing in Tuscany or Hawaii or something.) It cannot be used for just some listservs and not others.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Choosing "no mail" for some, but not all, listservs</b><br>For the listservs you want mail from, click on the "Real-Time" or "Daily Digest" box opposite that listserv to put a check in the box.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For the listservs you don't want mail from, don't put a check in any box opposite the name of that listserv. If there is already a check in a box, you can remove the check by clicking on it.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Real-time vs. daily digest</b><br>For the Main List and each community you are a member of, you can elect to receive messages posted in real time, or you can get one daily digest that contains all the messages from that day in one long message or even both. For example, Debra chooses to get a daily digest for the Main List because it has a high volume of messages. However, she receives real-time messages from this Lawyers niche listserv because the volume is low and the discussion is more closely targeted to her interests.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Whole message vs. link</b><br>For the listservs that you choose to get real-time messages from, you can choose to get the whole message, or just a notification that there are new messages and a link to get to them on the website.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Help feature</b><br>If you are still confused, you can go to the Manage Account page and click on "Quick Help" near the top right corner of the page. There, you will find answers to frequently asked questions.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Save changes</b><br>Don't forget to activate your changes by clicking the "Save Changes" button at either the top or bottom of the Manage Account page.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Thank you for taking the time to review these features. We want to sharpen our communications in this highly communicative environment. Now go in and manage your account!
