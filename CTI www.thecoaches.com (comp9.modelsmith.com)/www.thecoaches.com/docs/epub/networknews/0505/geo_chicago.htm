	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0505/ben.gif" width="90" height="133" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt=""> <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> As a co-leader in the brand new Chicago Metro Co-Active Community, I got an invitation to send in a piece of writing for the <em>Co-Active Network News</em>. My first reaction was, “Why, sure.” Followed immediately by, “What the heck do I have to write about?”  which led to the even deeper, “What do I have to write about that others would be interested in.?”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Does anyone else recognize the gremlin? I’m sure it’s a common one of which we all have our own variation.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Well a couple of days passed and I still kept this article idea noodling around in my head. Obviously I wasn’t completely buying the discouraging argument and felt that I must have something to offer. “After all,” I thought, “I’m a certified coach. I have a semi-full practice, I’m teaching my own course that I created, and I ALWAYS have something to talk about.”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Pop quiz: Is this more the Future Self or the Gremlin talking?

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> For those who answered Future Self, I might add that at no time did I feel fulfilled in making this claim. It was more like I “should” be able to write something and send it. And forget all those who would not care to read it. Their loss.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> If you stuck with the gremlin, you’re pretty good at this. Heaven knows he’s doing a great job sticking with me. Yeah, I was still stuck and still operating out of self-imposed obligation that I couldn’t either complete or let go. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> It’s usually a cycle with me, considering most of my client calls are Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so by Sunday and Monday I feel dried up, uninspired and generally just going through the motions. All it takes is one conversation with a client and I’m reawakened. Things start to flow. I discover many of the flirts and inspirations the universe is providing right in front of me. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> This time, it was my own client, talking about how he was starting to learn a new habit of exercising—one that was becoming a part of his “molecular structure” rather than a “mind game” and compared it to learning to drive a car. “It takes lots of practice, starting and stopping, and the car’s jolting around.”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> “So how did you finally learn to drive?” I asked.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> “Well, I would pull into an empty parking lot to eliminate all the distractions so I could give laser focus to what I was doing. I could then give complete attention to how I was working the clutch and the gas pedal and not have to worry about all the traffic around me.”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Brilliant, I remarked to myself.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> “And I’ve noticed that I’m practicing the guitar again as well, just taking a little time out to focus, reminding myself that I’m not trying to create a performance, but just practicing the same riff until it’s second nature.”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Instantly I had to do my own focusing to remain with my client and stay out of my own Level 1. I realized that he had just described in basic terms Unconscious Competency, in a way that he knew—not just of its definition or even a personal example of what it looks like for him, but he now knows clearly how to do it himself.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Thinking back on it after the call, I knew I had the content for my first Co-Active Community letter. “How to achieve Unconscious Competence.” Well, I wasn’t sure what that had to do with Chicago, but I figured to just go with it and I would find what I really wanted to write about. 

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> In the process, I let go of having to come up with something brilliant, having to have a “message” and simply allowed myself to pull into my own “parking lot”—away from all the distractions—and focus on my “clutch,” which was simply expressing my own thoughts and discoveries.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Pop quiz: Future self or gremlin this time?

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> So now you may be wondering, “Yeah, that’s great and all, but what’s the point?”

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Simply this:  
 <blockquote>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">• When we stop pushing is when we can start to move. <br>
 •  Also, there is such marvelous information out there for us to tap into when we get out of  our heads and listen to our bodies, so be on the lookout. (By the way, out of curiosity, I picked up a coaching book and opened to a random page. The heading was, and I kid you not: “Never decide. Rather, let your body choose for you.”) <br>
 •  And finally, there is wisdom everywhere and from everyone. Even when we don’t think we have something to say. And that is my invitation to you as members of this community. To share what you know, what you think, what you feel, what you believe.
      Most likely not only can it open doors for you in the process (as this letter has for me), but it can be a source for someone else to discover what they’ve been looking for. So please accept our invitation to be a part of this community. Share, inspire, co-create this group with us. </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> We are all (for the most part) located around the city of Chicago, known as “the Windy City.” It’s a misconception that it is a comment on the weather, because Boston is actually much windier than we are, as are several other cities. Actually it’s a political slam. Apparently, the politicians were known for blowing a lot of wind, and hence the nickname stuck.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Now this might seem like an insult, but as we coaches know, there is always some truth to everything; it just depends on which perspective you choose. So I choose the “1963 Bob Dylan” perspective: “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind. The answer is blowin’ in the wind.”
