    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This month's <em>Co-Active Network News</em> brings us an article from the Relationship Coaching Community letting us know that relationship coaching has a far wider scope than what comes to mind when we first hear about it. Not only is it about couples, but also about business teams, co-leaders, families, schools, communities and even our own multiple selves. Fernando Lopez, CPCC, tells us how his relationship coaching journey has taken him across all these different settings.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’ll also hear from Ben Dooley, CPCC, of the Chicago Metro Co-Active Coaching geographic community.</td>

Ever since I started thinking of myself as a relationship coach, my conversations about coaching have produced a lot more tangible results. It has been a journey that I couldn’t have imagined, and it has led me to the discovery of widely different coaching settings, all tied together by relationship.     
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It all started about a year and a half ago when I felt called to work with business partnerships. I was working with two small business co-founders and we were doing great work together. For me, it combined the creative aspect of business with the juice of relationship, and it seemed like there couldn&rsquo;t be a better niche. So I went ahead and created a web site aimed exclusively at business partnerships and directed all my attention to this market. I felt I finally was doing things &ldquo;right&rdquo;&mdash;I had chosen a niche! Not only that, it was a business-related niche so presumably there was money to be made.	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?293@782.kXGZabypg1B.24@.3c40efbd" target="_blank" class="orange">Read the full article here.</a>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Hello Network’ing Friends,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’ve been keeping track of certain issues as they’ve been arising this past month. I thought I’d share some insights and recommendations this month.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em> “Calendar Events often seem to be full by the time I get to them to reserve a place.”    
    </em>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I’ve heard this enough times to give you some pointers. Please do not wait to receive this newsletter to find out what events are scheduled. Most of the events listed here have been on the communities’ calendars for a few weeks and maybe longer. The list of events here on the <em>Network News</em> is primarily used as a reminder and also a big-picture view of what is going on where and when. I suggest you peruse the Main Community’s calendar more frequently to secure your place in the various events. I personally link these events from each community to the Main calendar as I get a notification that one has been created. Events that are fee-based are not placed on the Main Calendar and can be found in the originating community. Look around and sign yourselves up!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>“I hear a dog in the background, can somebody put him outside?”
</em>    
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Boy, oh boy, is that frustrating! Often times, we simply don’t know the impact of what’s happening around us and its effect on a group bridge call. Just recently, we heard a couple conversing about a concert they attended during Henry’s call on Co-Active Leadership. Star (*) 6 will personally mute most phones. Not all. I assumed this individual perhaps thought they were muted. Ta da! My request (no, not a request because there can be no counter-offer), what I need, is that all participants on group bridge calls be hyper-vigilant to background noise during the call. Please do not call from a busy office, please do not wash your dishes, please do not call from your cell phone driving, and please, enjoy your meal either before or after the call (that chewing sound is icky.) I request (really a request now) that you take the perspective that you’re sitting in a classroom quietly and respectfully to what is being shared and taught. I know this is everyone’s intention after all. We simply forget sometimes. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>“I’m trying to update my profile and forgot my password, can you help?”
	  </em>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I must always start with the question, “Which profile?” You see, there are currently two areas within CTI in which profiles are found. One is the Find-a-Coach profile for CPCCs, located at <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com" target="_blank">www.thecoaches.com</a>, and the other is the Co-Active Network members’ profile on the Network at <a class=orange href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com" target="_blank">www.coactivenetwork.com</a>. Why two you ask? Well, we’re getting close to having it all in one place. We will be using the Co-Active Network’s profile for both our CPCCs and our general members. The CPCCs will be in a category of their own for those individuals coming to CTI looking for a Co-Active Certified Coach. SO, in preparation for this, all you CPCC’ers out there, get your profiles on the Network fully completed. That goes for everyone really. Two last things, remember that Network members who have taken coursework with CTI have the capacity for the extended profile within the site as well, and GET THOSE PHOTOS IN YOUR PROFILES! Contact me for help: <a class=orange href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a>.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>        L.D. </em>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear L.D.:
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It sounds like you have a lot of things collapsed into the meaning of being a coach. Let’s separate out what coaching is and what it isn’t. Underneath all of your insecurity and worry, I hear a deep yearning to serve your clients well and to master your craft of coaching. Thank you for bringing such desires to the profession. We need people like you. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Professionalism is an important aspect of coaching. Integrity is also part of being a professional coach. However, integrity doesn’t mean never making a mistake. What it does mean is that you acknowledge your mistakes and that you learn from them. The Co-Active model includes Deepening the Learning/Forwarding the Action. What can you learn from your work with this client? What will you do differently next time?
