<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="/networknews/0506/images/Geo-Mark.jpg" align="right">On May 1, 2004, 50-some fellow leaders, all members of the Co-Active Leaders Link (CALL), were sitting within the shadow of Chimney Rock at The Ghost Ranch, outside of Abiquiu, New Mexico. It was the penultimate day of our annual conference. The CALL <a href="www.thecall.biz" target="_blank" class="orange">(www.thecall.biz)</a> is a confederation of the nearly 1,000 alumni of the CTI Co-Active Leadership Program, AND it is so much more than that! On May 1, 2004, it became sledge-hammer clear to me how much more than an alumni association we are.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Suddenly the room was alive in the <em>chaorder</em> that comes from a vibrant use of Open Space Technology. Co-creative powerhouses moving from conversation to conversation, caught up in the fervor of creating something bigger than ourselves and simultaneously witnessing ourselves being called forth in contribution to that greater good—Making It Real!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The CALL is about calling human consciousness forth to its power, impact and responsibility. In that amazing open space in Abiquiu, an idea that grabbed me (and many others) was of creating a local chapter of leaders willing to engage in this calling forth. From that moment, sprang Minnesota & Friends, a gathering of CALL leaders from Minnesota and surrounding states and provinces. Any time two or more of us can come together, we ARE the contribution we want to be! We come together as Minnesota & Friends every other month, and various alliances of us are working together on an ongoing basis. We are a community intent on stoking and enhancing, at a local level, the leadership skills we gained through the CTI Co-Active Leadership program. Then we keep amping it up!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here’s the June 2004 invitation that launched our community: 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Hello all: 

</em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>So glad you are going to come to Lino Lakes and co-create our local chapter of the Co-Active Leader Link with us. Lynda Austin and I (Mark Lindblad) are happy to lead this first meeting, and together we'll design what happens from there. Cool!

</em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Here are a few particles—

</em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Please feel free to show up any time after 5 pm. We will be eating around 6 pm—that gives time for those driving a distance to allow for the traffic uncertainty. A walk in the woods or complete decadence on the deck are not out of the question, so come casual and comfy, if you dare. </em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>We'll be gathering at Mark's house (directions provided).

</em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Mark and Lynda will be preparing soup for us. You're to create around that.

</em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Our vision for this first evening is inspired by the story of creating a yummy soup—Stone Soup to be exact. </em>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">Story of Stone Soup

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">Once upon a time, somewhere in post-war Eastern Europe, there was a great 
famine in which people jealously hoarded whatever food they could find, 
hiding it even from their friends and neighbors. One day a wandering soldier 
came into a village and began asking questions as if he planned to stay for 
the night.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "Better keep 
moving on."

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making 
some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from 
his wagon, filled it with water, and built a fire under it. Then, with great 
ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a velvet bag and dropped it 
into the water.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come to the 
square or watched from their windows. As the soldier sniffed the "broth" and 
licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their skepticism.

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">"Ahh," the soldier said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone 
soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage—that's hard to beat."

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a cabbage he'd retrieved from 
its hiding place, and added it to the pot. "Capital!" cried the soldier. 
"You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as 
well, and it was fit for a king."

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 20">The village butcher managed to find some salt beef…and so it went, 
through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was 
indeed a delicious meal for all. The villagers offered the soldier a great 
deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell and traveled on 
the next day. The moral is that by working together, with everyone 
contributing what they can, a greater good is achieved.


<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><em>Lynda and I have provided the magic stone (our leadership, a meeting venue 
and gobs of soup), and we're requesting you to bring complementary goodies 
(bread, salad, dessert, veggies, beverages, etc.)—whatever calls to you to 
create a greater good. AND we ask that you do so as co-active leaders, i.e., you either prepare or present your offering to the gathering in co-activity with another person attending, letting us know what of YOU went into this contribution. Your contribution reflects your leadership. This is easy. Flex your imaginations. Have fun with it! </em>
<hr><p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We had a great time together that night in June 2004 and continue to get together every other month since then. That coming-together is a huge benefit of having a local geographic community. It’s a way of exhorting our personal and collective leadership in our world(s). 
 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Next horizon: figuring out a way to share stone soup to the CALL nation, regardless of geographic particulars, via<a href="www.thecall.biz%20" target="_blank" class="orange"> www.thecall.biz </a>and eventually <a href="www.coactivenetwork.com" target="_blank" class="orange">www.coactivenetwork.com</a><span class="orange">.</span> :) 
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Wishing you the good stone soup cheer that comes from creating community AND the power that comes from purposely activating together! 

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Lead on!

<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Mark Lindblad, CPCC, Minnesota & Friends Chapter Host and Current CALL Co-President</td>
