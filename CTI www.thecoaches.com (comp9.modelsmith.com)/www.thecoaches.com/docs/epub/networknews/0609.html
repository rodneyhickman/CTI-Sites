	Hello Co-Active Network Enthusiasts,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s “Back to School” with the arrival of September. People begin new arcs in their lives this time of year, whether it’s enrolling in school, taking that continuing education class or starting a new project at work. We get very busy this time of year at CTI, as new students decide to start their coaching education. September is a marker for many. What does it symbolize for you? I believe it rivals New Year’s Day in terms of new beginnings. Is there a new beginning for you?
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We have some new beginnings on the Co-Active Network. New community organizers are putting on their leader hat and leading the way in their communities. We have new organizers in the Spirituality and Coaching

<ol>
  <li><b> Back to basics.</b> Take your Future Self out for lunch and visualize the kind of business, the clients and the income you want. Volumes of information exist about how to take yourself (or, hey, hire a coach)  through the discovery of creating your ideal business. If you don’t know where you are going, any road will take you there. </li>
  <li><b>Be clear about your fees and value.</b> Determining fees, especially in a market where “average rates” are so widespread, is not only a practical exercise (e.g., hourly rate, retainer, packages, annual salary), but also requires the use of intuition as well. Read some of the great books on the market describing different pricing scenarios. Good questions to ask yourself for this process include: What do I know now about the market? How do I know it? What are the real costs? Will it work for me, for the client? The possibilities: What else can I come up with? What other interesting ideas are there? What is a new way to do this? What is my hunch about these fees and my value? For more, listen to last month’s call on pricing at: <b>405-244-4000, box 606.</b></li>

Seems like I’ve been noticing this my entire life.
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">From where I sit, this “bad rap” is a global phenomenon, not just a weird Western idiosyncrasy. It’s a phenomenon that drives who we are in boardrooms, in bedrooms, around the dinner table and in places of worship all over the world. Having worked extensively with my own emotions and with clients internationally, I see a consistent theme: an unconscious belief system that says: “Too much emotion is a bad thing…moderation or non-emotion is better.” No matter the culture, the underlying message is, “Rein in your emotions or suffer dire consequences.” 
    </blockquote>	  
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What slays me about this oversimplified LIE is that it applies to all emotions, not just a few. Don’t have or show too much anger…too much optimism…too much grief…too much joy, hatred, hope, despair, trust. Bottom line: DON’T FEEL TOO MUCH!

      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">More and more women are longing to access their authentic, grounded core, to reclaim their feminine essence in a powerful way. This is a doorway into where spacious (masculine) and creative (feminine) forces naturally co-exist. In this one-hour teleclass, we will begin to explore the qualities of the core masculine and feminine energies and differentiate them from the mask behaviors that are commonly identified as gender-specific qualities. We will also discuss the possible paths to tapping into these energies. Join Debra Wilton Kinney and Grace Menzel as they explore this rich and exciting work of uncovering a deeper connection to our true selves in service of greater connection in the world.
