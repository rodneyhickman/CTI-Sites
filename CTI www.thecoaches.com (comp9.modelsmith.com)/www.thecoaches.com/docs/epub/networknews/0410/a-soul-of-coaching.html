	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/kellog.jpg" width="90" height="120" border="0" align="right" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5">In each of us there is something that knows we are here for a reason, that we have gifts to give, and that the world is inviting us to dance. We can trust and delight in the surprises that fill the space created by our giving. We in the <b>Social Action and Coaching</b> niche community invite you to ask yourself these questions: 
				<ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
                <li>What if everyone who wanted a coach could have one?
				<li>What if coaching became commonplace in ALL cultures?
				<li>What if feeling depleted comes from holding back what you want to give to the world?
				<li>What if you can make a difference far beyond your work with individual clients?
				<li>What if giving is the most direct route to abundance and success as a coach?
				<li>What if you claim your ability to shape the world to match your ideals and dreams?
				</ul>	
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This is our playground in the <b>Social Action and Coaching</b> niche community.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We hold a big vision for coaches and coaching.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We believe that giving forward is the most powerful way to reconnect you to the passion that brought you to the profession. It is easy to feel powerless even as a coach, and the <b>Social Action and Coaching</b> community believes that your power is hidden in what you have to give. We want to challenge you to fill yourself up by giving your gifts away.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Fear not! We are not proposing that you give it all away and become a penniless coach. Of course, some social action coaching is well-paid! And, there still will always be a need for reduced-fee or pro-bono coaching. Consider having a percentage of your practice be for reduced-fee or pro-bono clients or choosing a non-profit or a cause you believe in and offering services for a year. Start a coaching program that fills a need in your community or the world. Give time, money, services or ideas.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As an example, one of our members, Ariane Cherbuliez, has been offering coaching to people doing political action work (voter registration, fair elections, direct action) in support of her political candidate. Ariane says, "I don't have to have decided the difference I want to make for the rest of my life, just what I am passionate about right now.  Being this clear about what I care about has let me be bold. Now I work with people who affect thousands of voters." Ariane's work in this arena is time-limited, focused and makes a palpable difference in her world. What can you do that will make a difference in your world?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This niche community is organized by Ann Betz, Virginia Kellogg, Lynne Gilliland-Garber, Tammy Gooler-Loeb and Roy Friedman, and energized by its 96 members! Join the Social Action and Coaching community (<a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/sa-np" target="blank">www.coactivenetwork.com/sa-np</a>) and play with us in the projects we are creating. We are in the planning stages and want your help.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We will be launching the Coaches Alliance for Social Action (CASA) in October. Help in the planning process for CASA by joining a call in October. <a class="orange" href="www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@159.BE2oaKJAbaW.6@.3c409f82!popup=1&nosubs=1" target="blank">October 7</a> and/or <a class="orange" href="www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@67.AHtaayHnbBQ.3@.3c409f83!popup=1&nosubs=1" target="blank">October 21</a>
	<p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>CASA will:</b>
				<ol style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
                    <li>Create a monthly project focus to offer coaching services. We will start in October with the AmeriCoach program. (See below for details.) Future areas of focus may be Women and Girls, Environment, Political Action, Young People, etc.
                    <li>Create a database of coaches ready to work with social activists and non-profits, giving direct service to those in need, as well as working with groups that provide direct services. (Join the database of coaches by sending an e-mail to <a class="orange" href="mailto:Virginia@LTWorks.com">Virginia@LTWorks.com</a>. Include your contact information, experience as a coach and how you might like to give.)
                    <li>Create networks of coaches already doing work in these areas for communication and collaboration. For example, we propose to link up all coaches working with young people, or all coaches who work with homeless people, etc. (Send an email to <a class="orange" href="mailto:Virginia@LTWorks.com">Virginia@LTWorks.com</a> if you are already working in an area of social action. Include your contact information, experience as a coach and the area in which you already work.)
                    <li>Work with coaching schools and professional organizations on issues of diversity and to give more credit for pro-bono social action coaching.
					</ol>	
	<p style="margin: 30 0 0 0"><b>Or, give your time to our featured program in October: AmeriCoach!</b>
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/logo-americoach.gif" width="220" height="88" border="0" alt="" align="right" hspace="10">AmeriCoach is a non-profit organization that provides individual coaching, coaching skills training and leadership development to AmeriCorps volunteers and staff. AmeriCorps is a national service program, often described as the "domestic Peace Corps." These volunteers spend a year serving in homeless shelters, schools, parks and non-profit organizations.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">AmeriCorps is seeking pro-bono coaches&mdash;certified or currently in certification&mdash;to work with these volunteers and staff over a nine-month period (beginning October/November). Most of the clients are in their early- to mid-twenties, and all are committed to using their lives to make a difference in the world. Coaches often say, "My AmeriCorps volunteer is my very favorite client!" (For coaches in certification, CTI and the ICF allow 15 hours of pro-bono coaching to count towards your certification hours.)
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For more information and/or to sign up to be an AmeriCoach coach, please contact Ursula Pottinga at <a class="orange" href="mailto:upottinga@mchsi.com">upottinga@mchsi.com</a>.
	<p style="margin: 30 0 0 0">The Social Action and Coaching niche community is the place to bring your restlessness with the way things have always been. It is not enough anymore (nor was it ever) to help things get "bigger" or "better" using the old paradigm. As one of our members put it, "Without altering the beingness, there can be no real healing." We have the opportunity to step into creating the world we dream of while holding the world creative, resourceful and whole.
