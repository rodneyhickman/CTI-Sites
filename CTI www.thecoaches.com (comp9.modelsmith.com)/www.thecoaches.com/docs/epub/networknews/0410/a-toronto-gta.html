	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/toronto.jpg" width="215" height="159" border="0" align="right" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="5">In November 2002, CTI celebrated its tenth anniversary. In order to spread the magic of celebration and connect to CTI's students in a heartfelt, authentic way, Henry Kimsey-House did a celebration tour of several cities in which CTI held its workshops. Many of us, who had already taken some CTI workshops, were excited and went to hear Henry speak. Inspired by his passion, we connected to the deep fire within ourselves. We spoke of building a community here in Toronto, a place in which we could share the magic, the mystery and the co-active model we had each absorbed through our training. Many of us, having completed our core courses, were searching for a way to come together, regularly, to begin sharing our ideas and dreams for the future. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Toronto, at the time, did not have a local community of its own. A handful of us decided to meet in "Quotes" a nearby bar and grill, to begin to see what was possible by creating one. We saw that we were planting seeds that would take time to spread roots, grow and flourish.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here we are now, two years later, in the autumn of 2004. We are delighted to say that the seeds we planted and so gently nurtured have blossomed into an exciting and expanding community of some 70 members! Our group is truly fortunate to be co-lead by Kristine Canniff and Jennifer Morgan. We hold our meetings monthly at Metro Hall. We are organized and led by a dedicated group of community builders (Samy Chong, Colin Holbrow, Elsbeth Tate, James Voulakos, myself and growing!) who are living their values, and who inspire and call forth all those who attend to contribute to our community in whatever capacity they feel called to do so.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our theme for this year is "Your Purpose, Your Passion and Your Niche." We feel that if we can inspire our fellow coaches to discover their true purpose and create their niche from the passion that drives them, then they will be empowered to change the world! We design our meetings to reawaken in each one of us our own passionate fire, together with the sense of possibility, we felt in the workshops! Do you remember that energy in you, when your leaders took you to those rich, deep places? That is where we challenge you to play! All of us want to re-ignite those powerful experiences. In order to foster that, our gatherings include: a spiritual element, such as a reading; a practical skill-building topic (led by one of our members); time to network and share resources; and some time devoted to breaking out into groups, to work in coaching dyads and triads. We feel strongly that such a combination will draw people in, help them feel safe to share, inspire them to grow. We hope that they will leave a meeting feeling enriched, nourished, excited and connected more deeply to themselves and to their larger community.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A few of our members have graciously offered to share their thoughts, as well. Here is what they have to say:
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"As a coach who lives geographically off centre, I am not able to go to all of the community meetings. When I do get to one, I am renewed and rejuvenated. Coaching is an awesome calling and seems to give me its own energy, but meeting with other coaches in the CTI community setting always kicks me to a new level. Thanks for that."<br>&mdash;Vicki Pinkerton
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"Being new to the field, the opportunity to connect with the Toronto area group has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop myself both professionally and personally. The diverse talents of other coaches have so enriched my life through the deep, meaningful conversations that we have partaken in together. I live in a small town 90 minutes outside Toronto, and it is well worth the drive!"<br>&mdash;Kenn Norman
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"The monthly Toronto Co-Active Community meetings are providing me with a courageous space that is supporting my personal needs. The meetings are also giving me an opportunity to touch base with coaches that share the passion to co-actively support people reaching for their stars. As one of the meeting organizers, I am delighted with the very positive feedback we have been receiving."<br>&mdash;Colin Holbrow
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/morgan.jpg" width="80" height="110" border="0" align="right" alt="" hspace="20">"Originally, becoming more active in the CTI Toronto GTA Community was a way for me to contribute to the coaching community and a way to stay connected with the world of coaching at a time when I didn't have an on-going practice. It has become a way for me to continue to grow and learn as a coach and as a person, in an atmosphere reminiscent of that which we experienced in the CTI core courses.  Our community is a source of nourishment for me, and I look forward to the connection and learning I know will happen at every meeting."<br>&mdash;Jennifer Morgan
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">"After leading the Toronto Co-Active Community for over a year and then moving with my family out of Toronto, I decided to let go of many responsibilities. The community was one of the last ones I checked in<img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0410/canniff.jpg" width="80" height="99" hspace="20" border="0" align="right" alt="" vspace="10"> with and my thought was that it was time to pass the leadership on to others. I put out a call for help, and several committed souls responded with a "Yes! We will help." Thus the "Community Builders" were born. Well…as you can imagine, once I revelled in this incredible new energy (and then crawled back asking, "Can I come back again, pleeeease?"), I felt compelled to stay and wow, what a journey it has been! One of learning how to ask for help, how to delegate, and yes, even discovering how to let go; one of awe at the co-activity we generate with our meetings and encounters; and one of deep connections that last a lifetime. What I would like everyone to get is that the potential in a coaching community is infinite...make it yours."<br>&mdash;Kristine Canniff
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">And as for myself, being a part of this community has taught me so much. I am delighted that our seeds have blossomed into this magnificent group. I hope and intend to continue giving in whatever ways will best serve our community. Like Kristine, I too, am struck by the intensity of the friendships we have co-created in this space. I am happy to be part of the experience as it boldly unfolds in the days ahead. I am learning a great deal here. Thanks to each of the people in our community. I will endeavour to serve in whatever way I can.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Co-Active Network is an exciting new way for all of us to take co-activity to the next level. We foresee each of these local communities interconnecting to each other more in the very near future. The Toronto GTA Community is a dedicated group of co-active coaches whose mission is helping to bring co-activity out into the wider world!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Co-actively yours,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Theo Barootes,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On behalf of,<br>The Toronto GTA Community
