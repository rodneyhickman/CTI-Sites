Hello Friends,
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While growing up, March meant it was time to get the kites out. Or it was an opportunity to get a new one from the drugstore. It was the windy month. It was time to fly! What a glorious sensation it was to imagine being at the end of the string way up high in the sky looking down. What a new and amazing perspective it was, whether I was on top of the hill or down by the water’s edge on San Francisco Bay or choreographing my kite string through the telephone wires by the railroad tracks.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Kite flying is a wonderful metaphor for how we see and experience our sensational clients and colleagues. What a gift it is to fly with them in the currents of life, the dips and turns, the relaxed tensions and the mighty winds of change. There is beauty in all of it.

A nice, powerful question! We are quite serious—what impact do you want to have in the world?
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We (Christine and William), as co-leaders of the Healthcare niche, want healthcare coaches to have a huge impact as coaches: from working with healthcare workers to changing national (and international) policies regarding healthcare; from working with healthcare executives to front line staff; from creating short-term programs to transforming cultures. We want coaching to be an integral part of all of healthcare—hospitals, patients, families affected by illness or injury, regulating bodies and government. The time is here for healthcare coaching. As the Healthcare niche organizers, we are ready to support you to make it happen.

Which is understandable, because the categories that are usually filled are things like “Best Actor” or “Best Screenplay” or “Best Technical Achievement.” What’s missing are the categories like “Best Heart,” “Best Inspirational Message” and “Most Spiritually Connecting.”

</b><br>
by Sandra Cain, CPCC    
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0703/sandra.jpg" width="97" height="124" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">My passion envy began on October 19, 1991. I was 22 and went  to a bar to see a band and met a guy named Kevin. He was also there to see the  band and, in fact, he even played guitar. But this was no casual guitar player;  he had been playing for years and was incredibly passionate about it. Being  female and 22, of course, I was instantly thrilled with the fact that he was a  musician. I was also struck by his passion for something, <b>anything</b> really. It made me ask myself questions like, &ldquo;What am<i> <b>I</b></i> passionate about? How would I know? Am I passionate about Pringles and Depeche  Mode? Does that count?&rdquo; Thus began my passion envy.
	  <p>The word &ldquo;passion&rdquo; conjures up feelings of dedication, fire,  drive, intensity and great love. I couldn&rsquo;t honestly say I felt that way about  anything, except possibly Kevin. We all know about<i> that</i> kind of passion. But what about passion for something you  believe in, something you want for the world, something that has you so  compelled to action that you really feel it&rsquo;s not even a choice anymore?</p>

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I guess whether there is a computer at the other end or not doesn’t really matter. There is all kinds of technology. Let’s look at some helpful information for what is the technology of the Co-Active Network. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Discussion Reply Information</b><br>

I’ve recently seen a post to “Trim Your Tails, email tails that is,” and I thank you Matthew for that one. I must add some additional information here. Digests will show up if you reply using your email reply feature instead of the features provided within the post. Do not reply to digests. Be inside the particular discussion and use the “Reply to sender” or the “Reply to all” blue links at the bottom of the post. This will prevent that unwanted tail every time.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>New Homework Help Folder in Main Community Discussions
        </b><br>
        I’ve decided to create a container for the many requests we see come across the discussion threads for help with homework. Historically, this has been one of those exceptions that allowed members to request coaching assistance. Because of the volume, I thought it was time. Be sure to use this thread like the PROMOs thread for anything related to asking for help with any homework coaching from CTI’s workshops.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Auto Replies / Out of the Office</b><br>
As we continually grow, I’m certain there are many of you unaware of a handy tool inside “Manage Account” that prevents emails bouncing to all the communities you belong to stating you’re away. 
      <p>Please create a structure for those of you who use auto  responders in your work life to remember to set your account to &ldquo;No Mail&rdquo; while  you&rsquo;re away. Simply go to &ldquo;Manage Account&rdquo; and select the box &ldquo;No Mail&rdquo; and  SAVE your changes. Upon return to the office, have that structure there again  to remind to you reset your account to once again receive emails from the communities  you belong to.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Of course, I&rsquo;m happy to receive any questions at <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a>.

      Welcome to the world of Co-Active Coaching! Your question is  not too simple. In fact, it is the perfect example of a powerful question.
