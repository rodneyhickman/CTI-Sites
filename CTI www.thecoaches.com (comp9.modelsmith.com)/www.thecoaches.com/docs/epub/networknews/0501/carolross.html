	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0501/carol.jpg" width="82" height="109" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">I have been playing with a forum I created, The Coaching Salon, over the last six months. Turns out it's not a new name. Someone under the auspices of Coachville has been using that name for several years, with a similar bent on helping others learn about coaching through a shared experience of observing live coaching. Even the act of watching someone else demonstrate a discipline is not new. Think cooking shows, home remodeling shows and black belt demonstrations at the local karate studio. What is new is the way in which The Coaching Salon transforms the participants as well as the observers. Here's how it works:
			<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 30">
			<li>A volunteer from the audience is coached for 12 minutes by a professional coach&mdash;someone who is trained as a coach.
			<li>There is at least one other person observing the coaching and preferably more, including other professional coaches.
			<li>Feedback follows each coaching. The volunteer client gives the first feedback and then the audience is invited to provide feedback.
			<li>This cycle of coaching with feedback is repeated twice, each time with a different volunteer and different coach.</li>
			</ul>
   	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Sometimes, it's not clear what you have on your hands until someone else tries out your idea. A friend tried out The Coaching Salon in another part of the country. She did it with another coaching colleague. In the process of accommodating her colleague, this friend played and stretched the form of The Coaching Salon&mdash;from 12 to 15 minutes, coaching one-on-one instead of in front of others, guaranteeing confidentiality where it could not be guaranteed. And of course without observers, there could be no feedback. I'm fortunate to have this friend. She taught me what was important about The Coaching Salon, those parts that are non-negotiable, by inadvertently omitting the parts that give the Salon its uniqueness.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">She emailed me a report on what happened at her Salon. The exchange between the two of us played out like the chiseling of a beautiful stone sculpture, with each email response bringing me closer to the essence and form of The Coaching Salon. Until finally, I wrote this in response to the question of what makes The Coaching Salon so good, so compelling, so appealing:
	<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 30">
	<li>I learn by watching other coaches, both what I want to do more of and what I don't want to do.
	<li>I get great feedback, instantaneously, from both the "consumer" perspective and the "knowledgeable colleague" perspective. It helps me improve. I love it when a colleague says where they might have used balance when I used fulfillment, or identifies a more powerful question I could have asked, or provides a missing clue on what was going on with the client.
	<li>It is a means for seeing "who will stand next to me." My wish for coaching is that every coach is visible to the public, doing her or his best at showing what coaching is. Some people's "best" is better than others. But the point for me is to be fully seen as a coach. Can some people's "best" be harmful to the image of coaching? That's a risk that I'm willing to take, to get the other 99% of coaches standing tall about coaching, willing to be vulnerable and to be a role model.
	<li>Salons expose people to coaching who otherwise would not sign up for a sample coaching session. It's a way to ease more people into the coaching world. I have had people decline a sample coaching session but who want to come to a Salon.
	<li>When other people besides the client are a part of a coaching session, not only are they seeing coaching up close, they are transformed in the process. We slow down to the conversation in front of us. People get engaged, listen intently and respectfully, and think more deeply. To witness coaching is to witness each other's humanity. As humans, we know what it is to be in relationship with one another&mdash;we just need the right space to "be human."</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I know that not everyone sees The Coaching Salon in the same way that I do. I've found that it brings out the fear in the best of coaches: Will I be good enough? What if other coaches come and are no good? Won't it hurt the image of coaching? 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I cut through the fear with the blade of trust, that steely resolve in each of us that proves our instincts right every time. I trust that when I am with a client, a stranger whom I have met for the first time, that I will be able to see something that I love about the client. It might be a spark or lighting up of the face that tells me what this client cares about or the vulnerability that comes with knowing that someone has seen your worst fear and understands it. When I sense the important parts of our connection&mdash;the bottom-line of the client's facial gestures, unspoken emotions and coded messages&mdash;then I know that I've coached well. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">While I'm giving the client value, I'm finding the power to stand tall in the cradle of my own gremlins. The shared experience that is unfolding between the coach, client and audience bonds me to my own strengths, highlighting what it is that brought me to coaching in the first place. I have had tears well up in my eyes at the sight of a colleague coaching brilliantly. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We don't give each other enough feedback on how brilliant we truly are as coaches. The Coaching Salon is a way for acknowledgments to be flying across the room, like Cupid's love arrows, each one destined for another coach. Self-love and self-hate walk a fine line. When a coach is participating in The Coaching Salon, it's impossible to come up with self-hate in the face of fellow coaches and grateful clients. Self-love conquers even the worst of our "not good enough" demons. I love to tell coaching colleagues, "You really are that good!"  I see it with my own eyes. I can't help but breathe it in like redolent air on an early spring day. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What I know to be true is that as coaches, we really are that good. Good enough to withstand the feedback that our own egos deny us. Good enough to show the public what coaching can do for the average Joe or Sally. Good enough to give our gifts as much as we can in service to the world.
