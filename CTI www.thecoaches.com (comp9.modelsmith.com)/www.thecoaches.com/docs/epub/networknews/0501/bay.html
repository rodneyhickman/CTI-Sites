	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/networknews/0501/bay.jpg" width="153" height="116" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" alt="">Aren't we lucky to be living in the Bay Area? Sun, fog, hot, cool and downright nippy all in one region. There are a few oddities here, as well. One of our bridges is "golden." We can claim not one, but FOUR, chapters of the International Coach Federation. And those chapters are in an area within one hour of each other (if there's no traffic and you catch the lights right). So many coaches, so many chapters, so little time to take it all in.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That's one reason I thought it would be a good idea for the Marin Coaches Alliance to collaborate with all the other chapters in the Bay Area and do an event that was mutually beneficial to all of us. We'd get a chance to "meet" on the phone during the planning process, get to know each other from the standpoint of what we each brought to share and then have the pleasure of meeting in person at the event. We'd be able to offer our chapter members a chance to show off their talents while working for a bigger goal. And, we might possibly make some money in the process! What could be wrong with that?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As it turns out, not much! A year ago, the East Bay Chapter, the Silicon Valley Chapter, the San Francisco Coaches and the Marin Coaches Alliances joined together to bring Julio Olalla here for a day-long event. Our goal was to offer a program that was slightly different, that would provide coaches with skills they could relate to and incorporate into their individual practices. From the feedback we got, I think we did all that AND got a chance to do some fine dancing as well! And we learned a lot along the way. Some of us have that overview thing going on and can hold the big picture like nobody's business. Others have the ability to see the tiniest particle that adds just the right finishing touch. For some of us, our coaching skills took off as we danced with site managers, caterers and Julio's staff. And, not to be left out, lots of us got to ham it up on the day of the event, welcoming everyone and being hosts. Oh yeah, other side of the coin: we got a chance to see what we weren't so good at AND how wonderful it was to know someone else was right there to pick up the slack. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So this year, we're going full tilt boogie! We manifested (after a LOT of pleading in our nicest voices) a day with David Whyte. On blind faith, the four chapters again agreed to join hands and forces to present a day of soulful poetry to everyone in our communities. With this event, we have the opportunity to let everyone know the power of self and some of the many ways to reach into ourselves for that. And what better way to do that than with a coach? We think it a marvelous venue for lots of people to be introduced to the magic of coaching. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Some of us are veterans from last year. Lots of us are thrilled to learn how much we can contribute and how much we are appreciated. For me, I love that I get to work with chapter members from all over the Bay Area. And when we finally do meet, I feel like I already know them, in such a wonderful way. We are a force to be reckoned with, this merger of chapters, this larger whole. Come see David Whyte on January 22, 2005, and experience the magic we have worked.
