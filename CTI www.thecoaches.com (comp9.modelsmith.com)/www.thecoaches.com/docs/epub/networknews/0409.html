	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Welcome to our second edition of the <i>Co-Active Network News</i>.  It's September and you know what that means…it's <i>back to school</i> time!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">To commemorate this annual rite of passage, it is only fitting to feature our Education Niche in this, the September edition of the <i>Co-Active Network News</i>.  My thanks to Dr. Linda Lea, co-leader of the Co-Active Network's Education Community, for contributing this month's lead article, <i>A Vision for Change: Teachers as Coaches Leading the Way</i>.  I can think of no other application of Co-Active Coaching and leadership that can have a greater positive impact on our world than that of education.

He ambled over to where I was, winked and said, "I just had to say hello to my favorite teacher."  The shocking realization of who he was came quickly as I struggled to maintain my composure and slip into my teacher mode.  He was one of my former students of over 20 years ago. The interaction that followed was delightful as he shared with me his success in both his professional and personal life. I realized that to him, I was still his teacher, and I couldn't help but reflect on the huge impact teachers have on their students' lives. I would like to think that who he is today is partly due to the contribution I made as his teacher a long time ago.

We have been pioneers in developing skills, sharing resources and supporting one another since October 1998, when our first dedicated CTI coaches, Terry Ramsey and Juhree Zimmerman, cooked up the idea to deepen our learning through monthly meetings.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We've had some significant milestones in the local coaching community.  When the 5th Annual ICF Conference was held here in October 2000, it was a strong contingent of CTI coaches who contributed to the successful planning of the event.  In November 2000, our local ICF chapter, with many CTI coaches at the helm, became the first ever to legally incorporate.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Looking at the recent past, I have been observing many of you seeking your places to belong and longing to connect with others on the Network through communities that do not yet exist.  I saw coaches in the Chicago land area wanting to get connected. I saw the impassioned GLBT folks longing to reach out to their community.  What other communities are longing to be created?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I thought this a great opportunity to have you look inside to see if there is a place you're longing to contribute to, whether it is to lead a community or simply to help form one by nudging that "perfect" person.

Please join renowned spiritual development and life coach Alan Seale as he explores this inquiry in a highly meaningful teleconference on the Co-Active Network. In a recent article in <i>Choice</i> magazine, Alan writes, "Profound coaches constantly hone their awareness skills to become masters at 'soul listening.'" During this session, Alan will guide us through an experience of "soul listening" and provide insights into how to further develop this aptitude. Alan Seale is founder of Full-Spectrum Living and author of the acclaimed new book, <i>Soul Mission * Life Vision</i>. His first book, <i>Intuitive Living: A Sacred Path</i>, received the COVR Visionary Award for Best Book in Spirituality in 2001.
