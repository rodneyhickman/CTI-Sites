Until recently, that was the usual response to questioning about professional coaching in Louisville. Louisville, you see, is a hotbed of college basketball—U of L, UK and IU. If you happen to be a basketball virgin and don’t recognize these legendary teams or their coaches (Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, Bobby Knight and Denny Crum), then perhaps you’ll recognize other sports names celebrated by our great city: Muhammad Ali, the Louisville Slugger, the Valhalla Golf Course, Louisville Extreme (skateboard) Park, and the ever popular, Kentucky Derby. Keeneland is “just down the road” in Lexington, and within a two-hour drive from Louisville are the Cincinnati Reds, the Cincinnati Bengals, the Indianapolis Colts, the Indiana Pacers and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

And they were not making a dent in what they referred to as  their &ldquo;lack of discipline.&rdquo; These same clients have often resisted when I've  suggested accountabilities or that we together set up some goals. As an  experienced coach, I've explained the benefits of regular appointments and  talking over what might have come up to deflect them from their goals, alas to  no avail. I'd love some guidance!</i><br>

    <p>Dear  S.B.:<br>
      As a  former client of just that type, I can relate to both of your predicaments. I  know in my own situation, I had a very powerful streak of perfectionism that  was dictating my behavior. Although I never deferred any of my sessions, I used  to dread showing up when I hadn&rsquo;t completed my homework assignment. It was hard  for me to imagine that my coach would still like me if I didn&rsquo;t complete things  on time.</p>

       <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Do you know where your clients are? Chances are a key referral source right in your neighborhood has them! Pat Barone, CPCC, PCC, of Catalyst Coaching LLC, will lead a discussion on "Developing Key Referral Sources" for the January community call. This is a repeat of our October call on which a bridgeline snafu meant that many interested coaches who had signed up for the call couldn't reach us. Learn how to find key referral sources, plus how to approach them and develop relationships that will lead more clients to your doorstep! Join us!

       <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Join Lucid Living founder and MCC, Leza Danly, for a provocative discussion about the power of emotions. During the 90-minute discussion, we will explore the role of emotions in creating the life you want. Conventional wisdom leads us to believe that creating the life of your dreams will produce emotions of happiness, joy and fulfillment. What if it's the other way around? What if the emotions of happiness, joy and fulfillment create the life of your dreams? A life-changing moment of liberation occurs when you stop chasing circumstances to try to be happy, and instead learn how to create happiness to attract different circumstances. Bridgeline information will be emailed a few days in advance of this special event.
