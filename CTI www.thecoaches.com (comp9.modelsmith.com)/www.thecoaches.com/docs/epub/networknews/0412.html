I am full of gratitude to you, our organizers and members who have made it what it is today. I can't help but be thrilled at all of the possibilities for us in the coming year. We will have more learning, more connection, more successes, more failures (YAY! Don't you just love the learning that comes from those lovely failures?) and more enhancements to the system! Yes, I've been listening. We have a great list of enhancements that we will be addressing step-by-step. I appreciate the feedback and requests you have provided. I invite you to keep your suggestions coming as we create all of this great community together.

He gets up, puts on his coat and hat and goes to his retirement party. After listening to trivial speeches, Schmidt ends up in the bar alone. Welcome to retirement!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Schmidt is depressed and feeling useless and discarded. He is not only disconnected from his colleagues, he does not know who he is, who his wife is or who his daughter is. He is alone in an emotional wasteland having been too busy working to really be present in much of his own life.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">After numerous inappropriate attempts to enjoy himself traveling in his RV, he returns home alone and opens a letter from World Vision, from a little boy in Africa. The child has sent a drawing of himself reaching up to hold the hand of a big man, namely Schmidt, who begins to cry as he realizes that this little stranger who lives miles across the ocean is the only person in the world to whom he is emotionally connected!

Less than two years ago, in January 2003, the first Fundamentals course took place in Israel. Less than two years later, December 2004, the first group of Co-Active coaches in Israel completes Synergy and moves toward certification. This is how things work in Israel. When something catches on, it grows like wildfire!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Co-Activity in Israel is on the move! About 90 people have completed  Fundamentals since the program began and many plan to continue toward certification. Many Co-Active coaches in Israel are seeking ways to integrate Co-Activity into their existing careers. Our diverse community comprises business leaders, educators, school administrators, public officials, doctors, dentists, lawyers, psychologists, organizational consultants and even a couple of sex counselors! Our community is also demographically diverse. We intend to soon have Arab Israelis participating in CTI courses in Israel. We are excited and optimistic about the impact this will have on our society.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">You are what you eat. Not a pleasant thought to anyone who has ever been sick, gone to the toilet or worked in the fast food industry, but true nonetheless. The vast majority of you comes from a whole collection of stuff you've lunched, crunched, eaten with chips, dips and sips of drink, then slurped, burped and digested throughout your astoundingly hungry life. The rest comes from stuff you've inhaled, inherited, been injected or infected with and soaked up through your skin. If there's anything left after that lot, it's probably best that you don't tell anyone where it came from.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">And, when you die, your molecules are going to be distributed back out through the environment to become parts of worms, beetles (probably not the Beatles, though), some roots, some shoots, some funky, gunky fungi and plenty of bacteria. And it may console you to think, once you're contemplating eternity from within it, that without you and your molecules, many of the plants and animals that follow after you wouldn't be having the time of their lives that they will be having, once you aren't.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">Similar things are going on even as you read. The various crevices of your spotlessly clean body are playing host to billions of bacteria, an occasional fungus, almost definitely a mite or two, and perhaps even the odd nematode or insect. All of whom are merrily going about their business, and possibly yours, causing little or no disruption to you unless you're unlucky, in which case you might want to see a doctor or, if your occupants are particularly numerous or large, a pest control contractor. In fact, with that small ecosystem going on about you all the time, it's a wonder you can sleep at night over the noise.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">There really is no escaping your link with nature: the very building blocks of your body are absolutely lifting with super-evolved bugs. Truly! The components of your cells that provide you with energy are the evolutionary result of a continued alliance between a fast-evolving cell and a bacterium with particularly loose morals. And rather handy they are too.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">So, we are made up of nature, we host nature, we become bits of nature, any new bits of nature we spawn along the way will also be made up of nature and all those other humans are part of the same deal. Are you spotting a trend here?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">You might, in a positive moment, reflect on the fact that these interactions between organisms take a long time to come about. All of which highlights the miracle that despite the worst ravages of mankind, there are some particularly forgiving bits of nature that still want to stick around with us. Admittedly, we might have to be dead before some of them take much of an active interest, but let's not split hairs; if they like us even when we're dead, we can't be all that bad, and wouldn't it be a shame not to return that affection and forgiveness?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 10 0">So, after you've finished reading this, do yourself and your cells a big favour: go and stand in a place of natural beauty, be still, and soak it up. Do nothing else, just that. Then reflect on what you will do to preserve it, after all, nature is still there being beautiful for you, so how about you return the favour?

Is she able to keep up with domestic chores, thank you notes, and playdates, and never miss a client appointment, return a phone call or an email?

	<p style="margin: 7 0 0 0">Dear Ones, the focus of the monthly vision for December is "the growing of the light." December is home to many meaningful celebrations that are all, in some way, centered around light. What is the light that you celebrate this season? What is the vision that lights your heart and your way, even when the road may appear dark? Maya Balle, who co-led the November call, will be joining me as co-leader of the monthly vision call beginning this month. With peace and light and love, Reggie Odom.
