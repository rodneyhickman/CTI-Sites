          </h1>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Welcome to the Spring 2010 edition of the CTI UK email newsletter.<br />
            <br />
            The ability of the Co-active Coaching model to create powerful conversations and equitable relationships, where each person gets to grow and shine, is borne out by the fact that the vast majority of our course participants come to us via the enthusiastic referral of our existing graduates. <br />
            <br />
            This is how CTI has grown over the last 15 years from a small business based in North California to a global company reaching across four continents. In the UK, this word-of-mouth effect has been no less powerful and, as a result, in February, we were delighted to present our introductory coach training course, The Fundamentals, in Manchester, for the first time. <br />
            <br />
            More than 25 people from UK's North West and Midland,  as well as from Europe, gathered together at the Lowry Centre, at Salford Quays, to enjoy 20 ICF-accredited hours of live, interactive coach training. Many congratulations to all who came, and we hope to see you on our Manchester intermediate coach training course, the Core Curriculum, soon. <br />
            <br />
            Any of our existing Fundamentals graduates will be interested to note that the Manchester Core Curriculum, which runs between 26 March and 11 July, is priced at just &pound;2,700 (+VAT), a saving of &pound;500. For more information, please email Judy Rich <a href="mailto:judy@thecoaches.com">judy@thecoaches.com</a> or phone +44 (0)845 299 8199.<br />
            <br />
            This month, we have replaced our 'Profile of a Successful Coach' feature, with a Q &amp; A interview with <strong>Art Shirk</strong> and <strong>Kyoko Seki</strong>, who will be leading our <strong>Co-active Leadership program</strong>, which begins in May 2010 in Spain. <br />
            <br />
            With more than 20 residential training days, spread  over 10 months, Co-active Leadership course participants dive into the heart of what it means to be fully expressed as a human being able to make a positive impact in the world. Existing coach graduates looking for their next step or all who want to transform their ability to lead others from the heart should read on.<br />
            <br />
            Elsewhere, in our Learning Point article, coach <strong>Dorothy Atcheson</strong> explores the 'designed alliance,' the dynamic container in which Co-active Coaching unfolds, while <strong>Margaret Ogilvie,</strong> CPCC, relates how we coaches can tame the limiting thoughts that hold us back.<br />
            <br />
            Wherever you are in your personal development or career as a coach, we hope to see you in one of our courses soon.<br />

		   Interview with Program Leaders Art Shirk and Kyoko Seki</h1>
		   <p  style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> 
		     
		     <strong><em>Many people have the idea that leadership is something that's dependent on certain personality traits, such as charisma, or the ability to clearly articulate a vision -- not unlike Barack Obama -- but what kind of leader does the Co-active Leadership program create?</em></strong> <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art Shirk:</strong> Well, part of Co-active Leadership does stem from personality traits, such as charisma or humour, etc. An important part of our philosophy is that all human beings have the capacity to express themselves in authentic and natural ways that are engaging and compelling. Unfortunately, as we go through life, that authentic and unique part of ourself often gets covered over or blocked by more superficial ways of being. In Co-active Leadership, our starting point is what we call &quot;Creating from Self,&quot; which entails digging down to access our most authentic expression of ourselves...getting out from under the limitations that block that authentic expression...and allowing the most authentic leader within to come forward. In many ways, this is like a prerequisite to Co-active Leadership from my point of view. It is the foundation that we build on. From there, the real experience of Co-active Leadership takes off. <br />
		     <br />
		     From that starting point, Co-active Leadership builds the capacity to connect deeply with others, and to lead from that inter-relatedness. Co-active Leaders are able to create intimacy, and to allow others to create intimacy with them. That might sound funny, because we don't usually use that word (intimacy) when describing Leadership. But, in truth, when we are in the presence of powerful leaders, we have the experience that they are connected to us deeply -- it is not superficial. <br />
		     <br />
		     Often we operate in life as though we are isolated and separate from the world around us -- other people, places, the environment. If we allow ourselves to access the parts of ourselves that are most wise, we discover that this is an illusion. And there is a paradox here: while we are unique individuals, we are also deeply connected -- ultimately to everything around us. In Co-active Leadership, we discover, explore and practice our capacity to build and lead from that connection.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko Seki:</strong> In the Co-active Leadership program, there is a fundamental belief that everybody is a leader, and has a unique and special gift to offer to the world.<br />
		     <br />
		     I used to want to change myself as a leader; to be more logical, more visionary, more charismatic, and…and…and. However, I discovered nine years ago, when I took the Co-active Leadership program, that creating an impact on the world around me was much more compelling and powerful when I embraced and fully expressed my own authentic self, which, by contrast to the things I thought I needed to be, was very intuitive. I let go of the idea that I needed to become someone else to be me, and it's been much easier and more fun since then.<br />
		     <br />
		     To evoke leadership within ourselves, we must stop pretending to be someone else and fully step into the expression of our authentic selves. This program supports every participant to discover his or her unique and authentic power, and to begin expressing it with full permission.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>The Co-active Leadership model talks about taking the lid off our passion. Tell us more about that and how it relates to being a leader in the world.</em></strong><br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko:</strong> Many of us have lived our lives for so long with a lid shut so tightly over our true identity, suppressed for so long, that we've forgotten how to access our passion inside. Some of us may have been busy pleasing others, working hard to be socially successful, being a good person for others, and so have forgotten to look deeply into finding what it is that we truly yearn for. The Co-active Leadership program supports participants in remembering their deepest desires, both for themselves and for the world. <br />
		     <br />
		     Personally, I believe that this information has been already embedded in our souls, and so the process is more like a journey to &quot;remember&quot; our sacred path. Once people remember their deepest desires and passion, they get grounded in his or her stance as leaders and become unstoppable in moving things forward to manifest the world they want to see, no matter what situations they confront. <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art:</strong> For me, this is about freedom in life...freedom to be our most authentic selves...freedom to reach out, to pursue our highest dreams...freedom to say no. We all have ways that we have learned throughout our life to shrink back, play small, stay comfortable, avoid rejection, avoid risk-taking. <br />
		     <br />
		     Over the years, we build automatic ways of responding to the world that are reactive rather than creative. We respond to situations from a place of fear or control rather than passion and creativity. The good news is that we know, even from a neurological perspective, that our patterns of responding to the world can shift over time, with practice. In Co-active Leadership, we work on becoming more and more adept at &quot;taking the lid off&quot; so that we are more able to express ourselves authentically, connect with others more freely, be accessible to others more genuinely, and take more courageous steps toward what our hearts most fervently desire.<br />
		     <br />
		     I strive to see each and every course participant as the most authentic, powerful, courageous, creative and magnificent leader that he or she truly is. Sometimes, though, we all show up differently...from our more &quot;lid on&quot; selves. To me in the Leadership Program, this is simply an opportunity to practice recovering  our higher selves. We are all human. There is huge compassion in the Leadership Program for all of the challenges that we go through in life, and the ways in which we may stumble. <br />
		     <br />
		     I want people to know that they should come to the program exactly as they are, and bring with them the very highest dreams they have for what is possible. <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>In what way can Co-active Leadership empower our ability to form powerful and equitable relationships with others? </em></strong><br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art:</strong> Wow, this is quite a question. Well, the truth is that my capacity to connect with others dramatically shifted when I did the program myself more than 10 years ago. It actually opened up a whole new world for me. I found that I was able to go into a whole array of new situations in my work as a consultant with a degree of confidence that I had never had before -- or, to step in front of a room in a workshop or board meeting or team meeting in a whole new way. At the heart of it was a new capacity to open myself to connect with others.<br />
		     <br />
		     I think there are various things that are &quot;at the heart&quot; of Co-active Leadership. This, for sure, is one of them. In my programs, I'm committed to each person discovering a radically new way of leading through their relationship with others. It is amazing what happens when this takes place. In the program, each person has the opportunity to create something in the world with another person. That experience changed my life, and today one of my closest business partners is the person  I  did that work with. I have seen people do extraordinary things that they never imagined they would possibly do through this capacity to form powerful relationships with others.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko:</strong> Often we think that we need to compromise ourselves to some extent to work with someone or persuade the other to do things our way. The Co-active Leadership encourages  participants to live in a paradox of 100% - 100%: two people showing up fully and allowing the other to do the same. When that happens, the true magic of co-creation occurs and the unique gift of that particular combination of people naturally emerges.<br />
		     <br />
		     During the course, the participants will practice giving and receiving 100% in working with their partners over and over. I have witnessed many times in the program that the participants recognized their edges in the relationship and went through a huge transformation in relating with to others. <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>When Co-active Leaders talk about reading the space, what do they mean by that and why is it important to leadership?</em></strong><br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art:</strong> That sounds so incredibly New Age, doesn't it? Yet over the past decade, there has been more and more written on this topic. At the top of the list would be the book authored by Peter Senge titled <em>Presence</em>. Through research in social intelligence (by Daniel Goleman, for example), we know that there is an energetic field that imbues the environment within and between people in a group. We feel this most directly in our one-on-one relationships. If you expand that awareness outward, you can notice that you become aware of the &quot;energetic feel&quot; of larger spaces. For example, when you walk into a room where there is underlying tension or disagreement, you can feel the discomfort in the room. <br />
		     <br />
		     Powerful Co-active Leaders use their capacity to sense this energetic field that exists between us. We all have the capacity to open ourselves to the space around us...to allow ourselves to be connected to it...to allow ourselves to be informed by it. <br />
		     <br />
		     For me, it is related to my deep sense of intuition about what is happening beneath the visible surface around me -- and even more than that, my ability to sense what wants to unfold. It is a bit like imagining a large boulder  poised at the top of the hill, just at that point where it will begin to roll down. There is an energy of potential in that boulder that is poised to begin rolling.. it is about to unfold. As Co-active Leaders, we build our capacity to use that intuitive sense for the sake of having the impact that we want to have. This is a rather sophisticated skill.<br />
		     <br />
		     For me, it is one of the most powerful aspects of our work. I must say that once you have built this capacity, you can never go back. You become aware of the world around you in a whole new way. <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko:</strong> One time, I was leading the workshop with my co-leader. While people were nodding and smiling, I felt  something heavy and even angry in the room. When I spoke my observation and asked what was happening, I learned that there was a conflict among participants. Rather than following our timeline, we changed our schedule entirely and used this conflict in service of creating real learning for the participants about themselves. It brought much deeper learning than the original plan.<br />
		     <br />
		     Space is an ally for leaders, since it gives us information on what is really happening and  helps us respond to the situation powerfully in the moment. <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>We live in a world with a low tolerance for when our leaders fail to live up to expectations. How does the Co-active Leadership program address this?</em></strong> <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko:</strong> One of the greatest gifts I received from the Co-active Leadership Program was not just the permission to fail but also the ability to be responsible for that failure. As human beings, it is impossible to be perfect, and we naturally fail from time to time, especially when we need to take a risk in creating an impact as leaders. In the Co-active Leadership program, people learn how they can be authentic enough to embrace their failures when they happen and, from that same place of power, be responsible for the impact they've had. <br />
		     <br />
		     One of the most amazing speeches I have ever seen in my life was made long ago by the president of a Japanese manufacturing company. He is a well-known successful business leader in Japan. Yet he was being accused by the employees that particular year; he had failed in his management decisions and, as a result, employees' salaries had been cut. After he had listened to every one of his employees who wished to speak, he started his speech. He admitted that he was responsible for the outcome, apologized sincerely, expressed his deepest appreciation to all his employees from his heart and then presented a plan to transform the situation for the future. His heart-felt expression of his responsibility about his failure was stunning. With applause by employees, trust was restored . This is unusual to witness in Japan where there is an extremely low tolerance for failure, especially in the company. His leadership ability to be responsible for his failure, rather than hiding it or trying to make an excuse for it, restored trust with his employees.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art:</strong> In true CTI fashion, we celebrate failure! If you think about systems in which there is low tolerance for failure -- organizations, communities, political arenas --  what happens? <br />
		     <br />
		     Over time, the operating principle becomes, &quot;If you take risks and fail you will be knocked down, so keep your head down.&quot; That is no way to lead, and true leadership does not come from that place. With that belief in place, people become risk-averse, cautious and work hard to keep the status quo. <br />
		     <br />
		     In our model, we believe that there must be a simultaneous focus on giving oneself &quot;full permission,&quot; meaning, mustering the courage and will to take bold action, combined with being &quot;responsible for impact.&quot; Being responsible for impact does not mean being cautious or shrinking back; it means staying aware of the impact that one is having in each moment, and gauging action depending on the results you are getting. There is another important concept here, which is &quot;stay.&quot; Leaders sometimes do swing out and fail or make mistakes, and they stay to respond to that impact, to correct course. <br />
		     <br />
		     I believe that authentic self-expression as a leader must include not only making mistakes, but creating spaces (teams, organizations, families, communities) in which others are able to express themselves and step into leadership, too. That is what it's all about. In my Leadership Program, participants quickly learn that there is room to swing WAY out...to take risks for the sake of their learning and growth.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>How have you been able to practically apply your learning from taking the Leadership Program, to make an impact in the world yourself?</em></strong> <br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Art:</strong> My leadership group was called the &quot;Arrows&quot; and it was about 10 years ago. As part of the program, I did a project with a woman named Sonia, who was from Colombia, South America. Now it is 10 years later, and Sonia and I are business partners running a Coaching and Leadership Development school in Bogotá, Colombia. We are beginning to do deep conflict resolution work with people in Colombia who have been victims or perpetrators of violence in the Colombian civil war that is still going on. Ten years ago, I could never have imagined that I would be doing this type of work. Sonia and I are examples of participants in the Leadership Program who really committed  to getting every bit of value we could from the program. We participated full out and have been allies ever since. Like many things, you get out of the program what you put into it. I can promise people with a very high degree of confidence that if they give themselves fully to the process, they can expect life-changing results.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko:</strong> I took the program in 2001 and I must say that I am still impacted by the program, and its impact is getting bigger and bigger even now. It was as if I received a lifetime inquiry from the program: &quot;Why are you here on this planet and what are you going to do now?&quot; My answers to this inquiry have continued to shift and become more refined, as I evolve as a human being. <br />
		     <br />
		     Through my journey, I came to know that I am here on this planet to evoke in human memory that one heart in harmony with the universe can light the world. My lifetime desire is to create  world peace in which people connect with each other beyond cultures and languages. But  I believe that must start from a place of internal peace within us, with the realization of our oneness with the universe and its power. I believe that world peace will never be manifested without individuals making an effort to obtain internal peace first. <br />
		     <br />
		     I have been holding peace circles in Japan to convey this message and support others to evoke their memoriesso that they can have internal peace with the realization of their oneness with the universe. The community is growing.<br />
		     <br />
		     <strong><em>As a leader of the Co-active Leadership Program, what would you say to someone who's uncertain about whether to take the program or not? </em></strong><br />
		     <br />
		     <strong>Kyoko: </strong>Listen to your deepest truth in your soul. You were born on this planet to offer your gift at this time. The world is waiting for you. The time is now.<br />
		     <br />
	         <strong>Art:</strong> This program is not for everyone all of the time. When people do not feel ready to commit themselves to a deep learning process, or do not believe they will be committed to doing the work, or are not experiencing a gut-level &quot;hunger&quot; for transformative growth in their lives, my guidance is that it may not be the right time. And there is nothing wrong with that! We all have periods of time in our lives when we are on the edge and hungry for growth -- when we have a sense that there is somewhere we want to get to, and we want a giant structure to help pull us forward -- and there are other times when we are not in a growth period. I find in my life that I have gone through cycles like this. I think that when people are ready for this, they know it deep down -- they have a sense of calling or yearning mixed with a bit of fear or excitement. For these people, I say, well, jump in. If not now, when? And, for others for whom it does not feel right, I say: wait until it feels like the time is right.</p>

      CO-ACTIVE COACHING LEARNING POINT <br />
      The Designed Alliance</span><span class="style12"><br />

            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Where else in life do we consciously and intentionally design our relationships? <br><br>


            With our partners, work colleagues and family members, we usually just kind of fall into the relationship. It's only later, when patterns or problems emerge, that we may try to address them -- if we bother to address them at all.<br><br>
            In Co-active Coaching, the idea of a designed alliance can sound mysterious and intriguing, and yet, essentially, it simply describes the relationship between the coach and the client. It isthe intentional, articulated and flexible contract between you that supports and empowers the client and enables the coaching to flourish. <br><br>
            In CTI training, we learn that it's the relationship that has the power in Co-active Coaching, not the coach. <br><br>
            Unlike other professions -- say a doctor or a lawyer -- the coach is not an expert that the client comes to for advice. Instead, both coach and client take responsibility for the relationship and give power to it by specifying at the outset -- and going forward -- what they want to achieve and exactly how they want to be and work together. <br><br>
            As a coach, the designed alliance reminds me that I don't have to have 'the answers.' I just have to show up, in the way my client and I have agreed, to support the relationship and use my coaching skills to help them toward their own eureka moments. <br><br>
            In the <em>Co</em>-<em>active Coaching</em> book, the designed alliance is the part of the model that 'surrounds the coach and the client and represents the container within which they do their work.' <br><br>
            It's literally the circle that wraps around the client's fulfilment, balance and process. <br />
              In that way, it's kind of a protective layer, a safe space.<br><br>
            For me, the key to creating a safe space is to encourage open and honest communication at all times, and to model this in my coaching. I ask clients to be candid about how they're feeling and what's coming up. I don't want them to humour me and go through the motions if I do or say something that doesn't work or pisses them off. It's only if they feel safe enough to tell me about it that we can then both get curious and look at what's really going on. This establishes the necessary trust to nurture and support our alliance. <br><br>
            Your alliances will be slightly or wildly different with all of your clients. That's the beauty of it. Just as Co-activity ensures there are no cookie-cutter coaches, there are no identikit clients either. As their lives change from the coaching, what they need from you and the relationship often changes, too. Which is why, in a way, you're constantly designing the alliance.<br><br>
            In one client's discovery forms, I learned that she had a tendency to put on a smooth veneer and act as if everything was okay when she was under pressure. <br><br>
            So I asked: 'How do you want me to be with you around that?' <br><br>
            She thought about it carefully and then asked me to challenge her if I thought that was going on and not take what she said at face value, to probe further. She essentially gave me permission to push her when she was uncomfortable -- something that may not have felt safe for her without our designed alliance.<br><br>
            Some clients are a bit hesitant with this question, as if they're not sure they're allowed to request for me to be a certain way. So I always probe a bit here. I tell them about my style -- that I tend to be direct, rigorously honest and sometimes challenging. Is this okay with them? How might I need to adjust for them, their personalities, their circumstances? <br><br>
            And then, in the course of your coaching, it's important to reflect on how it's going, to check in with each other about what's going well, what could be improved and how things might need to change to get the most out of the coaching. <br><br>
            If you're not a coach, why not take a look at some of your relationships and ask yourself -- and the other person: How do we want to be together in this relationship? What are my requests? Or: Where could we be more honest with each other? It's amazing what can happen even in ordinary relationships when you open up this sort of purposeful dialogue.<br><br>
            And, if you are a coach, check in with some of your clients again. Ask yourself -- and them: What's going well in our coaching right now? What's going less well? And: What do we need to change to get the most out of this coaching relationship? <br><br>
            As the <em>Co-active Coaching</em> book says, 'The strength of a client's ability to make changes is a measure of the strength in the coach-client relationship. And the strength of that relationship is measured by the commitment and open, fearless design of their alliance.'<br><br>
            So give yourself and your clients another chance at this, and as the relationship strengthens perceptively, so too will their ability to make real changes in their lives.<br><br>

    Taming Our Saboteur</span><span class="style12"><br />

      <tr><td width="620" height="367" align="left" valign="top" style="padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px;">
	         
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> Glimpsing our potential magnificence can be as scary for the coach as it is for the clients; how can we possibly acknowledge, step up to and claim what we are capable of? Can we let go of whatever is needed, are we willing to believe and internalise that we are this good? Can we take the unknown path?<br><br>
		  Asking powerful questions like this often results in fear because they can be challenged by what Co-active Coaching calls the saboteur. <br>
		  <br>
		  According to the <em>Co-active Coaching</em> manual, 'The saboteur is a concept that embodies a group of thought processes and feelings that maintains the status quo in our lives. Often operating as a structure that would seem to protect us, it in fact keeps us from moving forward and getting what we truly want in life.'<br />
              <br />
              For coaches seeking to fulfil their full potential, the saboteur can often result in thoughts such as: <em>other coaches, maybe but not me, or not yet; maybe I should settle for being fairly competent; best not to push yourself too far; maybe I'll never make it as a coach.</em><br>
              <br>
		  But how can we deal with such insidious voices? <br><br>
		  Indeed, it is important that we do deal with them, because there is a huge learning here around who we are being as a coach. The reason is that, like our minds, the saboteur will always be with us. It is neither good nor bad: it just is. The saboteur loses its power over us when we can identify it for what it is, notice our options in the situation and then consciously choose what it is we do really want at that time.<br>
		  <br>
		  Even just accepting that the saboteur will come and  chip away at our self-belief, naming it and recognising that its whole purpose is to be a constant saboteur, helps to wilt its power over us. Remembering that saboteurs only have the power we grant to them, allows us to relax into being who we are and recognising the good work we do. We are in control. <br>
		  <br>
		  Here are some questions that can help coaches, or anyone for that matter,  address their saboteur. And it's important that you do, because if you don't, left to its own devices, the saboteur can become like a rogue sailor boring a hole in the bottom of the ship. You won't know about him or her until water is rushing in and you are sinking.</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>What does my saboteur tell me? Who am I really?</strong> Clarity here will help you name and tame the saboteur. For example, if your saboteur says you aren't successful, relax into who you are and remember the good work you do and have done in your life. 
		        As a coach, it is important to remember who you were and what you did before we were a coach. As coaches, we can bring to coaching all that we have learned from the richness offered through our past experiences in life, whether from work or personal life. Do you have management and mentoring experience? Have you dealt with illness or weight problems? Can you bring money or business start-up expertise? What values do you live to? What really satisfies you? It doesn't matter what part of your life experience you draw your confidence and self-esteem from; there is no reason you can't bring that into your coaching practice.<br />
		        <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>How do I use my coaching skills, knowledge and intuition to enrich other areas of my life, such as training, group work or personal relationships?</strong> Clarity here deals with the saboteur that restricts what you can become by constraining coaching within a narrow box. <br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>Am I coaching to my values? Is it OK, for example, to choose to coach someone for very little money when I know 'regular' coaching fees would deny them coaching?</strong> Getting clear in this area, can help tame the money saboteur.<br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>What do I want from life and how does coaching fit within this?</strong> Family, travel, writing? Getting clear helps to tame the saboteur that can make you think your career as a coach is solely responsible for your fulfilment. <br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>How do I define success?</strong> Money (of course we need to live)? Satisfaction from a job well done? The joy that accompanies personal growth? What else?<br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>Are there things I need to do, things I've put off for lack of self-belief or expertise, such as good publicity that is worthy of what I offer, better marketing, regular e-mails and so on?</strong> You can find lots of information on all of these, if needed, once you really internalize that you can make the living you want by doing what you do well whilst still being yourself. <br />
		      <br />
		    
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>Am I able to ask for help in the areas in which I'm weak?</strong> Learning to ask for help in these areas, for example in marketing your business, can also help to tame the saboteur that wants you to believe that it will be a struggle to build a business as a coach.</li></ul>
			<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">
		        Once we have learned to tame the saboteur, from a place of relaxed control and being with whatever might come up, coaching can be the doorway to a hugely satisfying, very successful career, whatever we want that career to be.<br><br>
		    	From this place of relaxing with who we are, recognising our strengths, forgiving our failures (remembering that failure is not failure but the opportunity to learn and be brilliant), we can revel in being really good coaches and reap the rewards, however they come, with open arms. <br>
