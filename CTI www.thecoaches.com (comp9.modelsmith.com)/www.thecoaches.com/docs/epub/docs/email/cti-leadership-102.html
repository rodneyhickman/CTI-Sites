			<h1 style="font-weight: normal;">Always been curious about the CTI Leadership Program?</h1>			
			
			 	<p>Have you or someone you know ever considered participating in the Co-Active Leadership Program yet hesitated to enroll due to concerns about the time commitment or the financial cost? If so, CTI has come up with a way to experience what we mean by Co-Active leadership that addresses both of these issues: we will be offering the first retreat from the Co-Active Leadership Program series on a standalone basis in June 2012.</p>
			 	<p>Experience the first powerful leadership piece called “Creating from Self,” without committing to the full four retreat program. Bonus: CTI co-founders <strong>Karen and Henry Kimsey-House</strong> will personally lead this standalone Leadership retreat.</p>
			 	<p>Gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your path in your world or community. Break through self-perceived limits and gain confidence that comes from knowing yourself. Do this work in a community of like-minded peers who will hold you to your true magnificence even when you can’t see it yourself. Discover new ways to be in relationship in all areas of your life.</p>
			 	<p><strong>Dates:</strong> June 20-25, 2012<br>
			 	  <strong>Location:</strong> Westerbeke Ranch in Sonoma County, CA<br>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> $2995 USD</p>
			 	<p>If you have ever been interested in finding out what the Co-Active Leadership program is all about, this is your chance. If you are a Leadership Program graduate and know someone who might be interested, please forward this information. It’s important to sign up soon, there are only 20 spots left for this program and we expect them to fill quickly. </p>
			 	<p>No discount coupons may be applied to this special program, however, if you decide to continue on with the full program, discount coupons may be used. The amount paid for the standalone retreat will be credited toward full tuition.</p>

Karen and Henry are masterful facilitators and created a safe space for exploring and connecting with the group and myself. I’m approaching my relationships at work and in real life through a lens of energy-types (theirs and mine) and am better able to manage the challenges and stress of everyday life. It has been very powerful to find a supportive group of new friends.&#8221;</p>

Returning to my life and work after R1, I feel I have given myself permission to be myself. Being in relationships, coaching clients, and creating connection from here, I am more vibrant, compelling and alive!&#8221;</p>
