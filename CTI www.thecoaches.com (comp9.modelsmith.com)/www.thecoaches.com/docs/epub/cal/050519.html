	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CTI's pioneering innovations in coaching and leadership have resulted from a continual loop of piloting new cutting-edge ideas and learning from participants' reactions and feedback. This process enables CTI's founders to continue to innovate and pilot new ideas. As participants in these pilots, you get to experience the latest creations of these industry visionaries and play a role in shaping our industry's future.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Retreat 5: Leadership Mastery</b> is a new addition to the Leadership curriculum that we're piloting this year. The first pilot was held in March 2005 to great reviews. The second pilot will be offered July 12&ndash;17, 2005. If you're ready to take your leadership to a new level, come join us for this cutting-edge program.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>About the program:</b><br>Retreat 5 begins where Retreat 4 leaves off and moves your leadership forward by taking you to new heights of Level 4 leadership:  full permission and full responsibility for impact.  You will <i><b>learn a new technology</b></i> for more accurately reading and interacting with "Level 3" (no kidding!), with lots of opportunity for Level 4 leadership and feedback. Some of the skills you will hone during this retreat include deepening of <i><b>Full Permission</b></i> and taking <i><b>Responsibility for Impact</b></i>; big stretches in <i><b>Co-Leading</b></i>; an unforgettable experience of <i><b>Creating from Everything</b></i>; and you'll have lots of <i><b>FUN</b></i> (of course)!
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b>What participants are saying about the program:</b>
				<ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
                    <li>This retreat is for people who are clear that they want to take their leadership to the world.
                    <li>Lots of opportunity to practice Level 4 leadership and expand my range.
                    <li>I learned that my greatest failure as a leader has been not giving myself full permission to fail.
					<li>Retreats 1-4 prepared me for Level 4 leadership; Retreat 5 is all about Level 4 leadership.
					<li>I learned the huge importance of <i>recovering to my stake and staying</i>&mdash;even after I succeed.
					<li>I have a much better understanding of what it means to be a team member and how important it is for teams to have a leader&mdash;even in a team of leaders. To be a highly effective team, the leader needed to empower the team, and the team empowered the leader.
					<li>It was a great laboratory for building my leadership muscle.
					<li>Great practice with arcs, timing and marrying Level 3 awareness with my Level 1 urge.
