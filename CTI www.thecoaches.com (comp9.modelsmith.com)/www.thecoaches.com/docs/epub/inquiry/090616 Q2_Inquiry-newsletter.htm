        <p class="style13" style="margin-top: -2px;">Travel to these different places has been rich, experiencing different geographies and landscapes and sampling different culinary delights. As always the most rewarding thing has been meeting people everywhere who are curious, alive and longing to contribute themselves to their world in ways that matter.</p>
        
        <p class="style13">As I talked with people from these different cultures, I was struck by our shared humanity. Beneath the surface--in the place that is heart to heart--we are all longing for such similar things. I was struck by our differences, by our separateness, and by how that creates such occasion for stimulating dialog and exchange of ideas. And I was struck by the breathtaking uniqueness of every single person that I met.</p>

<p class="style13">In his book and tape series &quot;Canticles to the Cosmos&quot;, noted cosmologist Brian Swimme talks about the three foundational forces of the universe. These forces operate simultaneously in paradox and the dramatic tension between them holds everything in place and creates a container for the unfolding story of the universe to emerge.</p>     

<p class="style13">The first principle is communion: we are all one. Every speck of life in the universe is one with all the others. This oneness is not a hope or a wish. It simply exists. So, whether we like it or not, whether we “believe it or not”, we are all one.</p>  

<p class="style13">The second principle is differentiation: we are all separate. Every speck of life in the universe is separate and distinct from every other one.</p>

<p class="style13">The third principle is subjectivity: we are all unique. Every speck of life in the universe is unique and different and in it's aliveness, is striving to express that uniqueness. Not just &quot;a&quot; tree but this particular tree. Not just &quot;a&quot; human but this particular human called, for lack of a better word, &quot;Karen&quot;.</p>

<p class="style13">Just communion without differentiation and subjectivity and you have a meaningless and congealed lump.</p>

<p class="style13">Just subjectivity without the other two principles and every piece is floating about in its own sphere with no connection, interaction, and learning and development.</p>

<p class="style13">Just the first two without subjectivity and there is no diversity or interesting and complex variations on the theme.</p>

<p class="style13">So all three principles are essential and needed and each serves the whole in a way that is simple, profound and to my way of thinking quite magical.</p>

<p class="style13">Through my travels, I am reminded to celebrate and embrace all three of these principles. I may long for communion but recognize the necessity to include differentiation and relish subjectivity.</p>

<p class="style13">I may experience subjectivity and at the same time, hold the knowing of communion and differentiation.</p>

<p class="style13">I may savor the uniqueness of each person and without the inclusion of communion and subjectivity, that savoring holds less resonance.</p>

<p class="style13">The paradox of these three principles holds so much. The opportunity to stay connected in our differences and the gift of exploring uniqueness with connection. And so much more.</p>

<p class="style13">Holding these things together is a practice worth failing at. . . and I frequently do, with my tendency towards linear thinking and my increasing and still limited ability to hold simultaneous complexity.</p>

<p class="style13">This practice (and even the failing at it) brings me fully into the mystery and my gratitude for the unknown and unknowable. Thank you Brian Swimme.</p>

<p class="style13">Gratefully,<br />
Karen</p>

           </span><br />
           <span class="style28">As we transition from one season to the next, I thought this would be a great time to remind you how to change your email address and password on the </span><span class="style58"><a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #534B72;"><strong>Co-active Network</strong></a></span><span class="style28">.

Because everyone’s email accounts change from time to time, it's good to check that your login is up to date.</span></p>
          
           <strong><span class="style33 style53" style="text-transform: uppercase;">To change your email address:</span></strong>
           
           <ol class="style28" style="display: inline;">
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;"> Look at the top of the green box at the left edge of the screen. If it says &quot;Welcome [your name]&quot; you are logged in and ready to proceed.</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">If it says &quot;Welcome Guest&quot; you are NOT logged in to the Co-active Network. Use your current (soon to be old) email address and password to get in.</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;"> Once you are logged in, click the 'Update My Email Address' link a few rows below where it <br />
             says &quot;Welcome.&quot;</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">Swap out the new for the old email address in the marked field and click the 'Save Profile' button. (Note: this is a good time to review your profile and make sure that the info there is current.)</li>

             <br />

           <ol class="style28" style="display: inline;">
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">Verify that you are logged in as described above.</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">Click 'Manage Account' a few rows below where it says &quot;Welcome.&quot;</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">Just below the 'Manage Account' heading, you will see a box with your current email address followed by two links: 'Change Email' or 'Change Password'.</li>
           <li style=" margin-left: 18px;">Simply click 'Change Password' and follow the prompts.</li>

             <br />
             <span class="style28">There has been a change in the relationship between CTI and The School of Co-active Coaching which has been running CTI courses in the UK for over five years under a licensee agreement. This license agreement has expired and CTI operates directly in the UK as of May 1, 2009.</span>           </p>
           
           <p class="style28">We are very grateful to Martyn Lowesmith and Zoe Windsor for the integrity, heart and love with which they have held our work in the UK over the past five years. When Martyn and Zoe took over CTI UK, Co-active Coaching had a much smaller footprint in the UK. But it was their hard work and dedication that really made CTI UK soar and without them, we simply would not be where we are today.</p>
           
           <p class="style28">We have been doing quite a bit of careful planning to insure that this transition is seamless, resulting in no disruption to community relations or customer service. As we move forward, we hope to be inclusive of cultural differences without being dominated by them. We can be both local and global. In this way, we can work together to expand the sphere and influence of the Co-active Coaching Community in the UK for the highest good for all. We have much to learn from each other. </p>

This year, with the recent addition of a distance learning component, recommended reading, and an exam, CTI applied for and received increased ACE credit hours for the Co-active Leadership Program. As of May 2009, the Co-active Leadership Program qualifies for 6 semester hours--3 semester hours in Leadership and 3 semester hours in Organizational Behavior.</span></p>
           
           <p class="style26">
           <span class="style28">Employees should check with their employers to determine if ACE accredited semester hours qualify under applicable tuition reimbursement policies. Students should check with their college or university to verify that their educational institution honors ACE accredited semester hours. The ACE credit recommendation applies to all Co-active Leadership
Program courses run by CTI US regardless of the location the course is offered.</span></p>

           <span class="style28">Participants must specifically register prior to the start of their Leadership Program to take the course with the intention of earning the ACE semester hour credits. ACE students pay an additional fee above Leadership tuition, must attend all four retreats, complete the homework assignments and between retreat course projects, and pass the exam in order to earn the 6 ACE semester hour credits.</span></p>
