	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear Co-Active Coaches,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Welcome to the September issue of <i>The Inquiry</i>.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our topic this month is coaching as a catalyst for social change. The two questions posed in describing this topic were: "What is possible from the perspective of co-activity?" and "How has coaching changed your belief in your ability to have impact in the world?"  Jim Patterson, CPCC, MCC, speaks to the first of those questions as he writes about "What would it be to live in a co-active world?" in CTI News. Tarra Christoff addresses the second question in her article "How to Be a Co-Active Activist."

	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><b>What Would It Be to Live in a Co-Active World?</b><br>by Jim Patterson, CPCC, MCC
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">That's one heck of an inquiry, isn't it? By its very nature, the question throws me to a rather inspiring and awesome place of possibility. And right there with me are all the gremlins and circumstances that want to argue the possibility, stand in the way; all the dark and scary places of inadequacy and unknown and "not the way we have always done stuff." And, still, the inquiry has a life of its own and asks to be entertained. There is a sense of ease that comes with being "on purpose."
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CTI continues to give its full attention to developing the opportunities within North America, responding to the eagerness and interest from individuals and organizations for co-active coaching programs in all the communities in which we have been working for more than a decade. The material is vital and current, the leader body is stronger than ever, and the systems for supporting that work and those communities continue to grow and expand. Our role in the<img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0409/pic2.jpg" width="250" height="166" vspace="10" align="left" alt=""><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/images/spacer.gif" width="5" height="180" align="left" alt=""> development of the coaching profession is well regarded; our graduates are well respected and in demand. Life is good.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">For more than a few years, we also have been working with entrepreneurs in <a class="blue" href="http://www.coaching-courses.com/" target="blank">London</a>, <a class="blue" href="http://www.startnowcoaching.com/" target="blank">Oslo</a> and <a class="blue" href="http://www.thecoaches.co.jp/" target="blank">Tokyo</a> who have experienced our work and knew they wanted to create businesses to bring that experience to their home communities and to build a local community of professional coaches. Those intrepid individuals certainly have been and continue to be models for what is possible.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Businesses and individuals around the world are noticing. And inquiring. Many of the CTI-trained coaches, as well as the leaders who have attended coaching conferences around the world, have inspired others to pursue a co-active experience through our programs. The <a class="blue" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0891061231/102-7442025-7729746" target="blank"><i>Co-Active Coaching</i></a> book continues to give depth and breadth to the understanding of coaching. The Internet search engines easily support research and data selection. And from all of that, there are a growing number of email and telephone contacts&mdash;inspired and curious and eager professionals reaching out.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are reaching back now.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In what has become a global experiment in co-activity, CTI's International Development Team is providing direct support to entrepreneurs who are marketing and setting up local businesses that will provide the core co-active coaching curriculum&mdash;at the same level of quality-led, experiential learning that is our hallmark in our existing communities.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In the last year, we have begun offering the curriculum in <a class="blue" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@194.0tWEaLBLbt4.15684@.3c4063b7" target="blank">Tel Aviv</a>, <a class="blue" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@194.0tWEaLBLbt4.15684@.3c3fe823" target="blank">Copenhagen</a>, <a class="blue" href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx?50@194.0tWEaLBLbt4.15684@.3c3fe823" target="blank">Stockholm</a> and Istanbul. And just as we have seen from Tokyo, Oslo and London, program participants from these new ventures have chosen US-based <a class="blue" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/certification/index.html" target="blank">certification</a> and <a class="blue" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/leadership/" target="blank">leadership</a> as part of their personal and professional journeys.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In the very near future, we will be dancing with participants in Sydney and Melbourne, Barcelona and Munich. The invitations to dance are coming from communities in South Korea, China, New Zealand, Italy, Russia, Poland, Singapore and South Africa. Each day's email seems to bring a gift (and surprise) of more interest and heart-felt appreciation. It seems to far outweigh the spam these days!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Co-active coaching is growing.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Share the news, will you? Let friends and family in other countries know what might be possible. And if you know someone specifically in Istanbul, Tel-Aviv, Stockholm, Barcelona, Copenhagen or Munich, tell them co-activity is happening near them now. I have a hunch that they are already picking it up..."Level 3," you know.

	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><b>Playing with Coaching</b><br>by Gwen Gordon
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"No, you don't understand Gwen, it changed my life." I listened to the words in disbelief as I talked with one of the participants in Henry (Kimsey House's) and my recent workshop, "Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching." It was a pilot, after all, a test run for some new ideas we were developing about the connection between play and coaching mastery. The most I'd hoped for was a sign of promise, some honest feedback and a pat on the back. But when I got, "It shifted my whole way of being, not just in coaching, but in my life," I started taking this coaching and play business a lot more seriously. Uh oh. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The truth is, I've been taking play seriously for quite a while, by exploring its power in all kinds of arenas. After all, at its heart, deep, spontaneous, full-on, connected play is our true nature. I've seen it sparkling in the eyes and dancing in the creative expression of every one of my greatest teachers. When we are fully ourselves&mdash;in the current of our deepest life's work, <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0409/pic3.jpg" width="300" height="198" vspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt=""><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/images/spacer.gif" width="5" height="180" border="0" align="right" alt="">free from limiting concepts and beliefs&mdash;it turns out, we are magnificently playing. In my graduate studies in philosophy, cosmology and religion, play was a recurring theme, as much in the creative dynamics of the evolving cosmos as in images of divinity. Play is how the universe, uh, works. At our core, we are the playfulness of the universe come alive in a new form.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">So it makes sense that we, as coaches, are here to liberate our own inherently playful natures and the full play of our clients. It also makes sense that we can actually play our way to having that level of mastery as coaches. In "Come Alive!" Henry and I offer wide and wildly extravagant opportunities to explore the conditions that make play possible, how to play with the blocks to play and how to invite play when it's absent.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In my own five-year exploration writing about, teaching and studying play, what has become clear to me is that we play to the extent that we feel safe, held and cared for. Play just naturally arises in the baby if the mother/caregiver nurtures it well. So, as coaches, to liberate play, we also cultivate the capacity to hold ourselves and our clients. This can mean providing practical structures, deep empathy and compassion, or just spacious presence. Once the client feels held they can begin to take themselves lightly and enjoy their dilemma of the month, experiment wildly and get off their spots.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The other possibility of coaching as play is the mastery and ease, the delight and spontaneity that gets liberated in the coach. Play is a way to stop being so significant as coaches and to feel held in our own capacity and the wisdom of the universe enough to bring the delight of play into our practices. Henry and I are thrilled to have discovered ways of building the playground for this experiment. We are excited by its possibilities and eager to keep sharing.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i>Gwen Gordon, MA, is a graduate of the Co-Active Leadership program and teaches play at the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology and the California Institute of Integral Studies. Henry Kimsey-House, co-founder of CTI, is the main designer of the coaching course curriculum, including the Co-Active Leadership program. Today, Henry continues to develop and refine the CTI coaching curriculum, leveraging his creative insights and experience as an actor. He is also co-author of the industry best-seller</i> Co-Active Coaching.

In pursuit of that vision, she joined social change organizations that shared her views, worked on political campaigns and protested to change unfair practices that affected the quality of life in her community.
