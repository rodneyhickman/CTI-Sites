Hello, and welcome to the July edition of <i>The Inquiry!</i> I’m delighted to introduce this month’s newsletter and myself to you. My name is Chrystine Langille. I’ve just started working with CTI at our corporate headquarters in the role of VP-Marketing. As a passionate marketer and CTI-trained coach who’s committed to full expression in the world, working with CTI is a dream come true for me. This month, we also welcome Paul Byrne, a master business builder and CTI-trained coach who has just joined CTI as VP-Corporate Development. Both our arrivals are part of CTI’s vision and plan for the future. In <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a>, Shirzad Chamine, our CEO, introduces us both to you.

     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Announcement From the  CEO</b><br>
        It is with great excitement that I announce the hiring of  two critical new members to our staff. Both surpass even our highest  expectations when we began our search. Both come from our own community of  graduates and are CPCCs, have had Co-Activity deeply transform their lives, and  are joining CTI to help do the same for others. </p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Chrystine Langille</b> will be our new VP-Marketing. She brings an extensive background of 11 years in  increasingly senior roles in marketing and general management at Procter &amp;  Gamble (a multibillion-dollar global company), seven years providing strategic  consulting to senior business leaders internationally, five years as Executive  VP at an international wine company, and five years as an executive coach and  strategic business development consultant. Chrystine combines head and heart  like no one&rsquo;s business. She is Canadian born, the mother of two university-aged  children, and has just joined us from Toronto.</p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Paul Byrne</b> will  be heading our effort to take Co-Activity into corporations and organizations  as our new VP-Corporate Development. Paul brings 15 years of senior-level  experience building and managing public companies, as well as personally  advising many of the world&rsquo;s leading executives on issues ranging from HR  strategy to marketing and sales operations. Prior to becoming a CPCC, Paul  served as the European Managing Director for the Corporate Executive Board, a  $400 million corporate best-practice consulting and executive education firm.  Prior to that, Paul held various sales and general management roles at  Forrester Research. Paul has built and managed the international operations for  two &ldquo;Business Week Hot Growth Companies.&rdquo; Paul grew up in Boston, is married to  a Dutch citizen and is father of two precious little ones.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It is very exciting to me that after an extensive and broad  search of world-class talent in these positions, we found the very best talent  within our own community of graduates. I am increasingly awed by the quality of  our growing community of graduates and by what that makes possible in spreading  Co-Activity around the world. Please join me in welcoming Paul and Chrystine to  their exciting new adventure.</p>

        &ldquo;The <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i> defines  &ldquo;credential&rdquo; as evidence of a person&rsquo;s achievements or trustworthiness, usually  in the form of certificates, references, etc. The word credential comes from  the root &ldquo;credence&rdquo; which means belief. It is derived from the medieval Latin  word &ldquo;to believe.&rdquo; What do we believe about ourselves as coaches? Are we  trustworthy? Do we want to have our achievements recognized? What is important  about all this?&rdquo; Join MCC and CPCC Juhree Zimmerman as she answers these  important questions<a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Zimmerman.html" target="_blank" class="orange"> <b>in this article</b>.</a></p>

        Jeff Staggs  is an MCC and CPCC with more than 20 years of coaching experience. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Staggs.html" target="_blank" class="orange">In this article,</a></b> he shares his wisdom  on why becoming credentialed is a good idea. He says, &ldquo;Over the  years, one of the most frequent questions I have heard from coaches is, &lsquo;Should  I get certified?&rsquo; A close second is, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m certified already, why do I need to  jump through the ICF hoops?&rsquo; These are legitimate questions and deserve  thoughtful answers&mdash;ones that I will share with you based on two decades of  coaching experience.&rdquo;</p>
        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Why You Should Bother  With the Bother of Getting a Coaching Credential</b><b> </b><br>
      &ldquo;I fell in  love with coaching in my first coaching course at CTI. I remember there were  some coaches sitting in the back of the room who, we were told, were in the  &lsquo;certification process.&rsquo; Wow, I thought, maybe that&rsquo;s what makes you a masterful  coach. All I knew was that I wanted this certification,&rdquo; says Keri Kuerbis, MCC  and CPCC. She shares much about her experience and her journey in becoming  credentialed.

        <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Challenges and Triumphs in Credentialing:  My Rocky Road (Not the Ice Cream Variety)</b><br>
        &ldquo;My desire  to be a coach and to be credentialed were born simultaneously, but the road  that took me to the land of credentials was anything but straight and narrow.  In 2000, I attended a seminar with coaching pioneer Cheryl Richardson. Her  advice? &ldquo;If you are going to be a coach and a serious business owner, be a  professional and get credentialed.&rdquo;&nbsp; So,  I went looking for a training program that was accredited by ICF because I  planned on being a PCC some day,&rdquo; says Pat Barone, PCC and CPCC. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Barone.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more</a></b> about her rocky road!</p>
      
       <p style="margin: 10 0 15 0"><b>On Being a CPCC, by a CPCC-to-Be</b><br>
          In this  article, we hear the refreshing voice of Lisa Lauffer, a coach awaiting her  credential. She says, &ldquo;I am certifiable. My friends would say that has always  been true, but now that I stand on the brink of my CPCC certification, I state  it with pride. I&rsquo;ve completed my CTI courses and certification pod calls,  survived supervisions and coached clients for more than 100 hours. All I have  to do is take&mdash;and pass&mdash;The Exam, and I will be Lisa Lauffer, CPCC.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Lauffer.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read  more!</a></b></p>    </TD>
