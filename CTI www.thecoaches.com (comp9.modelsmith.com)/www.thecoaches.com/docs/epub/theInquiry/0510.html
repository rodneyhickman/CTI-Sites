(It&rsquo;s good to know who Sonja is!) She also processes all CTI invoices and pays those, reconciles bank accounts, does analysis and helps out with the accounting crew as needed, among other things. Being that she is an INFJ, she likes the detail-oriented, problem-solving aspect of her job, which she says, &ldquo;feels like completing a puzzle every time.&rdquo; She also feels trusted in her role, and this is a good thing because trust is a very important value of hers. She discovered that in the Fulfillment course that she recently completed. Sonja also values people and authenticity, and says that the best part of working at CTI is working with people who are like family to her and where she can learn something new every day.

      <p><b> The 7 Ways Process: Try-Storming Your Life</b><br>
What do you get when you combine engineering experience, Japanese continuous improvement philosophies and life coaching? About a month ago, I may have answered that question with the same look I had when trying sushi for the first time. (It wasn&rsquo;t very pretty!) As a recent full-time coach, I struggled to find a way to integrate the decade- long education and experience of being a manufacturing engineer with a totally new career as a coach. Many new coaches may be asking, &ldquo;How do we stay true to who we are and yet integrate past career experiences that may be completely separate from coaching?&rdquo; For me, the question became: &ldquo;What would it be like to apply the powerful and playful pre-production workshop experiences I encountered as a manufacturing engineer towards people&rsquo;s lives?&rdquo;<i> Explore the possibilities with</i><b> Scott Krajca</b> <b>MS, CPCC</b>, as you <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Krajca.html" target="_blank" class="orange">read this article</a>.<b> </b> </p>
      <p><b>A Visual Approach to Co-Activity: Graphic Coaching</b><br>
        Did you know that researchers estimate that upwards of 72% of the North American population are visual learners and thinkers? This means that the vast majority of our coaching clients think and learn better when visuals are used. However the standard mode of coaching&mdash;over the phone&mdash;is an auditory medium that naturally benefits only 12-18% of the population! For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with using visuals or graphics with my coaching clients. I call it &ldquo;Graphic Coaching.&rdquo; I work both face-to-face (using large sheets of poster paper to graphically &ldquo;record&rdquo; my clients&rsquo; thoughts, ideas and experiences) and also over the phone (using pre-prepared visual templates either assigned as homework between calls or filled out live while on the call). <i>Join <b>Christina Merkley, MA</b> , Graphic Coach and facilitator, for this innovative new approach to coaching by <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Merkley.html" target="_blank" class="orange">reading her article.</a> </i></p>

      <p><b>Blending Co-Activity with the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought </b><br>
  The Three Principles refer to the universal truths of Mind, Consciousness and Thought which operate inseparably in every second of our human experience. They explain the energetic interconnectedness of existence, the source of our health and well-being, the power of collective consciousness and our ability to create our reality through our thinking. These principles are the fundamental &ldquo;givens&rdquo; of humanity, clearly setting out the commonalities of human experience. Once we understand and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; these truths on an individual level, we are able to rediscover our inner resiliency and wisdom, and become deeply empowered and self-reliant. <b><i>Juliet Platt, CPCC</i></b><i>, is an independent coach and facilitator, bringing workshops, training programs and personal coaching to staff, students and parents associated with the UK education sector. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Platt.html" target="_blank" class="orange">In this article</a> she speaks about the synergy between coaching principles and the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought.</i></p>
      <p><b> </b><b> The Way of Serenity&mdash;Coaching Beyond Technique </b><br>
  I had recently received an email from my martial arts teacher with a blurb about serenity, which really got me thinking. What is serenity? And perhaps more importantly: what meaning, value or importance does serenity have in my personal life and in my life as a coach? Some of my answers are laid out before you in this article, in the hope that you may draw some benefit from them, both in your personal lives and also in your professional lives as coaches. Enjoy! <b><i> Eli Landa</i></b><i> has been training in the martial arts for more than 13 years and is also a Zen Buddhism enthusiast and practitioner. His life-long romance with the human spirit is what brought him to coaching, and this is the focus of his practice. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Landa.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read his article</a>.</i></p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 15 0"><b> </b><b> Four Principles of Spiritual Coaching: Awakening your Divine Light &amp; the Spirit of Coaching </b><br>
  Coaching is spirituality expressed. It is spirit imbuing and shaping our every word with its loving presence and divine wisdom in the moment of now. And it is offered to awaken the stirrings of your and your client&rsquo;s soul, to return home and feel the joy and peace of union with your Self. I offer you four principles that have brought me to this truth and changed the foundation upon which I coach. The first three principles were realized at various points along my coaching journey, the fourth being uniquely gifted to me in a dream. They are yours to add depth and breadth to your coaching practice. <b><i>Vince Gowmon, CPCC</i></b><i>, is a spiritual teacher &amp; coach and creator of the Four Principles of Spiritual Coaching. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Gowmon.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read on</a> to see what more he says about the Four Principles. <a name="celebration"></a></i></p></TD>
