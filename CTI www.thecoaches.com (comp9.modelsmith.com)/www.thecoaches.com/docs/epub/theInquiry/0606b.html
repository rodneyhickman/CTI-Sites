       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0606/businessdevelopment.jpg" width="150" height="120" hspace="10" align="right">We know you want to build your business in a way that is fun, alive and inspiring. We also know that it can be difficult deciding where to start and what to focus on first. Have no fear, BDP is here! 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> Our popular and effective Quick Start classes are short (two hours), fun, information-packed and inexpensive ways to start building your business. We recommend that you start with “The Smart Authentic Approach to Attracting Clients 1 & 2.” We also offer a variety of additional Quick Start classes that are sure to provide something for everyone. 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Starting in late June, we’ll be offering several free resources: a monthly telesession and free audio recordings. Stay tuned for more information! 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Due to popular demand, we’ve added several new courses and a new course scheduling process. For more information, check out the website at www.thecoaches.com/business. 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">New course titles include: 
       <ul>
         <li>	Crafting Your Unique Brand           </li>
         <li>	Your Personalized Marketing Plan           </li>
         <li>	Awesome Marketing Materials           </li>
         <li>	Financial Transformation           </li>
         <li>Developing Multiple Income Streams</li>
        </ul>
          <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In addition, we’ve modified the scheduling process so that the course days/times can be more aligned with your needs. Through this new process we’ll be better able to accommodate your schedules. 
          <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Student feedback on the program continues to be very positive. Here are a few selections from students’ feedback: 
          <blockquote>
            <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“Before I took the Quick Start classes, I thought I had to follow a rigid formula to be successful. Frankly, I was dreading it. The classes showed me how I could be totally myself AND be successful in attracting clients. My confidence is growing steadily each day. Thanks for the classes! They really helped.”
              <br>
            —J.M.              </p>
            <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">"I feel like there was a lot of extremely valuable information given to me within a short timeframe. These affordable classes are well worth the price. I would highly recommend that coaches take these classes before they finish all of their coaching courses to have more ease with finding clients. I'm really happy that I took the classes." 
              <br>
              —N.D.              </p>
            <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“I will be more confident about my unique offering (me!) and more intentional about how I want to market myself…you can’t help but be inspired to implement the tips and ideas.“ 
              <br>
              —M.D.              </p>
            <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“It was the best! The content is amazing, and the leader is brilliant—she creates such learning and opportunity and safety and leaning into…”

Stephanie is one of our admissions advisors here at CTI, but she is also the resident bunny lover and humor provider for all of us here in the office. She is a Humor type on the I Am typing scale and that is very clear to all of us. If you hear lots of giggling and/or outright belly laughs coming from a particular place in the office, chances are Stephanie’s irreverent humor is at work! Things just wouldn’t be the same around here without her.

          <b>Jennifer Britton, MES, CPT, CPCC,</b> is the founder of Potentials Realized, and her work with organizations, teams and groups through retreats, workshops and group coaching have taken her around the world—from Caribbean beaches and South American jungles to corporate boardrooms and UN Headquarters. Here, she says, “Group programs can take a range of labels—workshops, retreats or group coaching. Frequently, the label we give it is based on the most resonant language for the audience we are serving. I believe that a coaching approach can be integrated into all three activities.” To find out what the golden <b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0606/moscow.jpg" width="150" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b>nuggets are, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Britton.html" target="_blank" class="orange">read more.</a></p>
        <p><b>Culturally Bound: Designing Workshops in Another Language and for Another Culture</b>  <br>
          “The dictionaries were of no help. I sat there, surrounded by at least three thick English-Russian dictionaries and stared at the blank screen of my laptop. The Russian-language training I was hired to give was in less than a week, and I still had not produced any of the workshop materials, let alone the handouts. I was stuck and the worst of it was that I was stuck on my very first line.” Ever had this experience? <b>Margarita Gokun Silver</b>, founder of the Global Coach Center, has. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Silver.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Click here </a>to read about how she masterfully creates workshops that communicate through border lines.          </p>
        <p><b>How to Love Creating and Giving Workshops</b><br>          
          “What if it were easy to create and give workshops? What if your everyday coaching processes held the secret to your workshop content? What if organizations exist in your target audience that are hungry for speakers and waiting for you? I discovered this is all true and possible. Workshops are the number one way I get new clients, averaging one client and speaking invitation per workshop. I also reach more people, in less time, and have a greater impact. Consider how easy, natural and possible this experience can be for you!”  <b> Gail Sussman Miller</b> founded Inspired Choice to work primarily with women solopreneurs to teach them how to love business obstacles and overcome them with ease. But everyone can gain from reading this encouraging article. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Miller.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Click here </a>to read more.          </p>

Ms. ADDIE has been creating workshops for many years and her straightforward process has enabled millions to create and give successful workshops around the world.”

But when she sat down to prepare the content, she felt like her thoughts were about as inspiring as the blank computer screen staring back at her. ‘I’m sure these people have attended workshops on this topic before.

          <b>Jeffrey Van Dyk</b> and <b>Nikki Anderson</b> run Circle of Excellence Coaching, which offers workshops and group coaching.

          <b>Amy Gilmore Cairns, MA</b>, is a consultant to post-secondary and adult educators looking for paths to step fully into their power as educators. Here, she says, “I am honored to work with new or aspiring trainers and educators. Most often, their skill-building needs lie not in the mastery of the material, or even its preparation and delivery, but in how to be a trainer. How does a trainer claim and hold the space? How are the learners engaged? What about learners who want to go “off topic?” Or people who don’t understand what the trainers are trying to accomplish? There is a whole way of being and understanding that is needed to be a great trainer. Fortunately, as Co-Active coaches, you are already there.” Read what else Amy has to say by <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Cairns.html" target="_blank" class="orange">clicking here.</a> </p>
