      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Dear Co-Active Coaches, 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">December…another year nearly finished. And what a year it's been!  We launched the Co-Active Network, which now has more than 3,100 members, and celebrated the spread of Co-Activity internationally with our first Co-Active Coaching courses in Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Barcelona (in Spanish!). Our latest exciting news is the spread of Co-Activity in the corporate/organizational market, with our first course at Microsoft. Read Paul Sherman's article in CTI News.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">This month's topic is community, and, once again, our incredible community has provided us with wonderful articles. CPCCs Mary Reynolds Thompson and Stephanie Lovinger share a co-actively written article on the power of the written word in creating community, and Donne Davis shares her experience of creating community through singing. Take a moment in this hectic month and treat yourself to a delightful read.

	  CTI is proud to announce the exciting addition of Microsoft to its already impressive list of corporate clientele who currently employ the Co-Active Coaching Curriculum within their organizations. December 1st was the starting date for the very first Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals course at Microsoft!  We look forward to furthering our relationship with Microsoft as we partner with them to build a Co-Active culture throughout their worldwide organization. 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">According to the program sponsor, this was one of the highest rated, if not THE highest rated program she's ever seen at Microsoft. Hats off to our course leaders, Leslie Clark and John Vercelli for a fabulous job dancing with each other and the Microsoft participants. You guys ROCK!
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">This work would not have come to fruition without the hard work of our "Relationship Originator" and "Field Business Developer," Reuel Hunt. Reuel, an active member of the Co-Active Network (co-leader of the Parents, Kids & Families niche, organizer of the Denver Co-Active Community, key player in the Time to Change Prison Project). Thank you Reuel…YOU RULE!
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Other organizations that have utilized CTI's Co-Active Coaching Curriculum to great success are IBM, Wells Fargo, Herman Miller, Boeing, The Walt Disney Company, the EPA, Fairview Health Services and Marriott. If you work in or are affiliated with a corporation or other organization that would like to explore bringing Co-Active training in-house, please contact Stephanie Lovinger at 415-451-6000, x-41 (<a class=orange href="mailto:stephanie@thecoaches.com">stephanie@thecoaches.com</a>).
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">In closing, I just want to say how excited I am to see what's developing in our corporate/organizations market sector. How marvelous to see the magic of Co-Activity spreading to this audience. Thanks again to all who are making this possible. More exciting announcements are ahead…stay tuned. 
     <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Here's to a great 2005!

	  <BR>The words community and communication share the same root. While writing may be a solitary activity, it is one that never exists outside of community. Either you are writing for yourself in your journal, and thus more deeply connected to your community of inner voices, or you are writing for a particular group of people who share a common interest. Come experience this Co-Active dance of an article by Stephanie Lovinger and Mary Reynolds Thompson (both CPCCs), and explore the connection between writing and community.  <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/writercommunity.html" class="orange">Read the article.

She has been presenting workshops called "Rituals for All Reasons" for the past 13 years. She has been hosting quarterly song circles for the past three years and finds: "There is amazing energy created in our circle of singers. We open our hearts when we sing.
