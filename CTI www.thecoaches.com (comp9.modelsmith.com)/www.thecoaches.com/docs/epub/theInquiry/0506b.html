	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Dear Co-Active Coaches,    
	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">	   Welcome! Over the past few months, there’s been a consistent theme of growth at CTI—international expansion, new leaders, new courses. We’re continuing that theme this month, this time with a physical move for the CTI headquarters. After more than eight years, we completely outgrew our location on Second Street in San Rafael and have moved on up—literally. Read about our new home in <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a>.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Our topic this month is <em>marketing</em>: How do you effectively market yourself as a coach? What is this thing called “branding” and how does it apply to coaches? What advice would you give to a new coach starting out…or to an experienced coach wanting to take his/her business to a new level? We’re thrilled to have an abundance of <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a> from our community.

      <strong>CTI Is Moving Up!</strong> <br>
      <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0506/view_200.jpg" width="200" height="100" align="right" class="border1">Once again, change is happening at CTI. This time, it’s a new physical space for our offices. For the past eight+ years, CTI’s headquarters have been on Second Street in San Rafael, CA. Some of you may have taken your CTI courses in that building, and if you’ve stopped by to visit us in the past couple of years, you know we’ve been bursting at the seams. As our business grew, classrooms gave way to office space and our staff has grown closer and closer—literally! It was a bittersweet goodbye to leave the space that has held so many great memories…and…we’re excited to announce that CTI has moved up!
 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">   After a long search for space that would meet our needs—room for a training area, sufficient parking and the right CTI “feel”—we officially moved on June 6. Yes, that’s our building in the photo to the right. Our new space is the 6,000-square-foot fifth floor with views from the San Francisco Bay to the Marin hills and Mt. Tamalpais. We’re the only tenants of our floor and have access to the deck that surrounds the entire space.      
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Aside from the spectacular views, one of the most exciting features of our new home is a beautiful training room that we’ll be using for some of our San Rafael courses, beginning in July. If you are taking a course in the CTI headquarters building or if you just happen to be in the area, stop by and say “Hi.”

        <br>
        “In some recent work I did with a group of fellow CTI-trained coaches on how to market ourselves and generate more business, I started with the idea of ‘The Brand Called You.’ I asked each of my colleagues to write down on a piece of paper no more than five VALUES they believe define the promise they bring to their coaching clients. In other words, what is their individual brand promise?” Makes you wonder what your individual brand promise might be, doesn’t it? To find out more about this topic, <span class="orange"><span class="style1"><a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/branding.html" target="_blank">read the article</a></span></span>     by Amy Selwyn, a full-time strategy consultant and life coach who works with organizations to help define strategies for planned change.<span class="style1"></span>
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 15px"><strong>Good Coaching Is Good Marketing?</strong> <br>
“Every semester, I tell my marketing students that I see two main reasons why businesses fail, especially new entrepreneurs. Ears perk up by those taking the class because some are also wanting to start their own business. So pay attention here coaches, because if you charge for your services, you are also in business.”  <strong>Mark Stamper</strong> teaches marketing at Ivy Tech State College and is a CTI coach-in-training. He offers some valuable insight into the importance of having a good marketing strategy, the place where coaches often fall down.
