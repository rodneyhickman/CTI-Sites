	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
After an unusually long, wet winter, Spring has finally arrived here in Northern California and we’re enjoying the burst of new growth. Hope your part of the world is growing, too. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“Interactions in Coaching” is the theme for the ICF European conference happening May 18-20 in Brussels, Belgium, and CTI will be represented there by Lori Shook, Director of International Operations, and by many of our international partners. If you are attending the conference, stop by and say “Hi.” 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><span style="margin: 0 0 0 0">For CTI, one avenue of growth is the availability of Co-Active Coaching courses in an ever-expanding variety of settings. </span>
        <span style="margin: 0 0 0 0">The most recent expansion is the addition of Co-Active Coaching courses to the Continuing Studies curriculum at the University of Western Ontario. Read more in <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a>. </span>

  <b>Sean Casey  Leclaire, CPCC</b>,&nbsp;publisher of the &ldquo;Be  the Change&rdquo; e-zine and author of&nbsp;<i>Hug  an Angry Man and You Will See He Is Crying</i>, writes a compelling article  about somatic coaching in this month&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry</i>.  He says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Somatic Coaching provides a foundation for exploration  into the bliss of being in a body, of actually inhabiting a body&mdash;something that  is more difficult to do than most of us imagine. I believe we live in a time  when people are losing the ability to think reflectively and feel deeply, and  thereby tap into our spiritual nature or essence.&rdquo;&nbsp; To read more <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Leclaire.html" target="_blank" class="orange">click here.</a></b><br>

But where did it go&hellip; and how do we  get it back? Have you noticed how life in 2006 is filled with so much sitting?  Sitting in traffic, sitting at the computer, sitting in front of the TV,and  even sitting while engaging in the process of coaching.

        &ldquo;If body is the temple of the  spirit (and what else explains it really?), feelings, which come through the  body, are surely the voice of the soul. Life coaching, to make a significant  difference, must teach people to listen to that voice, their voice, and trust  it enough to live in accordance with what they hear. My experience suggests we  humans can best heed our unique voices by paying close attention to the body,  home of the heart and its treasure-trove of emotions and sensations.  Understanding that is the basis of somatic coaching.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b>Suzanne  Selby</b> <b>Grenager</b> is a life coach,  writer and spiritual mentor, certified in the holistic Rubenfeld Synergy  Method.

She is the founder of Soulistic Arts&trade; and the creator of Free the Inner  You&trade;, a movement-based program for physical, personal and global  transformation. In her article, she says, &ldquo;Your body is a mirror of who you  are. It reflects how comfortable you feel in your own skin, literally and  figuratively. Somatic coaching recognizes that the body is a powerful source of  impact, as well as information. It honors the body and all that it communicates  as a central focus and keeps it present while addressing other areas of a client&rsquo;s  life.&rdquo; To see what else Lisa has to say, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Medley.html" target="_blank" class="orange">click here</a>.

Since  1989, she has guided people in creating new ways to envision, embody, and  fulfill their purpose and heart's desires. Here she says, &ldquo;In my experience,  the common ground between somatics and coaching that makes them such natural  partners is their experiential quality and focus on energetic and intuitive  awareness. Somatics is the process of becoming aware of oneself through  attention to the ever-changing energetic patterns of the body; coaching helps  people activate and direct their life energy to achieve their goals.&rdquo; <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Siegel.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more</a>.</b> <b></b></p>
