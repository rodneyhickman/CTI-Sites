	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">	The topic in this month’s <i>Inquiry</i> is ritual, and I’m struck by how much ritual is associated with this time of year: the last few weeks of summer vacation, back-to-school specials in all the stores. Even though it’s been a long time since I was shopping for those new #2 pencils, notebooks and school clothes, the rituals of this time of year are still alive for me. I suddenly have an urge for that new box of crayons. What does this time of year evoke in you?

      <strong>What Organizations Are Hungry For: You and the Relationship Systems Difference</strong> <br>A One-Day Learning Opportunity      
      <p style="margin: 7 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0508/adbanner.gif" width="125" height="67" align="right" class="border2">Many coaches would like to work in the corporate or organizational environment. The coaches we talk to want to know what companies are looking for. In the final analysis, what organizations want is a healthy bottom line. They often act as if relationship doesn’t matter and that all individuals are replaceable like parts in a machine. Frequently coaching is brought in to an organization to buff up one of the parts (otherwise identified as either a department or employee) so that the machine can work more efficiently. What we know from many years’ experience working with organizations is that the ability to work with the team as a system is the most powerful pathway to a healthy—and sustainable—bottom line. We are unabashed evangelists for relationship work with teams in organizations.
    <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">We know that Co-Active coaches are our No. 1 allies in this mission. One of the fundamental differences between Co-Active coaches and coaches from most other schools is the appreciation for and an understanding of the power of the relationship. What we do in the Organizational and Relationship Systems curriculum is take that foundation and transfer the learning to relationships and systems. There is a crucial shift necessary and new skills to learn in the transition from working with individuals within the team to working with the system that is the team. It is the shift from coaching individuals to access their own Emotional Intelligence (EQ) to coaching the team to access the Relationship Intelligence available from the system itself.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">As more and more coaches look to the corporate world to build their coaching practices, we believe we have something to offer that is more than a competitive difference in the coaching market. The ability to understand and work with the team as a system is the key to empowered teams. This relationship systems work gets results.       
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">We also continue to look for more ways to share what we know about systems work with teams. We want to take this opportunity to invite you to a very exciting one-day Team Coaching Intensive in San Jose, CA, the day before the ICF Conference, November 9. This will be an innovative day, weaving together leading-edge technologies from three great Co-Active companies:      <ul>

  <li>The
  Center for Right Relationship,
  with Marita Fridjhon and Faith
  Fuller </li>
        <li>Stellar Team Diagnostic, with Phil Sandahl and Alexis Phillips </li>
        <li>The Next Level, with Tom Courry and Dorcas Kelley          </li>
        </ul>      
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">These companies and the principals representing them are all focused on how to assess and create interventions for teams from a systems perspective. The day will be packed with learning. You will leave with a new understanding of how to work with the team as a system, an introduction to team assessment, intervention and team coaching skills, and a portfolio of practical tools and exercises you can apply to work with teams.       
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px"><b>Date:</b> November 9, the day prior to the ICF Conference <br>

She handles the entire leader scheduling for our public and corporate offerings and all of the logistical details involved in that process. She figures since the start of her career here at CTI, she’s scheduled more than 300 courses with more than 60 hotels and made arrangements for about 70 leaders over time. Whew! It’s pretty clear that we’d be lost without Dawn in the office—especially because she is also the one who organizes our staff events, such as the company picnic, safety and ergonomics presentations, various and sundry Theme Days in the office, and all holiday dinners.

        <b>Sabrina
        M. Roblin, CPCC</b>, integrates indigenous wisdom and practices into her coaching. She designs and facilitates rituals and ceremonies, and has done vision quest work for many years. She says that, “Ritual and ceremony have been a part of the human experience for thousands of years and are most recognized as an acknowledgement of a major life transition such as a birth, death or marriage. Ritual is a powerful and transformative tool that supports and facilitates the challenge of incorporating any kind of life change, whether it be joyful or grievous, such as loss of a relationship or a job, moving into a new home, or contracting/overcoming an illness.  It is also a specific event and structure in time that the client and coach can refer back to whenever needed for meaning or inspiration.”  To read more about her experience using ritual, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/sabrinaroblin.html" target="_blank" class="orange">read her article.</a>

      “Ritual causes one to embrace all of life including its challenges rather than suppressing them. It creates intention, mindfulness, focus and purpose. This passion and desire begins or continues to inform us of the life lessons that need our attention. Pull the lesson out and examine it thoroughly without judgment. Utilize passion and desire as the driving forces to come face to face with the illusion on your path toward enlightenment,” says <b>CeCe

        <br>
        <b>Mary
        Cole, MA, MPS, ATR-BC, LPC</b>, is an artist, writer and professional coach, and has a lifelong curiosity about the marriage of energy and form. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/marycole.html" target="_blank" class="orange">In
        this article</a>, Mary shares her research in the field of ritual and transformation: “The agent of the ritual, often a shaman or priest, is the one who knows the power of the space, but is empowered only to show the way, to create ritual ways for the rites of passage through which others undergo change in significant ways. Coaches, I dare to say, are modern shamans in this sense.”

         “Coaching can be viewed as a ritual itself in that it is a confidential and sacred time in which clients connect with their coach on a regular basis to tell their stories, learn and practice ways to stay focused, celebrate both wins and losses, reflect on what they have learned on their journey, and make commitments to themselves and others. I introduce the concept of ritual right away to my clients. It forms an important part of designing the alliance.” <b>Bruce
