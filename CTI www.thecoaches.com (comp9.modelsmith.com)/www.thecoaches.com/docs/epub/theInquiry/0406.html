	<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0"><b>CTI-Japan</b><br>One of the joys of working in the CTI office is the opportunity to meet so many people in our community. We recently had the pleasure of meeting the new management team of CTI-Japan when they came to visit the United States. While we can't have them "drop by" to meet you personally, we're delighted to introduce you to them here.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Takeshi Shimamura is the new president of CTI-Japan and Fumiko Takagi has taken on the role of business operation manager. Please join us in welcoming them to the CTI community and wishing them great success.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Takeshi joined CTI-Japan as president in April 2004. Before coming to CTI-Japan, he was the general manager of the Research & Consulting Division in the Japan Research Institute, Ltd. There, he significantly contributed to the dramatic growth in the division, practicing a way of management that respects each employee's vision. Prior to joining JRI, he worked for the Sumitomo Bank.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Since the first Japanese language book about Co-Active Coaching, written by former CTI-Japan President Hidetake Enomoto, was published in Japan, the Co-Active Coaching spirit that helps people develop themselves and do good for others with respect for one another, has moved Takeshi to action. Illuminating the concept of Co-Active Coaching spirit in the society, he continues to strive to realize a society in which everyone can keep thriving, living vigorously with respect for one another, and expressing appreciation to each other. He received his CPCC certificate in 2003, and finished the Co-Active Leadership program (Misogi) in 2004.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Takeshi completed his BA in sociology at Tsukuba University in 1985. He has two sons and one daughter.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Fumiko joined CTI-Japan in April 2004. Prior to joining CTI, she worked as office manager for an IT company in Tokyo from 2001&ndash;2003, and was with an American securities firm from 1986&ndash;1999. She is now enjoying working in Tokyo, smelling Co-Active spirits in the air.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><b>ACTO</b><br>Most of you are familiar with the International Coach Federation (ICF). You may be less familiar with the Association of Coach Training Organizations (ACTO). ACTO is an organization of coach training schools, coach trainers and coaches who join together to "explore, challenge and evolve the meaning and principles of quality coaching training."
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">At the end of May, 10 of the major coaching schools and two members of the ICF board came together for a two-day ACTO Schools Conference. Sabrina Roblin, school director, represented CTI at this conference and shares her experience:
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:30">It was a very inspiring, collaborative and productive two days, discussing next steps for the evolution of the coaching industry. The metaphor for the conference was that if we as a group raise the water, then all boats will rise with it. Included in our discussion was how to better support the success of coaches in their first year or two of business and how to raise public awareness of the profession as a whole. A couple of things that were very clear from the meeting were the passion and commitment of every member of the conference, as well as the importance of the ICF and its role in the industry.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:30">We discussed trends we're seeing in the industry, including the demand for coaches and coach training in organizations, which could increase the demand for credentialed coaches over the next year or two, as well as coaches specializing in specific niches. We also discussed the great work being done in the regulatory environment to keep the distinctions between coaching and therapy and to proactively create legislation to protect coaching. Research was another topic of discussion. Research is being done to further build the credibility of coaching, and more is on the way. If you or anyone you know is involved in evidence-based research about coaching, please contact the ICF and let them know.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:30">If you haven't yet joined the ICF, please do so. Get involved in one of its committees, and help that water to rise! As was stated by Carol Courcy at the ACTO conference, "We are on the path of mastery as a profession, and it's the collective that creates the mastery, not the individual."
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:20; margin-left:30">For more information about ACTO, its web site address is <a class="blue" href="http://www.acto1.com">www.acto1.com</a>.<br>For more information about the ICF, its web site address is <a class="blue" href="http://www.coachfederation.com">www.coachfederation.com</a>.

	<p style="margin-top:7; margin-bottom:0">"Be the change you wish to see in the world," Mahatma Ghandi said. What does this mean? How do we "be the change?"

	<p style="margin-top:7; margin-bottom:0">Many of us who coach in organizations have a background or experience in organization development. Even if we don't come to coaching with OD experience, the coaching we do in organizations is often positioned as part of an organization development or organization change intervention.
	<p style="margin-top:7; margin-bottom:0">Come join us for an interesting discussion about the relationship between these two disciplines. We will consider:
	          <ul style="margin-top:7">
			  <li style="margin-top:2">How do OD and coaching complement each other?
			  <li style="margin-top:5">How are the fields unique and distinct?
			  <li style="margin-top:5">How do we, as organization coaches, divide our own practices (if we do) between these two disciplines?
			  <li style="margin-top:5">What do we see as the future of the coaching-OD relationship?</li>

	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:20">Every client is whole and creative and resourceful. Why? Because intuition makes him or her so. Intuition provides truth: the truth of what will work, in this moment. Our clients become more effective as they access and follow intuition. Kinesiology improves sensitivity to intuition for both coach and client, using the resource of the body. Always available and accessible, the body is a super-efficient communication device for intuition.
