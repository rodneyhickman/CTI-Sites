	  <p>Dear  Co-Active Coaches, </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
Welcome to the August edition of <i>The Inquiry.</i> The lazy days of summer are upon us, and so is the heat! There’s plenty to refresh you in this month’s newsletter, including several wonderful articles on the topic of staying motivated as a solopreneur. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll find in <i>The Inquiry</i> this month:
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a>, we announce that our Systems Coaching Integration course, the fifth course in the Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching (ORSC) curriculum, was accredited by the International Coach Federation for 18 continuing coaching hours. We also announce our first-ever midweek Core Curriculum coaching series in San Rafael, CA. We’ve had many requests for a midweek series, and are excited to pilot it this fall. In addition, our first-ever course in South Africa was held in August. You can read more about all of these events in CTI News.

When I think of Sabrina, the words wise, calm and compassionate come to mind. Honestly, she’s amazing! Read on to discover why we call her our resident ritual keeper. And while you’re in Community, check out what’s happening in the Co-Active Network. With more than 7,400 members and 40 niches, the calendar is full of great events. Why not join in or try something new this month?
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We invited our readers to take on some big questions related to our feature topic for <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a>: <i>Staying Motivated as a Solopreneur</i>. What challenges have you faced? How do you stay motivated when working alone? How do you recover when you become discouraged? CPCCs Joelle Jay and Margo Bebinger, and coach Janet Moore offer insights, strategies and tools on these topics that they know from personal experience really do work. I saw myself reflected in many of the situations they described, and was able to take away several suggestions I’m putting to use right now. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re pleased to announce and <a href="#celebration" class="orange">congratulate</a> CTI’s newest CPCCs. What an accomplishment!      
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s been a couple of years since we checked in with you on <i>The Inquiry</i> to get your comments and suggestions. Over the next three months, we’ll be inviting, digesting and acting on your feedback, to ensure the newsletter continues to be a powerful must-read for you. During this time, we’ll be publishing on a quarterly schedule, with our next edition appearing in October. Our featured topic will be <i>What Can’t You Be With in Your Coaching? </i>The response to our request for articles on this topic has been strong, and the material we’ve received to date is both revealing and inspiring.
