	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As summer winds down, we're beginning our annual preparations for the ICF conference being held this November in Quebec City. If you're planning to attend, be sure to stop by our booth and say "Hi." We'll tell you more about our plans as the conference gets closer.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If discussions about research on the effectiveness of coaching intrigue you, check out the pre-conference Research Symposium.  Marcia Dorfman, CPCC, is on the PR committee and shares some information about the symposium in CTI News.

Last year, this event at the Denver conference was sold out.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Symposium is bringing together coaching scholars, researchers, practitioners and clients to share ideas and build community to move the field and the profession of coaching forward. It is expected to shape the coaching research agenda for years to come.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">You'll hear presentations and participate in discussions on what research means to practicing coaches, to the profession of coaching and to coach training organizations. Should coaching be evidence-based? Should all coaches be expected to do research? How necessary is it that coaching be able to prove that it is effective? Must coaching develop a transdisciplinary theory in order to become a full profession? Are there methods that are particularly suited to coaching? How do we overcome an all-too-common fear of research?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Highlights</b> of the day-long event are:
		<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 40">

	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><b>A Coaching in Organizations Success Story</b><br>Coaching inside an organization provides benefits, challenges and rewards. If the coaching service is well defined and positioned, the coach is never at a loss for clients. Susan Clark's employer, Fairview Health Services, has provided a welcoming and supportive environment for co-active coaching. To launch this internal benefit, Susan and her colleague, Mary Stultz, simply contacted senior leaders within Fairview, told them about the work they were doing and asked to do some sample coaching with them. As you all know, the Co-Active model works! The senior leaders not only appreciated the coaching they were receiving but started sending them more clients. Susan, a CPCC, shares the exciting results of her efforts, as well as some of the factors critical to that success. <a class="blue" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/orgsuccessstory.html">Read the article</a>.
