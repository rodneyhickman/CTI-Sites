	  <p>Dear  Co-Active Coaches, </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
March…a month of drama! Or perhaps practical jokes! Winter storms alternating with a hint of spring. Just when you think you know whether to wear the warm coat or take the umbrella, everything changes and the sun is sparkling with the promise of warmth. It’s definitely not a boring or predictable month.
</p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We like a little excitement around CTI also. Last month, we announced the addition of Boston to our North American course locations. This month we have another exciting addition on the East Coast: New York. Beginning this fall, CTI will be offering our Co-Active Core Curriculum in the Big Apple. Check out the details in <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News.</a>

Those of us in the CTI headquarters office don’t get to see her often, but we know her as a smiling voice on the phone and welcome this opportunity to get to know her better. The Community section also highlights a new main community event on the Co-Active Network titled “Coaching or Therapy? You Decide,” hosted by CTI faculty member and psychotherapist Sam House. 
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Passive income for coaches is our topic for <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a> this month. We posed the questions “How have you created passive income streams? What worked; what didn’t? What suggestions do you have for coaches who want to develop passive income?” Once again, our community showered us with wonderful articles. Leslie Clark, C.J. Hayden, Marcy Nelson Garrison and Andrea Lee each share a unique perspective on how coaches can create passive income. Do your interests lean toward creating tangible products, such as books, games, CDs or calendars? Or perhaps licensing workshops or programs you’ve developed? Or maybe real estate investing or multi-level marketing programs? Sit back, relax, read these articles, and see what possibilities tickle your interest.
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As always, we love hearing the voices of our community and invite you to read the topics for upcoming issues of <i>The Inquiry</i> and think about sharing your insights by writing an article. And join us in <a href="#celebration" class="orange">celebrating</a> our newest CPCCs!

        It’s a little known fact that we have a satellite office in Sonoma County, where all details regarding our Leadership program are covered. Marsha Greenfield is a member of our staff who works in the Sebastopol office as our Retreat Services Administrator. It’s lucky for us that Marsha is truly knowledgeable about herself so that we can get to know her more easily. She says, “I was born on September 2nd (50-something years ago), a Sunday child with Sun and Moon in Virgo, Leo ascending, and born on a solar eclipse in Buffalo, NY.” To find out more about Marsha click <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Greenfield.html" target="_blank" class="orange">here.

        <p><b>Passive Revenue: It’s Not About the Money </b><br>
        “If you are open to creating a shift in your perspective about passive revenue, explore with me the following questions and some of my own experience in answering them: How can you help as many people as possible? How can you have more time available to help people? How can your impact on the world make a real difference?” <b>C.J. Hayden, MCC, CPCC</b>, is the author of <i>Get Clients Now!</i> and <i>Get Hired Now!</i> She is the founder of the Coachpreneurs Circle, where coaches learn and grow together to create passive revenue and sustainable businesses. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/CHayden.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read this article </a></b> to hear what she has to say about passive revenue.</p>
          <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0603/money.jpg" alt="It's not about the money" width="150" height="215" align="right">Product Development Land—Fasten Your Seat Belt</b><br>
            <b>Marcy Nelson-Garrison, MA, CPCC</b>, is a creativity coach, visual artist, product entrepreneur, product review columnist for<i> Choice</i> magazine and an online retailer. Join her <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Nelson-Garrison.html" target="_blank" class="orange">in this article</a></b> as she shares her experience around creating tangible coaching products. She says, “What a wonderful feeling to wake up, check your email, and find messages declaring that you’ve just made a sale. Woohooo! That’s one of the joys of passive income. Creating your own product (or product line) is one way to bring in an additional revenue stream. For those of you bursting with creative ideas, this may be the perfect business strategy for you. The benefits go beyond profit to include branding, reach and impact. Although the process to get there is far from passive, the time, energy and money you invest are worth the effort.”</p>
          <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Leadership Through Passive Income</b><br>
“Passive income is compelling to coaches because it gives us a way to deliver coaching to a much, much bigger segment of the population than we ever could solely one-on-one. It’s a different way to look at it, isn’t it? In fact, let me go just a little bit further. I believe that coaches who seek to lead in their work, will ultimately ask themselves, ‘How can I contribute to lasting change of the greatest order, beyond myself?’” Join <b>Andrea J. Lee</b>, author of <i>Multiple Streams of Coaching Income</i> and co-author of <i>Pink Spoon Marketing: The Art and Science of Building a Multiple Streams Business</i>, as she discusses ideas about leadership and passive income <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Lee.html" target="_blank" class="orange">in this article. 
        </a>
        <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>What’s Your Plan B?</b><br>
            <i><b>Creating financial wellness with passive income</b></i><br>
          “I’m a Co-Active coach and part of the CTI faculty. I live in Mexico a few blocks from the Caribbean Sea and I’m living my dream. Since I coach and lead workshops for a living, the only way I make money at that is when I <i>personally</i> am talking to my clients or standing in front of a classroom. What that means is if illness, family emergencies or hurricanes (in my case) show up, the paychecks stop coming in. So how can we coaches best ensure our financial health? Passive income.” Join <b>Leslie Clark, CPCC, PCC</b>, as she shares how she has successfully created passive income streams in her life.
