	  <p>Dear  Co-Active Coaches, </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">
Welcome to the April edition of <i>The Inquiry</i>. One of the best things about creating this newsletter each month is the opportunity to share what’s happening in the world of coaching. Whether it’s looking at CTI’s own business to see what’s new or getting to know the members of our community as we gather articles for the month, it’s always exciting to shine a light on another facet of this gem we call “coaching.”</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a> this month, Lori Shook, Director of International Operations, gives us an update on how Co-Activity is spreading around the globe. With CTI courses now being offered in locations from South Korea to Dubai, we are truly international.

In addition to being the woman behind the friendly voice that greets you when you call, Angie performs a million other duties that keep the office organized and running smoothly…and she does them all with a smile and a personal touch. With an 8-month-old daughter at home, we’re glad she has the energy to take care of us, too. Also in Community, we have some exciting calls scheduled on the Co-Active Network in the next few weeks. Check it out!
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our topic for <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a> this month is <i>Visioning</i>: What impact has visioning had on your clients/yourself? What visioning tools do you use? What structures do you use to keep the vision alive? CPCCs Dorcas Kelley, Susan Carlisle, Wendy Watkins and Sandy Brody share tips on visioning. Whether you’re developing your vision for your life, how to make your business more successful, or looking for visioning tools to use with your clients, there’s something here for you. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As always, we love hearing the voices of our community and invite you to read the topics for upcoming issues of <i>The Inquiry</i> and think about sharing your insights by writing an article. And join us in <a href="#celebration" class="orange">celebrating</a> our newest CPCCs!

       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0604/international.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" class="border2">Life on the unfolding edge of international expansion is full and exciting and very much pulled by the mysterious and compelling forces of the future.       
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> We’re fully engaged in dancing with what’s here now and, at the same time, we’re preparing for an exciting future, which we know will come faster than we can imagine. Expansion of Co-Activity is exponential! The desire for this work that we do is huge throughout the world. The requests are plenty and all are compelling! It’s fascinating to see where we’ve been pulled to, and it’s a bit of a mystery where and when the next pulls will take us. But we know more are coming—we can feel it. 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In 2005, we brought on 10 Europe-based leaders. They are well trained and doing an excellent job leading courses in front of the room. This year (on Valentine’s Day), we selected four Norwegian leaders and very much look forward to working with them in the near future. CTI courses are now running consistently in Japan, UK, Norway, Sweden, Israel and Dubai. We’re ramping up strongly in Poland and The Netherlands; both locations began around the first of this year. We’re getting started again in Istanbul this month after having run a full series of courses last year. Denmark and Spain are also offering courses on an on-going basis. We have courses planned to start for the first time later this spring in Prague and in Germany. We’re also starting up in Bergen, which is a new location for CTI Norway. Very exciting!
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Also, on the other side of the planet, South Korea recently had its first Fundamentals and it was a smashing success! We’re looking forward to cooking something up in Australia, as well. 
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s pretty incredible how far and wide we can go with Co-Activity and how it works in different places and with different cultures. We see that over and over again. There are small adjustments to make with some of our language, but the essence of Co-Active coaching and the design of our courses remains the same wherever we go. It is truly a model for all of humanity, not just a few cultures. We don’t know exactly what it’s going to look like, but we know we’re going, moving confidently and passionately toward that compelling mysterious thing called the future of CTI.

        Angie Rome Gonzalez is the woman with the lovely voice and face that first greets anyone who calls or comes in person to CTI headquarters in San Rafael.

Angie is a blessing in all of our lives and oversees this office with much love and care.

&ldquo;As  coaches we work with clients to help them develop a fulfilling vision for their  life and take action to make their vision a reality. It&rsquo;s ironic that often we  neglect to create a vision for our own lives&mdash;especially the life of our  business. Do you have a vision for your business a year from now? Two years?  Just as you benefit from having a personal vision, so, too, will you benefit  from having a business vision,&rdquo; says <b>Dorcas  Kelley</b>, author of <i>The Business of  Coaching</i> and co-founder of The Business Catalyst Institute.&#8482; &nbsp; <br>

        <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>New Foundation  Visioning: Living Your Heart&rsquo;s Desire</b><br>
           <b>Susan  Carlisle, MA, CPCC, PCC,</b> is a faculty member at The Coaches Training Institute,  where she has trained more than a thousand people to be life coaches. In this  article, she <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0604/vision.jpg" width="225" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">introduces us to the New Foundation Visioning  Process. By using it, she has observed that, &ldquo;True expectation is the energy of  aligning with the future and grounding in the present to receive the future. To  align with the future is to connect emotionally with that desire and what it  will truly give you. To ground in the present is to look at what you are  substituting in place of true expectation, be it beliefs, thoughts, feelings,  control, doubt, wishing or fears that would get in your way of honestly  expecting it to happen. These substitutes must be released in order to receive  what you believe is truly possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Carlisle.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more.</a></b></p>
          <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Tools for  Visioning</b><br>
              <b>Wendy Watkins </b>is  the<b> </b>Chief Grower of the small  business <a href="http://www.passionfruitpeople.com/">Passionfruit Creative  Business Growers</a>, an organization that supports &ldquo;People and Business in  Full Bloom.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Watkins.html" target="_blank" class="orange">In this article</a></b>, she wants to share a few of the tools that she&rsquo;s  used to make her business successful. Before she shares her tools, she  emphasizes the importance of a vision. &ldquo;I do want to mention how important it  is for us as coaches to have a clear vision of what we want to create and hold  for ourselves. It is a process to really gain clarity on this question. The  process for me began with getting crystal clear with my values. After that, I  created a visual representation of what it looked like. Yes, my friend, a  beautiful collage is what started the process of knowing what I wanted to  create in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b></b></p>
        <p style="margin: 15 0 15 0"><b>Visioning in the  Imagination with Guided Imagery</b><br>
  &ldquo;Before becoming a coach, I received training and  certification in the technique called Interactive Guided Imagery<span class="servicemark">sm</span>&nbsp; (IGI<span class="servicemark">sm</span>). Taught by the  Academy of Guided Imagery, it brings the client into a state of highly focused  concentration using sensory information. It engages the imagination by  bypassing the conscious mind in order to access the unconscious. This becomes  possible through relaxation. While it is possible to access the imagination  without deep relaxation, relaxation makes it more vivid and less prone to  gremlin hijacks. Breath work combined with envisioning a safe, special place in  visual, auditory, taste, olfactory and kinesthetic channels (see, hear, feel,  taste, smell) brings clients to their very rich, wise world.&rdquo; So writes <b>Sandy Brody, CPCC, </b>who received her  certification in Interactive Guided Imagery in 2001 and serves on the Board of  Directors for Imagery International (<a href="http://www.imageryinternational.org" target="_blank" class="orange">www.imageryinternational.org</a>),  whose members include professionals in medical and therapeutic fields. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Brody.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more.</a></b></p>
