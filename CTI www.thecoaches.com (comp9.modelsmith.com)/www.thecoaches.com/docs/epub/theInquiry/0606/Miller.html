<h1><strong>How to Love Creating  and Giving Workshops</strong></h1>
<p>What if it were easy to create and give workshops? What if  your everyday coaching processes held the secret to your workshop content? What  if organizations exist, in your target audience, that are hungry for speakers  and waiting for you?</p>
<p>I discovered this is all true and possible. Workshops are  the number one way I get new clients, averaging one client and speaking  invitation per workshop. I also reach more people, in less time, and have a  greater impact. Consider how easy, natural and possible this experience can be  for you!</p>
<p><strong>Content. </strong>It is my  joy to share two huge discoveries. 1) You have ready-made content from what you <em>already</em> know in your sleep and do  with your clients! 2) Creating a workshop is simply taking what you do well  one-on-one and doing it in front of an audience. </p>
<p>My first workshop happened by accident. I heard the City of  Chicago was seeking speakers and I offered to talk about networking, a generic  topic. The organizer immediately named it &quot;How to Love Networking&quot;  and a workshop was born. I backed into the title, pulling from the way I coach  clients to overcome obstacles by drawing from a past success and transferring  the skills and &quot;knowing&quot; to the present. I've now given that workshop  some 30 times and have started a series around other obstacles, such as &ldquo;How to  Love Speaking,&rdquo; &ldquo;How to Love Selling&rdquo; and even &ldquo;How to Love Dating!&rdquo; </p>
<p>TIP:<strong> </strong>After you  have a great coaching session, immediately outline the process you used and see  how it can be done in front of an audience. If you find a core process that  benefits many clients, then it's likely you have the seed of a workshop,  article or book. </p>
<p><strong>Delivery and  Structure. </strong>I do my best with an unscripted outline that has room to dance  in the moment. It's important to find the structure that works best for you. For  my first two workshops, I wrote down actual phrases on flip charts and found it  distracting. Today, I use a one-page outline with one line per segment. I  include time estimates to tell me where I should be on the clock at major  junctures. Leave room in your agenda to make your bottom-line points and coach  the audience so they can experience you, taste coaching and learn.</p>
<p>As for the structure, I use a well-worn popular formula. I  tell them what I'm going to tell them, then I tell them and then tell them what  I told them. I also add a strong mix of CTI-ness: I set expectations, share the  defining moments in my life that led me to my chosen niche, target audience and  this workshop, and do a grounding exercise to create safety, playfulness and  presence. I seat my audiences in a circle of chairs whenever possible to create  equality and openness. </p>
<p>And then&hellip;it's all content, coaching, passion and magic. I  ask for one or two volunteers and coach them in front of the group. I use a  written exercise that is woven throughout the workshop. This begins and ends  with a self-assessment that measures their shift in perspective, usually moving  up at least one point and as many as five points on a 10-point scale. </p>
<p>After the content, before the Q&amp;A, I offer complimentary  consultations with a clipboard sign-up that lists only a few specific dates and  times. I say these carefully chosen words, &quot;If you are serious about  making changes and want to find out how my coaching can help you reach your  goals, sign-up.&quot; About 95% keep these appointments respectfully and more  than half become clients. </p>
<p>TIP: Connect your workshop to a logical offering, whether  products, complimentary consultations or a follow-on workshop or teleclass.  Reserve time before the end to introduce this offer.</p>
<p><strong>Co-Activity. </strong>Throughout  my workshop, from the moment I am invited to speak, I seek collaborative  decisions on the topic and format, and ask in advance for the group's unique  obstacles. I invite a lot of audience participation, acknowledge their input  and see myself as facilitating from a unique perspective vs. expertise. I help  my audience see how they are already creative, resourceful, whole and talented  at the thing they fear doing. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing. </strong>How  will you find your audiences? Choose a focus and title around a tangible,  recognizable outcome that solves one of your target market&rsquo;s needs. I believe  what sells best is a title based on a concrete business-related outcome. In the  end, my participants in &quot;How to Love Networking&quot; do learn how to love  themselves and others more. I sell them what they ask for and give them what  they need.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Most of my speaking opportunities come from subtle marketing  efforts. I simply ask my audiences for introductions to contacts who look for  speakers. I don't ask for referrals, rather warm, personal introductory emails  copying me and the contact. I get invited to speak because I am clear about my  target audience&mdash;solopreneur women. The majority of my marketing is through networking,  naturally! </p>
<p>TIP: Declare a population you serve, go to the library  reference section and ask for the Encyclopedia of Associations. Locate your  audience, and you'll find places to write and speak. Serve your audience  wherever you can; be willing to speak almost anywhere for an amount they can  afford.</p>
<p>Consider collaborating with a CTI buddy. My first speaking  effort as a coach was as one of six coaches, mostly CTI-trained, at a Borders  bookstore, where I delivered five minutes of the hour's content. I was hooked.  For my first few solo gigs, I invited a CTI coach to be my  &quot;assistant&quot; so I could have support and help getting grounded. </p>
<p>In closing, be a coach and shine as an extension of what you  naturally love to do. Workshops are another means for creating and giving. </p>
<p>Repeat after me: &ldquo;I know enough today to create a workshop  that spotlights my existing coaching talents to a room filled with my target  audience.&rdquo; What one easy step will you take after reading this article? </p>
<p>Your audience is waiting.</p>
