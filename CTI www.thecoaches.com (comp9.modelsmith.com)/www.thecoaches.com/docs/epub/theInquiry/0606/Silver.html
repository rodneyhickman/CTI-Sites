<h1><strong>Culturally Bound:  Designing Workshops in Another Language and for Another Culture</strong></h1>
<p>The dictionaries were of no help. I sat there, surrounded by  at least three thick English-Russian dictionaries, and stared at the blank  screen of my laptop. The Russian-language training I was hired to give was in  less than a week and I still had not produced any of the workshop materials,  let alone the handouts. I was stuck and the worst of it was that I was stuck on  my very first line. </p>
<p>Usually, I start my workshops with a mingle, where people  share their passions. &ldquo;What is your passion?&rdquo; they would ask each other, the  point of the exercise being the discovery of that hidden energy that drives us  and makes us who we are. But as soon as I sat down and typed the word &ldquo;<em>stras&rsquo;t</em>&rdquo;&mdash;the exact Russian translation  of the word passion&mdash;I knew that both the question and the exercise would never  work, if I translated them as they were. Not only did the word &ldquo;<em>stras&rsquo;t</em>&rdquo; carry a completely different  feeling for a Russian speaker, but also the concept of having a &ldquo;passion&rdquo; or  &ldquo;being passionate&rdquo; about something was foreign. Or, if not foreign, then it was  &ldquo;<em>khorosho zabitoe staroe</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;the  well-forgotten past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For years and perhaps even for centuries, people living in  Russia and its empire were discouraged from having passions and aspirations for  themselves. Their &ldquo;wants&rdquo; always had to be in conformity with either the Tsar,  the Church, the Communist party, the community committee, or some other  organization that required their loyalty at one time or another. Sure, people  had hobbies and things they liked to do, but they could not have a vision. Being  a visionary and being yourself was considered a selfish, self-serving and  individualistic exercise and, unless it served some collective purpose, it was  discouraged, ridiculed and persecuted. </p>
<p>The last 70 years of communism were particularly harsh on  the &ldquo;visionaries.&rdquo; Those who dared were shamed by their teachers and superiors,  embarrassed before their peers and humiliated so that they would forever be  afraid to become who they wanted to become. As a result, no one wanted to risk  showing who they really were, lest they be marginalized and laughed at. </p>
<p>Although things are slowly changing, this mentality is long  from being gone. People are still reluctant to trust each other and to share  their innermost desires and feelings. Words such as &ldquo;passion&rdquo; and &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo;  don&rsquo;t translate the meaning they are meant to carry and need a complicated  explanation instead. Thinking out of the box is far and between and, as  coaches, we have to be very careful about getting people to respond without  offending them or shutting them down. </p>
<p>So, as I sat there with my laptop already on screensaver, I  considered what it was I really wanted as a response. What was I after? I knew  I needed the energy to jumpstart the workshop. I knew I needed to fire up the  atmosphere to encourage people to participate (another tricky exercise in  Russia). And I knew I wanted my audience to get something out of it as opposed  to simply taking notes and looking at their watches, as often happens at  Russian trainings. I had to shake them up and get them to step beyond the  barriers they&rsquo;ve imposed on themselves, but I needed to do it carefully. I had  to be culturally bound.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to start with a mingle, but instead of  passion I used the word &ldquo;dream.&rdquo; While still out of the ordinary, the word  &ldquo;dream&rdquo; at least carries less of a negative connotation and fear of being  ridiculed<strong>. </strong>Nevertheless,  at least 60 percent of my participants named the dreams they thought they <strong>should</strong> name instead of those they  really had&mdash;another leftover habit of the Communist past. Yet I was happy to get  the other 40 percent to share their real dreams, and I was ecstatic to see the  sparkles in their eyes when they talked about those dreams. </p>
<p>That was my first workshop in Russia, and it actually went a  lot better than I thought it would. Since  then, I&rsquo;ve done a few more, and each time I try to push the boundary just a bit  further. Yet I always know that it can go only so far and that being culturally  bound does not mean that I am compromising the coaching experience for my  audience. Everyone arrives at where they want to be through their own journeys.  For people who were born and grew up in Russia,  those journeys may not be as straight-forward as for people living elsewhere.</p>
