<h1><strong>You&rsquo;ve Been Asked to Give a Workshop&mdash;Now  What?</strong></h1>
<p>Mary had  accepted an invitation to present a workshop. But when she sat down to prepare  the content, she felt like her thoughts were about as inspiring as the blank  computer screen staring back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure  these people have attended workshops on this topic before. How can I possibly  make it new and interesting for them?&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Come to think of it, why  did I even accept this project in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever been  there? Me too&mdash;and that&rsquo;s how I learned to use a valuable tool that I call  &ldquo;Operation Brain Dump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, before  you say, &ldquo;Yes, but first there has to be something in my brain to dump,&rdquo; let me  assure you that you have a lot to offer and people are waiting to hear it.</p>
<p>As coaches,  we are trained to ask great questions. And that&rsquo;s exactly where to start when  creating a winner workshop. Before I give you the step-by-step process to help  you effectively use &ldquo;Operation Brain Dump,&rdquo; here are three tips with useful  questions to ask prior to writing your workshop content. </p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Be curious. </em>If someone invited you to deliver  your workshop to their group, don&rsquo;t try to prepare it in the fog by assuming  you know their organization. Find out as much as you can about them. Go to  their website. Talk to people who are members. Read their promotional  materials. </li>
  <li><em>Be Co-Active.</em> The Co-Active coaching model that  we use with our clients is also applicable to preparing and delivering a  workshop. Start by designing an alliance with the organizers who asked you to  lead the workshop. Ask them questions. Find out the purpose of the overall  event that your workshop is part of and what their goal is for your workshop.</li>
  <li><em>Be focused.</em> Don&rsquo;t try to prepare your material  for the masses. When you attempt to reach everyone, you end up reaching no one.  Again, ask questions of the organizers. What can they tell you about the people  who will be attending the workshop? Who are they&mdash;really? What kind of  experience would the planners like the attendees to have? What would they like  them to take away from the workshop? </li>
</ol>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve  taken these tips to heart and done your homework, you&rsquo;ll be in a better  position to connect your message to the audience&rsquo;s needs. You&rsquo;ll know what  illustrations and metaphors they&rsquo;ll relate to. You&rsquo;ll know what activities and  visuals will appeal to them. And you&rsquo;ll be clearer on what your focus needs to  be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also  likely to feel like you have more information and ideas than you can handle.  That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;Operation Brain Dump&rdquo; comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gather the right tools: 2&rdquo; x 2&rdquo;  post-it notes, felt pen, blank wall in your home or office.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Write one thought (maximum four  words) on a post-it note and stick it on the wall. Don&rsquo;t reason the thought  away; just &ldquo;dump&rdquo; it. If a thought comes up that doesn&rsquo;t seem to relate to your  workshop, put it on the wall anyway. You never know how it might fit in later. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat this process until all your  thoughts are out (one thought per post-it note). Don&rsquo;t try to organize the  post-its; just get them on the wall. If you have a thought that&rsquo;s similar to  one you&rsquo;ve already posted, write it down anyway and put it on the wall.  Different wording can stimulate other perspectives and lead you down new paths  of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> By the time you&rsquo;ve downloaded  everything you can think of, you will have a menagerie of sticky notes all over  your wall. Now step back and look for the common threads.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Organize the common thoughts by  moving post-it notes into one-theme clusters or groups. If another idea comes  up while you&rsquo;re doing this, jot it down and put it on the wall. If there are  items that don&rsquo;t seem to relate to anything about your workshop, put them in a  group by themselves. They may end up being useful as illustrations or just  miscellaneous thoughts that you needed to acknowledge and set aside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once you have all the post-its in  groups, name each group and place the title on the wall with the applicable  group. Sometimes a different color post-it or pen is useful to distinguish the  title from the individual post-it thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Step back again, and see if there  are any ideas that you&rsquo;d like to move to a different group. If more thoughts  come to mind, write them down and add them to the mix.</p>
<p>Depending  on the approach you take with grouping your thoughts, you may end up with an  outline for your workshop or a timeline for getting the work done or&hellip; </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel  clearer. The process of &ldquo;Operation Brain Dump&rdquo; is an excellent tool for  clearing your mind and gaining focus. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve shared this technique  with many clients to help them with everything from brainstorming website  content and writing a proposal to determining next steps on a business issue  and planning a wedding. Their experiences have been expressed as: &ldquo;I feel like  a load has been lifted from my shoulders&rdquo; and &ldquo;My head doesn&rsquo;t feel like mush  anymore&rdquo; and &ldquo;Now I know exactly what I need to do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In my own  experience, I&rsquo;ve found that, once I completed these steps, I was free to create  from a de-cluttered mind and not be afraid I&rsquo;d miss an important point I wanted  to remember. I was able to move my thoughts from the wall to my computer, flesh  out my presentation, and develop PowerPoint slides from the outline that had  evolved through this process.</p>
<p><em>Warning</em>: Be prepared for family or friends  who visit while you&rsquo;re working on &ldquo;Operation Brain Dump.&rdquo; They may think you&rsquo;ve  really lost it and are now taking up weird decorating techniques!<br />
