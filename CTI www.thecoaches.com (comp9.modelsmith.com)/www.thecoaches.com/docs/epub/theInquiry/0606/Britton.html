<h1>Golden Nuggets for Your Workshop Success</h1>
<p>Workshops for individuals or  organizations can be a powerful and inspirational learning process, and great  for business! Running workshops, retreats and group coaching programs are part  of the core foundation of my business. I believe that these activities provide  us with the opportunity to expand our work as coaches to a wider audience.  Since 1988, I have been privileged to run hundreds of workshops and retreats  around the world, and in this article I want to share some golden nuggets for  YOUR workshop success.</p>
<p>Group programs can take a  range of labels&mdash;workshops, retreats or group coaching. Frequently, the label we  give it is based on the most resonant language for the audience we are serving.  I believe that a coaching approach can be integrated into all three activities.  In their truest essence, workshops are often seen as a &ldquo;training&rdquo; opportunity.  Training traditionally focuses on the acquisition of Knowledge, Skills and  Abilities (the KSAs). Retreats are often seen as an opportunity for  organizations and individuals to recharge, focus on important issues and  acquire deeper self-awareness. Group Coaching, a vibrant evolving area of our  profession, follows along this continuum and weaves the best of our individual coaching  skills into the group context. Throughout this article, the principles I speak  about are applicable to all three activities.</p>
<p>Workshops and Co-Activity go  hand-in-hand. As a Co-Active coach, you already have a solid skill foundation  to build upon for workshop success. You can augment these skills with further  learning in the areas of group process, experiential and adult education, and  facilitation.</p>
<p>What is your vision for  workshops and group work? If you are considering expanding your work into this  rich area, here are some practical tips and tools I want to share with you:</p>
<p><strong>1. Know your audience. </strong>A key to successful workshop design is to know your  audience. We dedicate our work to holding the client&rsquo;s agenda, incorporating  introductory/discovery sessions to finding out about our clients, their goals  and what they want from us. We can also spend time getting to know our  participants when running group programs. </p>
<p>For most of my programs  (including corporate programs), I dedicate a significant amount of time to getting  to know my participants before the program. I schedule pre-course one-on-ones  to find out more about <em>who they are</em>, <em>what  their needs are and what they want to take away from the program</em>. Knowing  about your clients <em>before you even meet them</em> in a workshop setting will  allow you to hold the client&rsquo;s agenda and amplify the results of your program.</p>
<p><strong>2. Less is more (the 80/20 rule).</strong> Like many things in life, less is more, especially  when it comes to workshops. We are often so excited to give our best value that  we try to pack too much into a program. It&rsquo;s like a powerful question&mdash;you need  to pause to let people reflect. Without the pause, the opportunity for learning  is lost. Are you allowing your participants enough time to reflect, think,  discover, dream and plan? Chances are your program may be too content heavy.</p>
<p>I often speak about the  80/20 rule. Take a look at your program, Divide it into 80% of what you want to  keep and set aside 20%. This 20% can become the basis of a new workshop or a  whole new product line. By removing 20% of your original content you are  freeing up space for your clients to do the really juicy and life-changing  work. Try it out!</p>
<p><strong>3. Have clients assess  the impact of your program. </strong>Sometimes  coaches say to me that they don&rsquo;t think that their program was successful. I  ask the coach, &ldquo;What did the participants think?&rdquo; Just as in one-on-one  coaching, the perspective of the client with respect to their learning is most  important. Coaches who have asked this question have received glowing reports  from the participants.</p>
<p>Evaluation is often  overlooked. Ensure that you evaluate your program immediately. If possible,  follow-up with participants four to eight weeks after the event. How has your  program made an impact on their lives (and work) in the short term? In the  longer term? This information is also critical for marketing purposes, as well  as for future program design. What really stuck with participants? What do they  want more of? Answers to these questions can support you in future product  development.</p>
<p><strong>4. Consider your  marketing. </strong>The word marketing  usually creates a strong, emotional response in a coach or business owner.  Regardless of how great a program you have designed, what is the impact if  nobody shows up? Marketing takes time and effort. Depending on your perspective,  it can be a lot of fun! </p>
<p>Last year, I spoke to the  ICF Retreat SIG on Marketing Success Strategies for Retreats. Many of the  coaches were surprised by the facts I provided. Marketing requires perseverance  and creativity. Your best &ldquo;customers&rdquo; are those who know you&mdash;those who have  seen you speak, or who have purchased your other services. Workshops are a  great opportunity to get yourself known by a larger group of people. Often  workshop participants become individual clients, and many times, individual  clients attend workshops.</p>
<p>Do you have a marketing  plan? A marketing budget? If not, I&rsquo;d strongly encourage you to develop one.  Consider multiple marketing approaches for your programs &ndash; referral, word of  mouth, Internet, ezines, blogs. Where do workshops and other group programs fit  into your overall product mix?</p>
<p><strong>5. Notice your learning. </strong>One of the greatest things I love about working with  teams and groups is the learning I personally take away from a program. What  are you learning about yourself, your skills and your work as you move through  a program? Who are you being and becoming?</p>
<p>As you move forward in  breathing life into your vision for workshops, keep these golden nuggets in  mind. They have helped me and I hope they support you! Enjoy the journey and  spread your gifts to a wider audience. I&rsquo;d love to hear about where it takes  you!</p>
