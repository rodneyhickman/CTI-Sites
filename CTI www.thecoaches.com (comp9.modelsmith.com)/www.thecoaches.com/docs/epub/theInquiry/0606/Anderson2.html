<h1>A Newly Discovered Co-Activity</h1>
<p>Nikki Anderson and I met in &ldquo;Synergy&rdquo; and  instantly recognized the light in one another and the spark of excitement  between us. We started supporting one another as we built our coaching  practices and became guinea pigs for a relationship coaching session this past  November, where we discovered that our relationship wanted to move to the next  level: business partners. </p>
<p>What we discovered when starting to design and  lead workshops together is that not only do our own Saboteurs rear their heads  from time to time&mdash;they sometimes collude or argue with each other! In this  equation, Level 1 + Level 1 does not equal Level 2.</p>
<p>Our saving grace is that we both have a strong  spiritual life and decided to consciously bring Spirit into our  relationship&mdash;and this invitation shifts everything for us. The agreement now is  that we don&rsquo;t do any work until we ground with each other in meditation and  prayer. We simply invite Spirit into our work and ask the Universe to guide us  and show us what is needed. This is a slight variation on the relationship  triangle diagram we were taught at CTI. In this Spirit-led triangle, the  leaders are in one corner, the clients or attendees in the other, and Spirit is  at the top of the triangle, in the midst of the relationship. That&rsquo;s where the  magic happens!&nbsp; </p>
<p>When creating content, we don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;think up&rdquo;  the content&mdash;we ask Spirit to guide us, and we listen. What we&rsquo;ve noticed is  that the information we receive seems to hit the Level 3 in our workshops spot-on.  When it comes to leading, we&rsquo;ve found that after grounding in meditation and  prayer, we are better able to serve, respond to and connect to both each other  and the group we are standing before. Additionally, when we as leaders are  connected, we are better able to source what the group is wanting and needing,  thus enabling us to present a much more appealing and engaging workshop. This  is our brand of Co-Activity in leading.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been amazing about this process is that our  muscle of connectedness has strengthened to the point that each of us knows  when we&rsquo;re off, either with each other or with the group. And in that instant,  we can transparently speak the truth: that something is off and it&rsquo;s time to  take a breath and come back together. With this tool of recognition, we also  have more mobility to &ldquo;dance in the moment&rdquo; as we engage in group activities.  This means that sometimes things land and sometimes they don&rsquo;t (similar to  individual coaching), thereby leading in new directions that often aren&rsquo;t anticipated.  What&rsquo;s important is the involvement of our participants. They aren&rsquo;t just  hearing great ideas&mdash;they are sourcing them. They are coming from intelligence  and participation of the Level 3. In this, we are acknowledging them as  naturally creative, resourceful and whole.</p>
<p>So whatever you name it&mdash;Spirit, God, Allah, the  Universe, or the &ldquo;Level 3&rdquo;&mdash;we invite you to put your attention there. It will  lead you deftly and swiftly to what is called for in every moment, giving you  the freedom to dance with your audience and truly connect with them in a deep,  authentic and joyfully fun way!</p>

Coaching.com</a>), which offers workshops and group coaching. With a vision of providing circles  of excellence in multiple of arenas of life, we had our first workshop on  January 3 and started coaching clients in a group setting a few  months later. We have been running strong ever since. Our larger vision is to  move into the corporate world and help it transition from a triangular shaped  top-down management style to a circular style which taps the potential and  honors the contributions of all employees, thereby increasing productivity and  employee satisfaction.</p>
