<h1><strong>An Insider&rsquo;s Peak Into the Secret World of  Successful Workshops</strong></h1>
<p>Shhh, I did not  receive permission from Ms. ADDIE to let you take a peak inside the double top  secret workshop lab. But I feel this is too important and I must share it with  you. Ms. ADDIE has been creating workshops for many years, and her  straightforward process has enabled millions to create and give successful  workshops around the world.</p>
<p>Here are the five  double top secrets to giving and creating a workshop:</p>
<p><strong>Secret #1</strong>: <strong>A</strong>nalyze: Before you begin any workshop, you  need to ask a lot of questions about what you want the workshop to accomplish.  This is very similar in purpose to coaching when you conduct an intake session.  You are establishing a foundation from which to begin the coaching sessions. </p>
<p><strong>Secret #2</strong>: <strong>D</strong>esign: This is your &ldquo;outline&rdquo; of the  workshop, and you begin with the end in mind. What do you want to accomplish by  the end of the workshop? What do you want the participants to walk away with? The  four main ingredients to the Design phase are: </p>
<p>1. Workshop Objectives <br />
  2. Introduction <br />
  3. Main Points/Body of the Workshop <br />
  4. Conclusion<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  Does this sound  familiar? If you have ever taken a writing course, this may sound oddly  familiar. Also, consider how you want to deliver your workshop: in person,  teleclass, outside, inside a classroom? Consider the environment and ask the  following questions: how, what, where, when and why.</p>
<p><strong>Secret #3</strong>: <strong>D</strong>evelop: Now we are at the heart and soul  of the workshop. Working off the outline you created for the Design and the  Analysis phase, you now can create the actual workshop. This means writing the  content for the workshop. </p>
<p>*HEADS UP* The  development phase can be the wall that some people can&rsquo;t quite get over. You  have all of the content in your head, so how in the world do you get it onto  paper? This is where you can utilize your amazing skills as a coach by asking  yourself questions. Be curious, and choose the perspective of your ideal  participant. If you were in a one-on-one conversation with your ideal  participant on your workshop topic, what would you be saying?<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  *TIP* Use a tape  recorder to capture the conversation, or write it down. The big thing is to get  the jumbled ideas in your head down on paper. Other ways to download the  content from your head onto paper is to use another coach or training  development specialist. A coach would be able to help &ldquo;pull&rdquo; the information  out of you. A training development specialist is trained in developing  workshops and knows the right questions to ask to assist in developing the  content for your workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Secret #4</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>I</strong>mplement:  Ms. ADDIE is a firm believer in &ldquo;testing&rdquo; a workshop. Once you have a draft of  your workshop content and you have answered the questions of how and where,  test the workshop. Similar to prototyping a product, your workshop is a work in  progress and before you rollout it out, test the market.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Secret #5</strong>: <strong>E</strong>valuate: CRITICAL! A successful workshop  is constantly evolving to meet participants&rsquo; expectations. After you conduct  your &ldquo;test&rdquo; workshop, administer evaluations to each of the participants to  comment on the workshop. You want feedback, so don&rsquo;t be afraid of what they  might say; this is for your benefit and, more importantly, for the benefit of your  future participants. You want to create the best workshop possible and the  evaluations will help guide you on how to improve it.</p>
<p>Yikes! Ms. ADDIE  just found out that I am sharing her five double top secrets for giving and  creating workshops. So I might as well introduce you to Ms. ADDIE, <strong>A</strong>nalyze, <strong>D</strong>esign, <strong>D</strong>evelop, <strong>I</strong>mplement, <strong>E</strong>valuate, or secrets 1 &ndash; 5. I met Ms. ADDIE while attending my  Master&rsquo;s of Education Program at the University of Minnesota. It is something  that I have used a lot and by sharing it with you, I hope Ms. ADDIE will be  your guide in creating amazing workshops!</p>
<p>As a bonus I have  included three tips that I have learned from my experience as a learning and  development consultant. By combining the secrets from Ms. ADDIE and these three  bonus tips, you will be on your way to creating and giving a super fantastic  workshop. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong><br />
    <strong>1.</strong> <strong>LOVE your workshop topic</strong>:  If you love your topic, the entire process will be easy. If you notice that you  are struggling to create your workshop, take a moment and ask yourself on a  scale of 1-10 how excited you are about this topic. If you do not LOVE your  topic, it will be hard to create the workshop, and if you don&rsquo;t love it, your  participants will see it from a mile away. You will lose them immediately&mdash;why  should they love the workshop if you don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Make it fun marketing</strong>: How do you get the word out about your  workshop? </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Create a postcard for your networking events that       outlines the benefits of your workshop, time, place, registration       information, and why in the world they should attend. What feeling can you       tap into that would draw them to your workshop? </li>
  <li>Use your niche. This is where Tip #1 can been       utilized. When you love your topic and it is something your niche needs,       ask them to come. </li>
  <li>If you have an ezine, post it as a must-attend       event! </li>
  <li>Attend conferences and hand out your postcards. </li>
  <li>Hold a pre-workshop question-and-answer       teleclass. Introduce your workshop to others by allowing them to ask       questions and create the buzz.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Use what you know</strong>: Many of you have attended the CTI core  curriculum classes and other workshops. What parts of the classes did you enjoy  the most? Do you like the experiential manner in which the CTI courses were  delivered? How can you incorporate some of your favorite workshop techniques  into your workshop?</p>
<p>*HEADS UP* Some  of your favorite workshops may be copyrighted, so before using an idea from  your favorite workshop, please contact the company and ask.</p>
