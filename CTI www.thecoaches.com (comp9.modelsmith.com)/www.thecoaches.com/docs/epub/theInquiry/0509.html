	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">	Welcome to the September edition of <i>The Inquiry</i>. At the top of many of our minds recently is the aftermath of hurricane Katrina here in the United States. Our hearts go out to all those who have suffered and continue to suffer as a result. I’m also increasingly aware that this disaster joins a long list of natural disasters and conflicts that bring devastation, pain and suffering throughout the globe each day and how these events also give rise to an incredible outpouring of love, support and compassion. 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">The coaching community is certainly a part of the outpouring of support. Individuals and groups from across the country and across the globe are coming together to provide aid in many different ways. In

	<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px"> response to the commitment of the members of our own Co-Active community, we&rsquo;ve recently created a new community on the Co-Active Network, the Katrina Co-Active Initiative, for those who want to contribute in various ways. Read more about this new collaboration under <a href="#community" class="orange">Community</a>.
<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Also in our Community section this month, we continue introducing you to the staff here at CTI. If you’ve applied for a student loan for CTI courses through SLM Financial or TERI, you may have spoken to Jennet Lee. However, administering the student loan program is only a tiny part of her role. As “ultimate particle wrangler,” Jennet gathers, tracks and organizes a multitude of details throughout CTI…always with a smile.
    <p> In <a href="#cti-news" class="orange">CTI News</a> this month, read about two of our newer programs, Vision Story and Come Alive!, each of which is being offered one more time in 2005. </p>    
	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">The topic for this month’s<i> Inquiry</i> is Research and Return on Investment (ROI): How do you know whether coaching is working—either with individual clients or in an organizational setting? What were the results of any research you’ve done? How have you measured the ROI of bringing coaching into an organization? Our <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a> address these questions from a variety of perspectives. CTI faculty member Art Shirk, PCC, CPCC, shares an excerpt from his white paper on the Organizational Impact of Co-Active Coaching. Susan Jeska, RN, MBA, EdD, and Ute Kueffner, CPCC, each share their experience regarding the impact of coaching within an organization. We also have two articles from groups who have conducted research on the results of coaching—Merrill Anderson, PhD, and Dianna Anderson, MCC, from MextrixGlobal, LLC, and coaches Jan Rams&oslash;y and Sigrid Stover Kjeldsen, from CoachConnect. Our final article by coach Amy Selwyn takes a softer look at ROI.     
	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">As always, we invite you to read the topics for upcoming issues of <i>The Inquiry</i> and think about sharing your insights by writing an article. And join us in <a href="#celebration" class="orange">celebrating</a> our newest CPCCs.

      <p> <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0507/1.jpg" width="200" height="131" align="right" class="border2">CTI&rsquo;s pioneering innovations in coaching and leadership have resulted from a continual loop of piloting new cutting-edge ideas and learning from participants&rsquo; reactions and feedback. The Magic Shop enables CTI&rsquo;s founders to continue to innovate and pilot new ideas. As participants in these pilots, you get to experience the latest creations of these industry visionaries and play a role in shaping our industry's future. </p>
      <p> This latest program coming out of The Magic Shop is sure to change your life by beginning at the beginning and asking the crucial questions one often dodges asking oneself: </p>
      <ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What is next for my life and how can I consciously create what I want?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What do I need to leave behind in order to do that?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What is the story that I tell about myself to others? What is the story that I want to tell?&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>      
      <p> In this two-day <b>Vision Story</b> workshop, you will: </p>      <ul>

        <li> Come away with an inspired and focused Vision Story that will lead to manifesting the fullest sense of who you are in your life. </li>
        <li> Burn through the limiting beliefs that hold you back and take the next steps beyond them to make your vision real. </li>
        <li> Work from a place of clarity and congruence, created by internally aligning with yourself. </li>
        <li> Be witnessed in community as you commit to the path you most desire to take in your life. </li>
        <li> Not only come away with increased fuel and motivation for yourself in moving forward but also learn how to use this tool to inspire and excite your clients. </li>
        </ul>      
      <p>Here&rsquo;s what participants in the first pilot had to say:</p>      
      <p><i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve owned my deepest and longest dream! I&rsquo;ve experienced the hugeness of both my feelings of fear and excitement around this dream! It has been profound.&rdquo;</i> <br>&mdash;Michele Balk </p>
      <p><i>&ldquo;I now have a specific plan with accountability for my vision. Prior to attending, it was a concept that I couldn&rsquo;t seem to jumpstart.&rdquo; </i> <br>&mdash;Cindy Rubin </p>

     <br>Spearheaded by organizers Jeremy Stover and Heather Cummings, the Katrina Co-Active Initiative community on the Co-Active Network was created to provide structure for the efforts of members of the Co-Active Network who want to contribute in various ways to the victims of hurricane Katrina. The first activity of this community was a call earlier this week entitled &ldquo;Being with Disaster&rdquo; which was a chance for participants to expand their ability to be with disaster&mdash;for the sake of their clients and the world. Go to the Katrina Co-Active Leadership Initiative community to learn more about the resources and activities being planned. </p>

The goal is to empower and support them by sharing resources, ideas and solutions to expand Co-Activity into our communities. </p>
     <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The purpose of the Co-Active Network is to support every member in achieving his/her greatest vision for Co-Active coaching and leadership in the world. Each community has resources, discussions and community events. Check the full calendar on the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com" target="_blank" class="orange">Co-Active Network</a>.

She has 14 years of business experience in various leadership roles. Here she tells us a bit about her experience blending coaching with business needs. &ldquo;I headed a sales development program, run as a pilot in North America and Europe. It focused on enhancing negotiation effectiveness, mainly through managers applying a coaching approach with their account executives working on customer deals. The business impact we wanted to achieve was a reduced sales cycle time and an increased deal size. Business impact and the focus of the program were defined by sales executives.&rdquo; <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Kueffner.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more</a> </b><b></b>about what happened. </p>

      <p style="margin: 10 0 15 0"><b> </b><b>Measuring ROI in Coaching Relationships </b><br>
     &ldquo;Many of us believe that terms like ROI are strictly for the MBA crowd: the hard-core business people who live, breathe and actually enjoy talking about things like financial performance and indicators. Not true. In coaching, when we ask our clients to pay for our coaching services, we are asking them to invest in coaching and we are &ldquo;promising&rdquo; a solid return on things like greater awareness of personal values, the ability to see different perspectives, and the awareness of what fulfillment means to the client.&rdquo; <b>Amy Selwyn</b> is a full-time strategy consultant and life coach. In addition to a private coaching practice, Amy works with organizations to help define strategies for planned change. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Selwyn.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more</a></b> about her take on ROI within the coaching relationship. </p>
