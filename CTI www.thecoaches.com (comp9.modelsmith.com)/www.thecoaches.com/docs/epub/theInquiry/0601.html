Those of us who  have the privilege of working in the office with her also get to enjoy her  fantastic chocolate chip cookies. Yum! </p>
	 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We are  thrilled this month to have an abundance of <a href="#articles" class="orange">articles</a>  on the topic of assessments. What assessment tools do you use in your coaching  business? How do you use them? When do you use them? CTI course leader Phil  Sandahl, CPCC, shares information on an instrument for assessing the team as a  system. CPCCs Mary Jo Hazard, Hal Hendrix and Andrea Sigetich and coach Vicky Jo  Varner share their experiences with various assessment instruments for  individuals. They provide an educational look at how assessment instruments can  inform your coaching.</p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We love  hearing the voices of our community and invite you to read the topics for  upcoming issues of <i>The Inquiry</i> and  think about sharing your insights by writing an article.

	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">On a final  note, the new year/new dream idea is particularly relevant for me as we begin  2006. At the end of January, I&rsquo;ll be leaving my role as Director of Marketing  at CTI, which makes this month&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry</i> my last in this role. To all of you who have contributed to this newsletter  over the past two years&mdash;those who have submitted articles, those who have  called or written to give me feedback, the folks at Claire Communications who  make it beautiful each month, and of course, my assistant Heidi who edits  articles, proofreads, maintains the database and so much more&mdash;I extend a huge  &ldquo;Thank You!&rdquo; </p>
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">These years  at CTI have been a true gift&mdash;it&rsquo;s an incredible place to work, with a  wonderful, creative, fun group of people. I&rsquo;m not sure yet the exact form my  new dream is taking but I know it involves a shift out of the corporate role  and back to my practices as both a coach and psychotherapist. I&rsquo;ve loved  connecting with you through this newsletter each month and look forward to  staying in touch through the Co-Active Network and the coaching community. Keep  dreaming!</p>

      <p class="subject" style="margin: 18 0 0 0">Revitalize Your Coaching Skills in 2006! 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">It’s always good to plug back in to the original current from time to time to charge up your coaching skills. CTI offers a great way to do that during 2006—and straight from the source no less! “Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching” was created by one of our founders, Henry Kimsey-House, and his partner in play, Gwen Gordon. Both highly skilled coaches, their partnership is particularly apropos for the course content, as Henry has a long-standing history in the acting profession, and Gwen currently teaches play, both at the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology and at Holy Names University. The three-day course was created especially for the coach who has been certified and is looking to go from being a great coach to being a masterful one. 
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Think of  coaching at its best. You're in an intimate dance with your client, your timing  is perfect, creativity sparks, and insight flows effortlessly. A sense of joy,  delight and ease pervades the session, as you both come more and more fully  alive. Masterful coaching is pure intoxicating play. This workshop is for  coaches who want to tap into the joyful power of play in their lives and  practices. It is designed to provide you with the basic theory and skills  needed to liberate the play inherent within you, your clients, and in any  situation.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In this  course, you will learn to:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Bring your whole being into       your coaching.</li>
        <li>Hear and respond to the deepest       (often unspoken) need in the moment.</li>
        <li>Get centered so that you are       completely present for your client.</li>
        <li>Provide the support that makes       play possible.</li>
        <li>Instigate play when it is       absent.</li>
        <li>Play with the obstacles to       play.</li>
        <li>Evolve your own life through       play.</li>
        <li>Widen and deepen your       playground so that everything can become playable.</li>
      </ul>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">&ldquo;The ah-ha&rsquo;s  I got were immense, and the growth and learning about play was invaluable. This  course should be mandatory for all coaches!&rdquo; says Marilyn Ryemon, CPCC, who  participated in the pilot run of the program. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 15 0">&ldquo;Come  Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching&rdquo; will only be offered twice this year, so be  sure to sign up now to assure your place. The course will be offered on both  coasts in 2006&mdash;in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area from April   21-22, 2006,  and in the San Francisco Metropolitan Area on September 22-23,   2006. The  rate is $695 for those who register before February 15 for the Washington, D.C., course, and by July 28 for the San Francisco course. The full fee is $895. You  must either be a CPCC or currently enrolled in Certification at The Coaches Training  Institute, or you must be an ACC, PCC or MCC, certified through the  International Coach Federation, to be eligible for the course. To register,  call The Coaches Training Institute at 1-800-691-6008. Come out and play! </p>

          <p style="margin: 18 0 0 0"><b>Assessing the Team as a System and How  to Assess the Assessments</b><br>
  &ldquo;Coaching a  team is different than coaching individuals, and the difference goes well  beyond the added complexity of numbers,&rdquo; writes <b>Phil Sandahl, CPCC, MCC</b>, co-author of the <i>Co-Active Coaching</i> book and a senior faculty member for CTI. &ldquo;The  coach is working with a dynamic system with a life of its own that is greater  than the working of the individual parts. This systems approach is at the heart  of CTI&rsquo;s Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching curriculum, and the  Stellar Team Diagnostic is built on an ORSC foundation. The theoretical  background and interventions from ORSC are complemented by a practical team  performance model, assessment tool and development support from Team  Diagnostic. The two team resources are an ideal, synergistic match.&rdquo; Read more  about assessing teams <b>here</b>. Phil has  also written a very useful article on assessing the assessments themselves,  which can be very useful when deciding which tools are most appropriate for  your clients. Read more <b>here</b>.</p>
           <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Assessments and Coaching: Using the  MBTI&trade; in Coaching</b><br>
  &ldquo;I've been  utilizing personality type models for more than a decade for personal growth  and relationship counseling. Luckily, I was taught from the beginning to adopt  a &lsquo;coach approach&rsquo; when working with instrument results, and my CTI training  amplified my effectiveness. Since then, I have evolved a &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; approach to  coaching. I begin by guiding my clients through a Self Discovery Process&reg;  and allow that to naturally lead us deeper into the coaching relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vicky Jo Varner, otherwise known as &ldquo;The Type  Fairy,&rdquo; writes <b>here</b> about the  different kinds of assessments she uses with clients, and also writes  specifically about the Myers Briggs Personality Type Indicator in a <b>separate article</b>. She is qualified and  certified to use the Myers Briggs Type Indicator&trade; and the  Interstrength Methodology, and uses various other tools for self-discovery in  her coaching practice.</p>
          <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Assessments: Tools for Developing  Leaders</b><br>
              <b>Hal Hendrix, CPCC</b>, combines 30 years of experience in  the corporate world with coaching and psychology to create a unique and  effective business advisory practice. <b>In  this article,</b> Hal says, &ldquo;The cornerstone of my practice as an  executive/corporate coach is the development of leaders at all levels within  organizations. While the key to success is the relationship I build with the  client, I use assessment tools extensively. People are meant to be led, not  managed. Therefore, the focus is on leadership behavior and the impact that  this behavior has on others.&rdquo;</p>
           <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Play to Their Strengths</b><br>
  &ldquo;The  StrengthsFinder&reg; presented in <i>Now,  Discover Your Strengths,</i> by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton, is the  instrument I use for helping clients assess their strengths. StrengthsFinder is  rich and deep and helps create a language around strengths not replicated in  the few other instruments that exist. I&rsquo;ve used the StrengthsFinder for three  years and still marvel at the deep acknowledgement clients give themselves when  they understand their strengths as innate, unique and intriguing gifts. Even  clients who believe they know their strengths are surprised to discover they actually  know the behaviors they excel at&mdash;not the underlying strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; <b>Andrea  Sigetich,</b> <b>MCC, CPCC,</b> is a  corporate escapee who has been coaching organizational leaders since 1997. <b>In this article,</b> she shares her insight  about an assessment tool that she has found very valuable in her coaching  practice. </p>
          <p style="margin: 10 0 15 0"><b>Assessments: Stereotyping or  Self-Discovering?</b><br>
              <b>Mary Jo Hazard, MS, CPCC, PCC,</b> has been using assessments in her  life and her work since the mid 1980s and is a huge advocate of them and their  value in coaching. <b>This article</b> describes her four preferred assessments and their benefits: &ldquo;Some naysayers  dismiss the value of assessments: &lsquo;No one&rsquo;s gonna stereotype me!&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m  unique, how can they put me in a box with a bunch of letters to describe me?&rsquo; I  see them as a way to better understand ourselves so we can learn to live and  work with others whose preferences may be very different from our own. Once we  see more clearly, we can choose how to be proactive and how to respond to life.  It&rsquo;s all about awareness and choice.&rdquo;</p>          <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><i><a name="celebration"></a></i>          </TD>
