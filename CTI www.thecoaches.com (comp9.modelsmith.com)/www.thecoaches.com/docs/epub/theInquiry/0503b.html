      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Spring is beginning its annual flirtation with us. You know, that time of year when spring peeks around the corner, smiling, then ducks back into hiding. One day the sun is shining, jackets come off and trees begin to bud; the next day, it’s back to winter. The flirtatious spring game to keep us on our toes.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Play is on my mind this month as we announce the latest addition to our coursework.  “Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching” was greeted with rave reviews during the pilot offerings last year. We’re thrilled now to have it as part of the CTI curriculum. Read more about it under <strong><a class=orange href="#cti-news">CTI News</a></strong>.</td>

  	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px"> Our topic for <a class=orange href="#articles">articles</a> this month is “Coaching and Therapy.” As a coach and therapist myself, I always find this a fascinating topic: Where does one end and the other begin? When do coach and therapist work together? How does a coach know when to refer? We have three wonderful articles this month that approach this topic from different perspectives. Diane Petrella, MSW, an experienced therapist and beginning coach, shares her thoughts on the overlap between coaching and therapy. Jeff Kaplan, PhD, CPCC, takes a look at best practices for assuring that you’re coaching and not slipping unknowingly into therapy. Lastly, Phyllis and Rachel Shanker, a mother-daughter therapist-coach team, share their perspective on the differences between the coaching and therapy. Enjoy! 
  	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Also, join us in celebrating our newest CPCCs. And, check out the topics for the next few months. Think about sharing your wisdom, experience and insights with our community by submitting an article for a future edition of <em>The Inquiry</em>.

	 We are excited to announce the latest addition to our course roster, “Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching.” This course was created by one of our founders, Henry Kimsey House, and his partner in play, Gwen Gordon. Both highly skilled coaches, their partnership is particularly apropos for the course content, as Henry has a long-standing history in the acting profession, and Gwen currently teaches play both at the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology and at the California Institute of Integral Studies. The three-day course was created especially for the coach who has been certified and is looking to go from being a great coach to being a masterful one.       
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">       <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/images/4574.gif" width="150" height="99" align="right" class="border2">Think of coaching at its best. You're in an intimate dance with your client, your timing is perfect, creativity sparks, and insight flows effortlessly. A sense of joy, delight and ease pervades the session, as you both come more and more fully alive. Masterful coaching is pure intoxicating play. This workshop is for coaches who want to tap into the joyful power of play in their lives and practices. “The ah-ha’s I got were immense, and the growth and learning about play was invaluable. This course should be mandatory for all coaches!” says Marilyn Ryemon, CPCC, who participated in the pilot run of the program.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">“Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching” will be offered in two locations for 2005—in Minneapolis from June 3-5, 2005, and in the San Francisco Metropolitan Area on November 4-6, 2005, just one week before the ICF conference hosted in San Jose, CA.  There is a rate of $695 for those who register before April 15 for the Minneapolis course, and by August 31 for the San Francisco course. The full fee is $895. You must either be a CPCC or currently enrolled in Certification at The Coaches Training Institute, or you must be an ACC, PCC or MCC, certified through the International Coach Federation, to be eligible for the course. To register, call The Coaches Training Institute at 1-800-691-6008. Come out and play!

      <P style="MARGIN: 0px"><strong> Diane Petrella</strong>, MSW, is a CPCC candidate who recently completed CTI&rsquo;s certification program. She has a combined coaching and psychotherapy practice and has an interest in bridging the healing aspects of psychotherapy with the forward moving momentum of life coaching. She says, &ldquo;As a beginning coach and very experienced psychotherapist, I am intrigued by ongoing discussions about the differences between coaching and therapy. Much attention focuses on the apparent differences but there has been little discussion on the similarities. This article addresses, in my opinion, the many ways in which the two professions overlap.&rdquo; For further information, <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/similarities.html" target="_blank">read the article</a>.

	  <BR>“You’re in the middle of your third session with a new client, when he shares about his history of depression over the last 10 years. He goes through periods of withdrawing from others, sleep disturbance and feelings of deep sadness. During these periods, he feels hopeless and helpless. You learn that he had been slipping into one of these periods shortly before hiring you as a coach. Although he continues to slip into a state of depression, your energy, support, enthusiasm and genuine interest in him has been invaluable. He has been inching forward in meeting his goals, showing up on time, and is benefiting from the relationship. He comments that he has made more progress with you than with any number of therapists he’s seen in the past. Have you unknowingly been doing therapy with this client? Does this client need therapy instead of coaching? What should you do next?” <strong>Jeff Kaplan</strong>, PhD, is a certified Co-Active coach, licensed psychologist, author and trainer who has worked with clients in both the therapeutic and coaching arenas. <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/insidelook.html" target="_blank">Read his article</a>

        <br>
        <strong>Phyliss Shanken</strong>, MA, and <strong>Rachel Shanken </strong>enjoy a unique relationship. Not only do they share a common bond as mother and daughter, but they also work together with clients as therapist and coach. They’ve collaborated equally once again in the co-creation of this article, and bestow their wisdom upon us about the places where therapy and coaching differ, as learned through the experience of working with clients. They offer this: “Coaches and psychotherapists are change agents, yet each discipline has a different philosophy and approach. For mental health, counseling and coaching professionals, learning about and appreciating distinctions between the two fields facilitates a better result for client or patient.” <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/collaboration.html" target="_blank">Read the article</a>
