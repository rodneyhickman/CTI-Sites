      <strong>Announcing New CTI Faculty Members</strong> <br>
If you’ve been in a CTI course, you’ve met some of our faculty members who lead our in-person courses. In addition to these awesome “front-of-the-room” leaders, we have other faculty members who support the learning in our certification program. Certification Program Leaders (CPLs) lead the certification teleclasses, supervisors support certification program students with individual supervision sessions, and examiners conduct the certification exams that determine who receives the designation CPCC. 
 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">        Over the past few months, we’ve held auditions and begun training new front-of-the-room leaders (both in Europe and in North America), CPLs and supervisors. We’re thrilled to welcome these awesome leaders to their new roles. Some of them are joining the CTI faculty for the first time and others are taking on new roles in addition to previous ones.

      <P style="MARGIN: 0px"><B>The Power of Certification</B><br>
     After questioning several coaches on their own experiences, I became curious about the direction of the profession at large. Will certification become mandatory at some point?  Pat Williams sits on the regulatory committee for ICF, and he and the rest of the committee are currently grappling with this issue. “Government agencies and many corporations require coaches to be licensed before they will hire them.”  
Iola Freeland, CPCC, covers these greater questions along with sharing her own experience in this insightful article.

      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px"><B>Certification—Why Bother?</B>

	  <br> Becoming certified as a Co-Active coach is a big choice. It is a choice because at this point, no specific coach training, much less certification, is needed to coach and work with clients. It is a big choice because doing certification takes a lot of time, money and energy, all of which are very big things to most of us. What is so important about a program that is not technically required and is such a big commitment? In other words, why bother? You bother because you want to be a really good coach. Sandi Davis, CPCC and CTI leader, has some very inspiring and motivating advice to share in her article about becoming certified. Read more by clicking  <span class="style1"><a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Davis.html" target="_blank">here. </a></span>

        <br>
        <strong>Carol Ross, CPCC</strong>, was certified through CTI last year. She writes a wonderful reflection on what her journey was like, giving us the honest ins and outs of her process:  Last year, I flew from Denver to San Francisco to take my coaching certification exam. While the focus and worry for my classmates had been on the oral exam—coaching live in front of experienced coaching instructors—I was more concerned with making arrangements to see friends and family in the Bay Area. Instead of wondering if I would be able to ask the right powerful question during the oral exam, I was figuring out how to get to four different suburbs without a car…. To follow her journey further,  <span class="style1"><a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Rossarticle.html" target="_blank">read the article.</a></span>
