	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Dear Co-Active Coaches,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Congratulations to everyone who participated October 3rd in the CALL-to-Action Marathon in Portland, OR! This marathon was organized to bring coaches and leaders together to raise money and awareness for CTI scholarships, the Time to Change prison project and other leadership projects. Every one of the 16 walkers and runners crossed the finish line and while CTI co-founder Laura Whitworth wasn't able to participate in the actual marathon due to health problems, she was an active participant in the fund-raising and was right there at the race cheering them on. We're looking forward to seeing pictures of their beaming faces and hearing more about the experience once they've had a chance to rest their weary muscles a bit. Again, congratulations. Your commitment to spreading Co-Activity is an inspiration to us all.

  	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Crisp days, falling leaves and homecoming (an October tradition in my hometown) have always been what comes to mind for me as I think about October. This year, I'm adding a flurry of pre-conference busy-ness to that October definition. The ICF's 9th Annual International Conference is just a few weeks away and we're fully in the midst of getting ready. Read about what we're planning in CTI News.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Our topic this month is coaching as a catalyst for learning about one's self, and our articles include contributions from Grace Flannery, CPCC; Judith Duhl, CPCC; and Melissa Rosati. Take a few moments for a delightful read.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Also in this issue, join us in celebrating our newest CPCCs. And check out the topics for future issues and think about sharing your insight with your fellow coaches by submitting an article.

	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><b>ICF 2004 Conference, November 4-6, Quebec City, Canada</b><br>In just a few weeks, more than 1,000 coaches from around the world will be gathering in beautiful Quebec City for the 9th Annual International Conference of the International Coach Federation. The title for this year's conference is "Global Forum for the Art and Science of Coaching." Here are some of the things CTI has planned for this year's conference.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0410/pic2.jpg" width="300" height="198" border="0" align="right" alt="" hspace="10">We are sponsoring a special breakfast event Friday morning, November 5, entitled <b>"Coaching the Voice of the System."</b> This interactive, 60-minute session will be led by the founders of CTI's advanced training program in Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching, Faith Fuller, PhD, CPCC, and Marita Fridjhon, MSW, CPCC, PCC.  In this session, participants will discover the powerful impact of viewing the system as client and coaching the voice of the system.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Then, Friday evening, CTI is inviting our community and friends to a <b>Dessert Extravaganza</b>. Come join CTI founders, leaders and staff for a night of deliciousness and fun! There will be a brief introduction of CTI folks and our Co-Active Network community organizers, leaving plenty of time for socializing and laughter. Come visit with old friends and make new ones. Relax, socialize, enjoy!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The conference this year, as always, has dozens of exciting breakout sessions scheduled and we're thrilled that many of them are being led by members of our community. CTI co-founder, Karen Kimsey-House, and CTI President and CEO, Shirzad Chamine, are on the schedule, as are CTI leaders, Elaine Jaynes, Marita Fridjhon, Faith Fuller, and several other CPCCs and CTI students. We'll have a schedule at the CTI booth listing the sessions led by members of our community. If you're at the conference, come by and pick one up.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We also have some fun gifts and special offers for conference attendees, and special items for CTI coaches and Co-Active Network community organizers and members. Come on by and say "Hi!"
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you won't be attending the conference this year, we want to share the excitement and learning with you also. Our Co-Active Network main community organizers, Paul Sherman and Andrew Gabel, will be sharing highlights from the conference each day. Look for their messages (and some photos, we hope) on the Co-Active Network during the conference. If you're not already a member of the Co-Active Network, take a minute and sign up. It's free, and it's a great way to stay in touch with the community.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">See you in Quebec!

	<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0"><b>Self-Awareness Brings Transformation</b><br>Grace Flannery, CPCC, says, "Quite simply and profoundly, coaching has transformed my life." Today, she is a life coach, relationship coach, leadership trainer and CTI leader. She has a background in the sciences, as well as social justice non-profits. She met her first coach at a non-profit fundraising conference and was struck by the powerful question on his brochure: "You work for a non-profit because you want to change the world…well, are you?" <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0410/pic3.jpg" width="300" height="198" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="" vspace="10">Her answer was "NO!" and this led to the painful awareness that her dreams and goals seemed to have slipped through her fingers. Grace shares how that painful moment was the first step on a journey of transformation. <a class="orange" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/selfawareness.html" target="blank">Read the article</a>.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>The Beat Goes On</b><br>Melissa Rosati describes her biggest challenge as enjoying the present and relinquishing the analytical chokehold she places on unfamiliar situations.  This homogenous approach thrives in command-and-control corporate structures. It is stifling and unsustainable as a life approach. While she knew this from being coached, she didn't put the pieces together completely until she started coach training.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Since then, she has stopped predicting conversations and started practicing powerful questions of seven words or less. She is learning to belly dance as a beautiful daily reminder of life's rhythms. And she includes finger cymbals as a topic teaser in her coaching welcome packs. ("What's the rhythm in this organization today?") Neither she, nor the boardroom, will ever be the same! <a class="orange" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/thebeatgoeson.html" target="blank">Read the article</a>.

The Co-Active Coaching model holds the fundamental premise that we are creative, resourceful and whole. And never more so, she adds, than when we are avoiding commitment to our dreams.
