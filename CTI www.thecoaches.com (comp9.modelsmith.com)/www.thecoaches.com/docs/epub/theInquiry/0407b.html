	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">If you are a coach who has been the CEO of a Fortune 1000 company or have experience coaching a CEO of a Fortune 1000 company, we have an opportunity that might interest you. Read more about it in CTI News.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">In the April 2004 ICF <i>Coaching World</i> newsletter, Dan Martinage, ICF Executive Director, referred to regulation as "one of the profession's most important and challenging issues." Some states have seen coaching as a part of the mental health field and, as such, have required coaches to register as "unlicensed counselors" or "unlicensed psychotherapists." A group of coaches in Colorado joined together to successfully fight this regulation in their state. Read their letter of announcement and thanks in CTI News.

	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Coaches who would like their names passed on to this third-party organization should contact <a class="blue" href="mailto:paul@thecoaches.com">Paul Sherman</a> at CTI by Thursday, July 22, 2004. Please include a resume and/or detailed biography.

	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><b>Coaching Legislation in Colorado</b><br>Dear Friends and Colleagues:
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><i>Colorado Legislature Exempts Coaches from Mental Health Registration Requirements</i>
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">The Colorado Coalition of Coaches is pleased to announce that the Colorado General Assembly passed legislation that exempts professional coaches from having to register as "unlicensed psychotherapists" under the state's mental health statutes. The bill was signed into law by Governor Bill Owens on May 21, 2004. Specifically, the language proposed by the Colorado Coalition of Coaches and incorporated into Colorado's new mental health statutes reads:
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><i>"The provisions of this article shall not apply to professional coaches who have had coach-specific training and who serve clients exclusively in the capacity of coaches."</i>
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">The Colorado Coalition of Coaches (C3) is a group of 12 coaches representing all coaches in Colorado, including coaches belonging to these organizations: Denver Coach Federation, Boulder Coaches Alliance, Northern Colorado Coaches Alliance, International Coach Federation, International Association of Coaches and Worldwide Association of Business Coaches.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">We gratefully acknowledge the generous donations of more than 200 coaches and coaching organizations throughout the United States and internationally who supported this legislative initiative. Additionally, we would like to recognize the financial support of the International Coach Federation, the Worldwide Association of Business Coaches and especially Coachville, without whose help this effort wouldn't have been possible. We also gratefully acknowledge the assistance of all the coaches in Colorado who called and wrote their legislators to secure support for the legislation. Without the support of these coaches and coaching organizations, we could not have mounted this 17-month initiative. Finally, we would like to thank Ron Smith, our talented lobbyist, for his guidance and assistance throughout the process.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">We understand that the coaching profession in other states and internationally may be confronted with statutory mandates or regulatory interpretation that might require coaches to register as unlicensed psychotherapists, or otherwise be regulated under mental health statutes similar to Colorado's. If any coach or professional coaching association wishes to learn more about our experience in Colorado, please feel free to contact any one of us on the C3 team (listed below), or visit our website at <a class="blue" href="http://www.coloradocoaches.com" target="blank">www.coloradocoaches.com</a>.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Again, our heartfelt thanks for your assistance and support.

TC Waisman, CPCC, takes a look at how applying the principles of co-active coaching is related to successful leadership in the organizational culture.  <a class="blue" href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/coactivityleadership.html" target="blank">Read the article</a>.
