      <p class="subject" style="margin: 18 0 0 0">CTI Expands Management Team—Letter from the CEO
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">I am  delighted to make two major announcements regarding the expansion of our  management team. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As CTI&rsquo;s  business has grown in complexity and size, I have become increasingly aware  that it is no longer possible for one person to adequately play both the  President and CEO roles. I have asked Karen Kimsey-House, CTI&rsquo;s co-founder, to  step into the role of CTI president, focused on the internal and day-to-day  functioning of the company. This frees me up to focus more on the external  challenges of the company, especially in the areas of high-level strategy,  messaging, communication and key client relations. Karen has stepped into the  president&rsquo;s role as of the beginning of the year and has already made a big  difference. I have worked with Karen in various functions and capacities for  close to four years and have learned more about leadership from her than any  other person or institution in my past. Our partnership is strong, very  complementary and, of course, Co-Active. It bodes well for the future of our  great company and our impact in the world. </p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In an  increasing commitment to support the spread of Co-Activity globally, I am also  excited to announce that we have hired a new Director of CTI's International  Business, Lori Shook. Lori will have a wide range of responsibilities, from managing  and supporting relationships with CTI&rsquo;s international partners to creating  strategy for further international expansion, including diversifying and  expanding the language capability of our leader body. Lori is not new to this  path; for the past two years, she has been tirelessly spearheading our  international expansion, along with her indefatigable comrade Jim Patterson.  Jim and Lori have moved mountains in the past two years, and Jim will continue  to support Lori in this important work. Lori is an MCC and&nbsp;has been an  active CTI leader and coach for more than seven years. Lori travels extensively  to lead courses and meet with business partners. She lives in France. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Please join  me in welcoming Karen and Lori into their expanded roles at CTI. We are off to  a great start in 2006 to build increased organizational capacity to fulfill our  great promise in the world. </p>
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">With  respect and gratitude,<br>
        Shirzad  Chamine, CEO</p>

She only recently made her way out to California and has now landed at The Coaches Training Institute. We’re glad she did. This office just would not be the same without Barb’s unique blend of irreverence, wit, and her unique ability to “call it like it is” and get away with it. (This is probably due to her genuinely warm eyes and whole-hearted smile.)

Together, they&rsquo;ll explore how to unleash  the pure joy, creativity and spontaneous brilliance of unbridled free play in  your coaching. Developing mastery has never been this much fun!

          <p><b>Magic From the Mess: Discovering the Power of Roles in Teams</b><br>
        We&rsquo;ve all been there&mdash;on teams,  committees or groups that just aren&rsquo;t getting along. Whether on a functional  team within in a corporation or on a committee in a volunteer organization, we  know how painful and messy it can get sometimes. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that  way. Relationship systems coaching can be a powerful means to help teams make  magic from their messes and transform the way they work together. <b>Diane Boivie, CPCC, ACC</b>, of Radiant  Life Coaching, shows us just one way to take a step back and look at what&rsquo;s  really going on&mdash;from the perspective of roles within the system. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Boivie.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read the article.</a></b></p>

Denzil is  also a founding board member of Applied Improvisation Network, a business  community exploring performance-based human development and innovation.

&ldquo;As a  relationship coach, I love helping people choose who they want to &ldquo;be&rdquo; within  the family context and how they want to impact it as a result. Whether the coaching  is with one member of the family or everyone, the effect is powerful. Families  get excited and nervous about being able to design their relationship with  other family members.&rdquo;<b> Susan T. Howson, MA, CPCC, CHBC, </b>is  a family and relationship systems coach, human development expert, university  professor, author, keynote speaker and humanitarian-award winner. <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Howson.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Here</a></b> she writes about using the  constellation work learned in the Organization and Relationship Systems  Coaching courses to coach the family as a system.</p>

          <b>Alfred DePew, MA, CPCC, PCC</b>, coaches individuals, couples and  organizations that are up to big, rascally things in the world. He is the  author of <i>Wild &amp; Woolly: A Journal  Keeper&rsquo;s Handbook</i>. He has written two articles for <i>The Inquiry</i> this month on the topic of the relationship between two  people. The first explores how our perspectives on money can influence our  romantic relationships <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/DePew2.html" target="_blank" class="orange">click here</a></b>,  and the second <b><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/DePew.html" target="_blank" class="orange">click here</a></b>, is  about coaching gay couples and how these relationships may have different  concerns than heterosexual relationships. Join Alfred for some entertaining and  insightful reading!</p>
          <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Conflict, Emotional Hijacking &amp;  Healing in Couples Work</b><br>
&ldquo;In my work  with couples, I find that one of the central places that people repeatedly get  stuck in their dance together usually has at least one&mdash;if not both&mdash;partners,  caught in the grip of an emotional hijacking,&rdquo; writes <b>Vivienne Simon, JD,  CPCC</b>, and relationship coach. &ldquo;Emotional  hijacking, also described as &lsquo;being triggered,&rsquo; describes a distressing  experience in which an internal switch flips and, in an instant, a person is no  longer in control of his/her emotional response to the other person. In this  state, authentic communication is no longer possible.&rdquo; She loves helping motivated, growth-oriented couples find peace in  themselves and joy in their relationships.

          <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Letting Go is Not Failure</b><br>
&ldquo;Letting go  is not failing. Failing to let go can be deadly. Whether it is with  relationships, dreams, old identities or old ways of being and doing  things&mdash;these will need to be released so that new ones have room to flourish.  Our own personal dreams may need to be morphed in order for the relationship  dream to have room to grow. We might assume we need to let go of each other,  when it may be that we need to let go of some aspect of ourselves: our personal  and inflexible agendas. How willing are we to be changed by our relationships?&rdquo; <b>Kathy Loh, MA, CPCC</b>, is a graduate  of the ORSC training, a certified print coach and a member of the Antares  leadership tribe with whom she will attend R5 this spring. She co-leads the  Creative Artists niche on the CTI Co-Active Network and is a musician and  writer.
