      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">As always, Spring draws our thoughts to growth and new possibilities through budding trees and blossoming flowers. Here at CTI, we are seeing growth and possibility in new coaches, new courses and new leaders. In February, we announced new leaders who have joined us in Europe, and in early April, we completed North American leader auditions. We’ll be announcing those results soon. In March, we announced the newest addition to our course offerings: Come Alive! The Artful Play of Coaching. Each month, we’re thrilled to see new faces beginning the coaching journey in our courses and to welcome new CPCCs as they complete Certification.

      <strong>Co-Active Leadership Program in Europe</strong><br> 
      We’re very excited to announce that CTI’s Co-Active Leadership Program is coming to Europe. While many Europeans have been among the nearly 1,000 people who have participated in this program in Northern California, many have been asking when it would be available in Europe. The answer is very soon!

      <P style="MARGIN: 0px"><B>Emotional Intelligence and Coaching:  A Winning Combination</B><br>
      The concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) is based on the work of David C. McClelland, a psychology professor at Harvard in the early 1970s. He was first to challenge the generalized use of IQ tests as indicating anything more than a person’s abilities to take tests. He instead recommended finding an approach that measured “experience, wisdom and ability to perform effectively on various tasks that life presents.” To find out more about what <strong>Jay Orlin</strong>, executive coach, says about using EI to coach both business accounts and clients, <span class="style1"><a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Orlin.html" target="_blank">read the article</a></span><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Orlin.html">.</a>

	  <BR>
	  <em>Coach: Good morning Mark…</em>
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px"><em>Mark (a pause and an intake of breath on the other end of the phone line): I am so angry coach. I am angry at you…angry at myself. Don’t ask me any more questions!  I don’t think that is what I need…. </em>
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Most of the time our clients are glad to get on the line with us. But every so often one goes ballistic. In this article, <strong>Marla Skibbins CPCC, MCC</strong>, shows us how an understanding of Emotional Intelligence can save us when we get in very tight places with our clients. <span class="style1"><a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Skibbins.html" target="_blank">Read more! </a></span>

        <br>
        A woman recently called 911 from the drive-through at a Burger King. She wanted the 911 operator to send down an officer to force Burger King to make her Western BBQ Burger correctly. The 911 operator told her to act like an adult and calmly and rationally work this out with the manager. The operator refused to send down an officer and the woman demanded that the police come there to “protect her.” The operator replied, “From what? The wrong hamburger? A harmful hamburger?”
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">As coaches, we know the woman wasn’t really angry about the hamburger. There are probably a lot of places we could have coached her—or could we have helped in this situation?
