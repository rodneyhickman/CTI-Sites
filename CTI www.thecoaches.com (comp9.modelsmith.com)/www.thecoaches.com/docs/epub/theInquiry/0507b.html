	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">	Summer has arrived. Here in our little corner of Northern California, that means foggy cool mornings, warm sunny afternoons, and cool clear evenings. Top it off with the beautiful views from our new 5th floor office and… Ahhh! Hope your version of summer is delightful, too.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Each week, those of us who work at the CTI office spend the first part of our all-staff meeting reading and discussing our <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/what-we-believe/values.html" target="_blank" class="orange">values</a>. We typically pick one of our values and spend the week with an inquiry about that value. This week, we’re looking at the topic of “curiosity.” While it’s not specifically on our list of values, you’ll recognize it as one of the five contexts of the Co-Active model, and curiosity certainly plays a part in many (perhaps all?) of our values. If you’d like, join us in these inquiries: How does my curiosity show up? When am I truly being curious and when am I just gathering data?

    <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Curiosity also seems the perfect doorway into this month’s newsletter topic: diversity.

And in the community of people being coached? Our diverse and creative community responded with an abundance of articles that we’re excited to share with you. Veronica Conway, Judy Tso, Patricia St. Onge and Virginia Kellogg, Erin Yoshimura, and Edie Ilan each bring their own perspective and experience to the topic. Settle in for a fascinating and thought-provoking read.

      <strong>CTI Announces New Course—Vision Story™: Destiny by Design</strong> <br>
      On June 29, we announced our newest course, Vision Story™: Destiny by Design, and we’re thrilled that the August 27-28 pilot was full to capacity within 48 hours.

It is sure to change your life by beginning at the beginning and asking the crucial questions you may be neglecting to ask yourself.
      <ul>
        <li>“What is next for my life and how can I consciously create what I want?” </li>
        <li>"What do I need to leave behind in order to do that?” </li>
        <li>“What is the story that I tell about myself to others?”            </li>
        <li>	“What is the story that I want to tell?”</li>
      </ul>

       “I think of diversity as summoning rainbows—as painting rainbows. What do you need to do when you are going to paint a rainbow? Why, you go and get all the colors. You collect them, assemble them and then you begin painting. Sometimes you paint each color individually, and sometimes you blend them. Red and blue, blended together, create a completely new color, a new experience. Have you ever been inspired by the color purple?” <strong>Veronica Conway, CPCC</strong>, is the publisher, creator and a co-author of the book <em>The African American Guide to Personal and Business Success</em>. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/paintingrainbows.html" target="_blank" class="orange">In this article</a>, she speaks about her experience of bringing coaching to African Americans in the business sector.

      <strong>Judy Tso, MAA</strong>, is one of the nation’s leading social scientists, offering an array of diversity consulting to clients such as the USDA, Emerson College, and Bic. Here she offers some insightful suggestions for increasing diversity within the coaching field: “We must plan for the long term, keeping in mind that with some groups, it will take more time to build up coaching as a service that people are willing to pay for, that they consider valuable. Each coaching organization needs a diversity initiative.…”<a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Tso.html" target="_blank" class="orange">  Read the article.

        <br>
       “As often happens, the call for coaching assistance came when an organizational leader, Alice, was at her wits end. Alice was the director of a public housing and community development agency with a staff of 28. A Japanese American, she had 23 years experience in a different jurisdiction. Her staff was made up largely of two groups. An older “civil servant” crowd was mostly white, many within three or four years of retirement. The other cluster was young “activists,” many of them people of color recruited from social change organizations.” To see what unfolds for Alice, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/culturematters.html" target="_blank" class="orange">read the article</a>       
       that was co-written by <strong>Patricia St. Onge</strong> and CTI course leader <strong>Virginia Kellogg, MCC, CPCC.</strong>      
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 15px"><strong>Increasing Awareness About Diversity Within the Coaching Profession—Making the Unseen Seen</strong> <br>
        <strong>Erin Yoshimura, CPCC</strong>, is the Chief Empowerment Officer of Empowerful Changes. She offers us her wisdom in this article: “In the movie,<em> What the Bleep Do We Know?</em>, the Native Americans in the Caribbean couldn’t see Columbus’ ships because they had no concept of a ship. Only the Shaman noticed the waves coming off of the water and wondered what caused them. After staring out to the sea for several days in contemplation and wonder, he finally saw the ships. Diversity is like that—we only see what we know, and we must constantly stare out into the sea of what we don’t know.” <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/unseenseen.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read more.</a><P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 15px"><strong>Diversity in Coaching—Everyone Benefits</strong><br>
       “Just imagine a world in which we embrace and celebrate differences rather than get embarrassed by them. Let’s bring this down to a very practical level. Americans generally value following the rules and being honest, Israelis generally value creativity. This is why when you enter a parking lot in the United States, you see cars parked between the lines and in a parking lot in Israel, cars relate to the lines as a “suggestion.” Do you view someone as wrong in this situation, or just different?” <strong>Edie Ilan</strong>, MA Cross Cultural Communication, MA Public Administration, moved to Israel from Columbus, OH, in 1994. <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/Ilan.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Read the article</a>
