      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re excited to let you know that CTI’s Business Development Program (BDP) is back and better than ever! CTI is now in partnership with The Business Catalyst Institute, founded by Leslie Lupinsky, CPC, MCC, and Dorcas Kelley, CPCC, CMC, ACC. We are thrilled to be working with these two highly respected professionals in the creation and implementation of the new program. Their Business Catalyst courses in the earlier BDP program were very popular, and students reported many successes. Together, we have developed a whole new program design that we feel will be more in synch with the preferences and needs of coaches who want to build a firm foundation for their coaching business and/or get themselves fired up for expansion and growth.
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0512/puzzle.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" align="right">What is different about the new BDP Program? </b>It is now a modularized and personalized program that allows you to take classes

       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">         <img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0512/ace.gif" alt="ACE" width="150" height="92" hspace="10" align="right">We are extremely proud to announce that CTI has become the first coach training organization to receive college credit recommendations from the nationally recognized American Council on Education. As the result of a review conducted on July 26, 2005, by ACE’s College Credit Recommendation Service, CTI’s core Co-Active Coaching curriculum, Certification Program and Co-Active Leadership Program have been recommended for college credit. A team of content specialists, selected from college faculty, has reported that CTI’s courses are comparable to college-level courses and may be used as transfer credit at many colleges and universities nationwide.         </p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In receiving ACE’s credit recommendation, The Coaches Training Institute joins a select number of organizations—including the American Management Association, AT&T, Dale Carnegie & Associates, Citigroup, Delta Air Lines, Learning Tree International, McDonalds Corporation, Union Pacific Railroad and UAW-GM—that offer ACE college credit-recommended courses.         </p>
       <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">ACE credit-recommended courses motivate learners to begin, continue or complete a college degree program. According to a recent U.S. Department of Education Study, more than 40 percent of American adults take part in some type of adult learning activity each year—the vast majority for work-related reasons or because they want to earn an academic credential. In addition to the potential for college credit, many employers use ACE’s credit recommendations in determining which training programs qualify for employee tuition reimbursement.         </p>

&ldquo;Futurists  tell us that networks, collaboration and wildly sharing information and ideas  will be the hallmark of successful businesses of the next century.

&ldquo;For me,  building the foundations of service started at a young age. Those foundations  came through in childhood friendships and have found a life of their own  through me.

          &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a  good reminder for us all as we try to balance our coaching businesses with the  business of community service. How, when, where should we give of ourselves  without the thought of financial compensation? When should we follow the  immortal words of the great Ralph Waldo Emerson, who once said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s one of  the most beautiful compensations of life: No man or woman can sincerely try to  help another, without helping themselves; serve and thou shall be served.&rsquo; A  recent Colorado snowstorm reminded me of one possible answer to what can be a  challenging question as we try and balance life.&rdquo; So writes <b>Mark McIntosh,</b> founder and president<b> </b>of<b> </b>Victory Productions, a company that encourages others to remember they&rsquo;re  limited only by imagination, and not fear, in creating productive choices to  life&rsquo;s personal and professional challenges.

Recently, I have spent more time in community service than I  have working with paying clients. The pro bono coaching I have done has been  with executive directors of non-profit organizations and with criminal  offenders.
