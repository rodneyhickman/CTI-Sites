      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Here’s what’s happening in CTI-land. This year is shaping up to be a year full of new waves of activity. We continue to grow internationally and recently conducted our first leader auditions in Europe. Growth in the United States, particularly in the corporate sector, is strong and we are getting ready for U.S. leader auditions later this spring. Sabrina Roblin, CTI’s School Director, shares more details in CTI News.	  </td>

  	<P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Our theme this month is “Synchronicity and Your Coaching Business.” In our call for articles, we asked: What synchronistic events have happened that resulted in a turning point in your business? When have “coincidences” pointed your business in a new direction? Four members of our community—Anne Kerr Romberg, CPCC; Catherine “CeCe” Converse, CPCC; Sheila Kelly; and Gary Hirsch—each share their very individual experiences with synchronicity. Grab a cup of tea, sit back and enjoy these delightful views into the world of synchronicity.

	 CTI has just finished a wonderful year in which we expanded both our public and private (inside corporations) offerings of Co-Active Coaching workshops in the United States and internationally. Our work has met huge success inside corporations where there is an increasing awareness of the critical importance of Co-Active Coaching skills for effective management and leadership. We now have Microsoft, The Prudential, Marriott, Wells Fargo, EPA, Fairview Health Services and Capgemini as clients, among others. 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">        In response to the growth CTI is experiencing, CTI held its first front-of-room leader auditions in Europe on January 25 and 26. Not only was this the first leader audition in more than three years, it marked a growth point in the company’s history. It was the beginning of a European-based part of the CTI leader body. The auditions were held in London. Among the 25 who auditioned, 14 countries were represented. It was an intense process that called forth the best in everyone who participated. I flew over to be part of the nine-member audition team. It wasn’t easy to choose only 10 from the group, as they were all exceptional. During the process, I was touched by how the auditionees risked failure over and over again to wow us with their leadership skills and with who they were. I was also touched by how they supported and empowered one another, knowing that they were all competing with each other for only 10 available spots. 
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Our partners from the UK, Norway, Sweden and Spain came to the auditions to support and contribute to the process. It was wonderful to have them there. They have all been putting their heart and a lot of time into growing Co-Active Coaching in Europe, with great results. The European market is growing quickly. It’s their work that helped create the need for European-based leaders.
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">Thank you to all those who applied and auditioned, to Lori Shook and Jim Patterson for the great job they did organizing and leading the auditions, to the nine member audition team, and our partners and staff.  We now have 10 new front of room leaders that I’m very excited about!
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">With the growth we’re seeing in our business in the public and corporate markets, we have also planned and announced an upcoming U.S. leader audition in California on April 5 and 6, and we urge you to apply, if you are interested. 
	  
      <P style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">   You must be available both days. To be invited to the audition, you need to submit an application and meet the following qualifications, among others:       
	  <blockquote>
	    <p style="MARGIN: 10px 0px 0px">• You will have finished leadership by the end of April 4, 2005.<br>
• You will have passed your CPCC exam by April 1, 2005.<br>
• You have a thriving coaching practice (minimum 10 clients).<br>
• You are eligible for an ICF credential, either PCC or MCC.<br>
• You have your primary residence in North America.
	    </p>

Her business <em>Carrot Coach <strong></strong></em>helps people achieve their dreams by reaching for the carrots they most want in their lives. She writes, &ldquo;One warm, sunny October day when I had a few extra minutes at the barn, I went out into the pasture where the six horses I work with were grazing. As I stood in the middle of the pasture, I posed the question&mdash;to myself and so to the horses&mdash;&lsquo;What is next for my business, for this business with horses?&rsquo;&rdquo; To find out what happened next, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/horsesmouth.html" target="_blank" class="orange">read the article</a>.

	  <BR>“Coaching found me. I am a coach largely because of an invitation to join a coaching business. At the time, I had not even heard of coaching outside the sports arena. Who could predict it would connect so completely to my passion and my purpose?”<strong> Sheila Kelly</strong>, has a BA in psychology and a PhD in life. She lives in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, where she maintains her coaching practice.  <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/accidentalcoach.html" target="_blank">Read the article</a>

        <br>
        <strong>Catherine “CeCe” Converse</strong>, CPCC, specializes in soul purpose and intuition coaching. In her musings about the journey into her coaching practice, she says, “Ever experience what we call serendipity, or synchronicity? It looks something like this: You are thinking about your best friend from college and she/he calls; you meet someone new and connect so deeply it changes your life forever. Recently, a good friend registered for a workshop, unsure from where she was going to get the money to pay the balance. A few days later, her sister called and offered the $500 she had won on a layover at the airport in Las Vegas. Serendipity? Synchronicity? Whatever we call these events, they change our lives forever.” For further information, <a class=orange href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/journey.html" target="_blank">read the article</a>.

	    <strong>Gary Hirsch</strong> is president of the Enlightened Business Institute, a management consultant, trainer and professional business coach. Here’s the unlikely story of how that came to be: “In 2002, I ‘discovered’ the Enlightened Business Institute (EBI), the company I now lead. Being the pragmatist that I am, it was an unlikely discovery, though an even more unlikely chain of events occurred prior to it. They began like this: In 2001, a Buddhist monk visited Olympia where I live. With a spiritual path far from my radar screen, I attended the teaching to please my wife. He spoke of anger, ignorance and desire as the three poisons, the three feelings that, unless we are vigilant, can be counted on to ‘poison’ every good thing we encounter in this life. I was hooked.” <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/consulttocoach.html" target="_blank" class=orange>Read the article</a>
