	  <p>Dear Friend,</p>
	  <p>Hello from San Rafael, CA. It's been a busy summer here at CTI, and I want to take a moment to tell you about an amazing new program we created called <strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong>. This is a completely new type of course from CTI. Heavily influenced by the Co-Active Leadership program, this course is intended for EVERYONE--not just coaches. In fact, it was purposefully designed to bring the &quot;Co-Active Way&quot; to the general public. If you have ever dreamed of sharing the Co-Active model with a friend, partner or colleague, this CTI course is your chance.</p>
	  <p>We have already run this program twice in the Bay Area for nearly 200 participants, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Now we are ready to take Quest on the road, and we'd LOVE for you to be there with us!&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>Quest--A Leader's Journey will be held on <strong>November 30-December 2, 2007, in Washington, D.C. </strong>The tuition for Quest is $750.</p>
	  <p>Have I piqued your interest? I hope so. Rather than flood you with details in this email, I want to personally invite you to attend a call I'm hosting on <strong>Thursday, October 25, from 3-4 p.m. Pacific</strong>. On the call, I will provide more details about the program and address any questions you may have. &nbsp;</p>
	  <p>To register for the call, please click here: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/Quest/contact-form-8378.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Quest Call</a>. You can also find out more about the Quest (or sign-up directly) by visiting our website at <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/quest" target="_blank" class="orange">http://www.thecoaches.com/quest</a>.</p>
	  <p>I hope you can make my call. I can't wait to tell you about what we've created!</p>
	  <p>Much love, </p>
	  <p>Karen</p>
