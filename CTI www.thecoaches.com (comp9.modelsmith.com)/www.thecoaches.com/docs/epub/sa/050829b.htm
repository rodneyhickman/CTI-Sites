	    Story Workshop<br>
	    Chicago Metropolitan Area<br>
	    December

	     3 and 4, 2005</b>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CTI’s pioneering innovations in coaching and leadership have resulted from a continual loop of piloting new cutting edge ideas and learning from participants’ reactions and feedback.  The Magic Shop enables CTI’s founders to continue to innovate and pilot new ideas.  As participants in these pilots, you get to experience the latest creations of these industry visionaries and play a role in shaping our industry's future. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This





	   latest program coming out of





	   The Magic Shop is sure to change





	   your life by beginning at the





	   beginning and asking the crucial





	   questions one often dodges asking





	   oneself:
	  <ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
          <li>“What is next for my life and how can I consciously create what I want?”
          <li>“What do I need to leave behind in order to do that?”
        <li>“What
 
 
 
           is the story that I tell
 
 
 
           about myself to others?
          What
 
 
           is the story that I want
          to tell?”
            </ul>	
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">In



















	   this two-day <strong>Vision



















	    Story</strong> workshop,



















	     you will: 
	<ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
          <li>Come away with an inspired and focused Vision Story that will lead to manifesting the fullest sense of who you are in your life.
          <li>Burn
            through the limiting
            beliefs that hold you
            back and take the next
            steps beyond them to
            make your vision real.
          <li> Work
 
 
 
 
             from a place of clarity
 
 
 
 
             and congruence, created
 
 
 
 
             by internally aligning
 
 
 
 
             with yourself.          
          <li> Be
 
 
 
 
             witnessed in community
 
 
 
             as you commit to the
 
 
 
             path you most desire
 
 
 
 
             to take in your life.          
          <li>Not
 
 
             only come away with
 
 
             increased fuel and
            motivation for yourself
 
             in moving forward but
 
             also learn how to use
 
             this tool to inspire
 
             and excite your clients.
