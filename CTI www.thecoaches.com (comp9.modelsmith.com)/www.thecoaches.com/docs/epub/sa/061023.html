      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><span style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/sa/images/Whatsnext1023.jpg" width="510" height="20"><br>

	</span>Our theme for the 2006 conference is “What’s next for you?” Whatever it is, we’re inviting you to “take off with CTI!” So please come join us at Booth #211 to say hello and have your personal consultation with our Admissions Advisors, who will all be on hand. While you’re there, be sure to pick up your special, complimentary “take off” starter kit and enter our daily drawings. We’re offering exclusive conference specials and packages again this year. Newcomers to CTI programs also receive a bonus when they enroll at the conference.

Our  sponsor this year is The Co-Active Network, an international online community gathering place for all coaches that’s now 8,000 members strong. The party theme is “A Trip Around the Co-Active Network.” Join us and meet coaches from around the world at stations representing different geographical niches on the Network. Appetizers and desserts matched with each region are close by each station.
