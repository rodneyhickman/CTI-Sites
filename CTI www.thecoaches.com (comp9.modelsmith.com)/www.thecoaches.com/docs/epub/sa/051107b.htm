	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Do you feel <i>blah </i>about your life? Is your life not where you imagined it would be at your age? Do you want to change your career, end a relationship that isn’t working for you, start a new project, get unstuck, find new inspiration for yourself, see your life from a completely different perspective, or invoke a powerful force of change for your life? </b>

	<p class="style1" style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b>Vision Story</b>™ will inspire you and your clients, friends, colleagues, co-workers and family members to create positive change in your lives.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">This
	   latest program coming out of
	   The Magic Shop at CTI is sure to change
	   your life by beginning at the
	   beginning and asking the crucial
	   questions one often dodges asking
	   oneself:
	  <ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
          <li>“What is next for my life and how can I consciously create what I want?”
          <li>“What do I need to leave behind in order to do that?”
        <li>“What
           is the story that I tell
           about myself to others?"
        <li>&quot;What
           is the story that I want
          to tell?”
      </ul>	
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">In
	   this two-day <strong>Vision
	    Story&#8482;</strong> workshop,



















	     you will: 
	<ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
          <li>Come away with an inspired and focused Vision Story that will lead to manifesting the fullest sense of who you are in your life.
          <li>Break
            through the limiting
            beliefs that hold you
            back and take the next
            steps beyond them to
            make your vision real.
          <li> Work
 
 
 
 
             from a place of clarity
 
 
 
 
             and congruence, created
 
 
 
 
             by internally aligning
 
 
 
 
             with yourself.          
          <li> Be
 
 
 
 
             witnessed in community
 
 
 
             as you commit to the
 
 
 
             path you most desire
 
 
 
 
             to take in your life.          
          <li>Not
 
 
             only come away with
 
 
             increased fuel and

             and excite your clients.
