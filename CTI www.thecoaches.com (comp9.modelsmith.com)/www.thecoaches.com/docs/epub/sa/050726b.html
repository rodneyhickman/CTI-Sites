	<p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear CPCCs:
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As you know, one of the benefits of becoming a CPCC is that you can be listed on the Find-a-Coach function on CTI’s website. If you’ve taken advantage of that benefit in the past, you may also be aware that the search capabilities have been limited. We have some exciting news for you!
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">	The Find-a-Coach function on our website has been completely reconstructed and now has a new search function and more efficiency overall. The “new and improved” Find-a-Coach function will use your profile on the Co-Active Network. This will allow potential clients to search for you based on criteria listed in your extended profile, such as fee range, interests, experience, etc. Any search from the Find-A-Coach page will look similar to a “member search” on the Co-Active Network but will only search for CPCCs.     
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As of August 15, the existing Find-a-Coach database will no longer exist. Unfortunately, since the existing Find-a-Coach database and the new database have a much different structure, we cannot transfer your existing information from the old database to the new one. If you would like to continue or begin coming up as an available coach when people are using the Find-A-Coach function on the CTI website, you’ll need to:    <ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
          <li>Make sure you sign up to become a member of the <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com" target="_blank" class="orange">Co-Active Network</a> by August 15, 2005. (If you don’t want to receive emails from the Co-Active Network, go to the “Manage Account” page and uncheck all the checkboxes for the communities you’ve joined. Click on “Save Changes.” When you’d like to start receiving the emails, go back to the same page and re-check the appropriate checkboxes. Click on “Save Changes.”)
          <li>Complete your profile on the Co-Active Network. Indicate that you are a CPCC by checking the “CPCC” checkbox under the Coaching Credentials section. Include any information you want prospective clients to know about you and consider adding your photo to your profile. 
          <li>	If you are already a member of the Co-Active Network, double check that you have checked the “CPCC” checkbox under the Coaching Credentials section.
		
</ul>	
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">If you have any questions about setting up your profile, please contact Andrew Gabel at <a href="mailto:networksupport@thecoaches.com" class="orange">networksupport@thecoaches.com</a>.     
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re very excited about the expanded capabilities of Find-a-Coach. You can update your information at any time by simply logging on to the Co-Active Network and editing your profile. And…potential clients will be able to search much more effectively to find you.	      
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">See you online!
