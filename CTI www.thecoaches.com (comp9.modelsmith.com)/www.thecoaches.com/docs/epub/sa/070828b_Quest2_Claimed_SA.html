	  <p>Greetings,</p>
	  <p>Just a quick reminder! Don't forget to join Karen on her Quest Information Call. To register for the call, please click here: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/Quest/contact-form-4302.html.">Quest Call</a>.</p>
	  <p>In case you missed our original email from August 9, I have included it below. Please read on for more details about CTI's exciting new program, Quest--A Leader's Journey.</p>
	  <p>You are receiving this personal invitation because you were identified by one of our course leaders as a perfect candidate for our Leadership program. I understand the Leadership program is a large commitment, and I wanted to offer you the opportunity to begin your journey with a smaller step. On September 14, CTI will be launching its newest program: <strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong>. This program is an excellent catalyst for anyone considering CTI's Leadership program.</p>
	  <p>Quest, designed to &quot;build muscle around clarity,&quot; is a powerful program that helps leaders identify their true purpose and move forward with confidence and grace by answering the questions: </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Who am I?</strong> &quot;<em>An exploration of your      authentic self&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>Where am I going?</strong> <em>&quot;The compelling path that      pulls you forward&quot;</em></li>
	    <li><strong>How do I get there?</strong> <em>&quot;Bringing your sense of      purpose to the world&quot;</em></li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Over the course of three days, you will embark on a journey to discover the answers to the three questions above.&nbsp;You will become deeply intimate with your essence, the center of what is most important to you, and discover ways to begin bringing your authentic self and purpose more fully into the world.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>This is a brand new program for CTI. It contains all new content and a brand new format, as you will be working with a large group but in a way that still holds the intimacy and power of a CTI experience.</p>
	  <p><strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong> will be held September 14-16 in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/SFOFHHH-Hilton-San-Francisco-California/index.do" target="_blank" class="orange">Hilton San Francisco</a>. The fee for this pilot program is $595.</p>
	  <p>Rather than flood you with details in this email, I invite you to attend a call I'm hosting. On the call, I will provide more detail about the program and address any questions you may have. To register for the call, please click here: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/Quest/contact-form-4302.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Quest Call</a>.</p>
	  <p>I look forward to telling you more about this exciting, new program from CTI!</p>
	  <p>Much love,</p>
	  <p>Karen</p>
