	  <p>Hello,</p>
	  <p>I'm writing to you today to let you know about a special opportunity to be part of CTI's new &quot;Executive and Internal Co-Active Coach&quot; Training Program. This program, based on our industry-leading coach training curriculum, has been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who want to train as internal or external executive/organizational coaches. </p>
	  <p>We have run this program internally at organizations with great success and this is the first time it will be offered as an open enrolment course. Participants in the upcoming workshop include individuals training to become corporate coaches as well as internal coaching staff from organizations such as Google, Microsoft, The US Navy, Lockheed Martin and Capital Health. </p>
	  <p>We still have a few seats left for the upcoming workshop on March 4-6. We invite you to contact a CTI Program Advisor to learn more about this exciting new program and to reserve your seat. </p>
	  <p>You can reach our program advisors by phone at 800-691-6008; or via email at: <a href="mailto:admissions@thecoaches.com" class="orange">admissions@thecoaches.com</a>.</p>
