	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><font size="3"><b>Retreat 5: Leadership Mastery</b></font>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>What</i> is the focus of Retreat 5: Leadership Mastery?</b><br>Retreat 5 begins where Retreat 4 leaves off, and moves your leadership forward by taking you to new heights of <i>Level 4 Leadership</i>: full permission and full responsibility for impact. You will <b><i>learn a new technology</i></b> for more accurately reading and interacting with "Level 3" (no kidding!), with lots of opportunity for Level 4 leadership and feedback. Some of the skills you will hone during this retreat include: deepening of <b><i>Full Permission</i></b> and taking <b><i>Responsibility for Impact</i></b>; big stretches in <b><i>Co-Leading</i></b>; an unforgettable experience of <b><i>Creating from Everything</i></b>; and you'll have lots of <b><i>FUN</i></b> (of course)!
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>Who</i> is leading the pilot programs?</b><br>The first pilot will be co-led by all three founders, Karen Kimsey-House, Laura Whitworth and Henry Kimsey-House. The second pilot will be co-led by two of the three founders.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>When</i> is this program being offered?</b><br>Two pilot programs will be offered in 2005. The first will be March 15-20 and the second pilot will be July 12-17. Both pilot programs will begin at 11 a.m. on Tuesday and end at 3 p.m. Sunday. 
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>Where</i> are the pilot programs being held and what are the facilities like?</b><br>Both pilot programs will be held at Mountain Home Ranch, located on 300 acres in the hills bordering Sonoma and Napa counties, 15 minutes from the resort town of Calistoga and 20 minutes from Santa Rosa. It has been a family owned/operated facility since 1913. Facilities include a main lodge, two meeting rooms, modern cabins with bathrooms and many other "ranch-style" amenities, including a few farm animals.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>What about the FOOD?</i></b><br>One of their references reports, "The food is mouth-wateringly wonderful, and the staff prides itself on meeting all special dietary needs with imagination, quality and delight." We couldn't drag Lisa away from the Mother Tree, but Mountain Home Ranch does have an award-winning chef who will accommodate your dietary needs.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>How much</i> is the cost of the pilot program?</b><br>The total cost for the pilot program is $2,500 USD. This cost includes all tuition, meals and residential fees for six days and five nights. It does not include transportation to or from the retreat center.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><b><i>How</i> do I register or obtain more information?</b><br>For more information, to request a registration form or to register by phone, please contact Eloise Tweeten at the Leadership office: <a class="orange" href="mailto:Eloise@thecoaches.com">Eloise@thecoaches.com</a> or 707-829-1110.
