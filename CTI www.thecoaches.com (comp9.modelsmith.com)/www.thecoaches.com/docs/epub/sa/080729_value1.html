            <p>Hello  CTI Community:</p>
            <p>I feel deep gratitude this morning for the gift of CTI in my life and for the gift of all of you. Thank you so much for your partnership, for the people that you send to our courses, for the ways in which you are being Co-Active with your clients, co-workers and families, and for all the many ways that you spread the Co-Active Way. </p>
            <p>Even though we may never have met, I can feel your heart in the matter. I know that you have come to coaching in general, and to CTI in particular, because you care deeply about people and about the world that we live in. </p>
            <p>We have been asking a lot of you lately with emails and campaigns, as CTI finds its way to a larger arena and more visibility. You'll notice a shift in our communication with you over the coming months. In addition to letting you know about upcoming opportunities here at CTI, we'll also be looking to contribute in ways that create value for you and provide you with tools that are current and useful.</p>
            <p>Below you'll find information on our &quot;Acknowledgment&quot; campaign. I'm very excited about it! </p>
            <p>When times are rough, there's a tendency to &quot;hunker down&quot; and close ourselves off from others. That's completely understandable and normal. I notice that tendency within myself. However, it's my sense that in order for all of us to evolve, we need to grow our capacity to include the very real circumstances and reach beyond them. We need to s---t---r---e---t---c---h our hearts and our ability to love and connect with each other not just when things are going smoothly, but particularly when we are more challenged and probably a little afraid.</p>
            <p>That's why we want to put the spotlight on acknowledgment. I feel that it is critically important that we practice reaching beyond the current circumstances and start challenging our ability to lean into each other, and to recognize the beauty and magnificence that is all around.</p>
            <p>In the midst of your busy day, I ask that you take a moment to take a breath and connect with yourself and someone else by acknowledging them.&nbsp;Let your heart open to the gratitude that lives within you and share that with another in respect and appreciation. There is nothing more empowering than being seen, celebrated and known for who you are. </p>
            <p>Please join CTI in spreading this contagion of acknowledgment with those you encounter. Invite others to &quot;pay it forward&quot; and share their stories on <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/" target="_blank"><strong>CTI's homepage</strong></a>. </p>
            <p>Much love,</p>
            <p>Karen<br />
