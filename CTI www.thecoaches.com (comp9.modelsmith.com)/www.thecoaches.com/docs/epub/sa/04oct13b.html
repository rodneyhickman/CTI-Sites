	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We sent you an email a few months ago announcing a new Co-Active Relationship Systems Coaching course, Relationship Dojo. We've had several questions about this course recently, so we're sending the information again.

	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">What is "Relationship Dojo"?
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">A dojo is the training hall in martial arts where sweaty, physical rigor meets the inner stillness of spiritual practice. Relationship Dojo is a new course in the Relationship Systems Coaching Program and, much like a martial arts dojo, it provides a learning space where you can deepen and hone the skills of Relationship Systems Coaching. This three-day advanced course is open only to those who have completed the Relationship Systems Coaching curriculum through The Way of Relationship.
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><b>Don't miss this opportunity to participate in the first offering of this advanced Relationship Systems Coaching course!</b>
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0">Relationship Dojo integrates the dimensions of Relationship River, Relationship Geography and The Way of Relationship through hands-on practice, group supervision, a deepened understanding of the underpinnings of the model and practice, practice, practice.
