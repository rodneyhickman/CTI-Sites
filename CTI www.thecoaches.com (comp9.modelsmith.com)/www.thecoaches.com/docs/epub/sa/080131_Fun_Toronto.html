	  <p>Greetings,</p>
	  <p>On March 7, The Coaches Training Institute will be holding its two-and-a-half-day Co-Active Fundamentals course at the <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/pdfs/TOR-SHER_3.7.pdf" target="_blank" class="orange">Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel</a> in Toronto, ON, and there are still a few seats available! If you are considering coach training, now is a great time to take action!</p>
	  <p><strong><u>About Fundamentals</u></strong><br>
	    Co-Active Fundamentals is a two-and-a-half-day course that will have a lasting impact on your clarity, confidence and creativity in relation to how you interact with the people in your life. Learn how to break though self-perceived limits and experience the essential ingredients to help make your life and career exactly what you want them to be! This course is oriented toward participation and practical experience, rather than lecture. You will have extensive opportunities to coach and to receive feedback on your coaching. </p>
	  <p><strong>As a result of taking this course, you will learn to:</strong> </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use the four cornerstones of Co-Active Coaching with your clients. </li>
	    <li>Communicate with your clients using the five contexts of Co-Active Coaching. </li>
	    <li>Use the life (balance) wheel with clients. </li>
	    <li>Distinguish and use the three levels of listening. </li>
	    <li>Demonstrate the most-often-used coaching skills. </li>
      </ul>
