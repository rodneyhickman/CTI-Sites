	  <p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear Friends, <BR>
        <BR>
	    We are delighted to let all of you know that the second edition for <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> is fresh off the presses and available now at major retailers across North America and the United Kingdom.<BR>
  <BR>
	  <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/New-2nd-Edition-CoActive-Coaching-Book/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/sa/images/Co-Active_cover.jpg" alt="Co-Active Coaching 2nd Edition Book Cover" width="144" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right"></a>Laura, Henry, Phil and I created the first edition of the book because we believed passionately in the power of Co-Active coaching. Looking back over the last decade, we are grateful and humbled by the impact both the book and the Co-Active model have had in launching the professional practice of coaching, and in empowering individuals, teams and organizations around the world.<BR>
  <BR>
	  Our goal in writing the second edition was to make it relevant today, almost a decade later, in a world where co-workers and teammates, direct reports and managers, teachers and students, have joined individuals in using the powerful tools of the Co-Active model. The second edition contains a wide-ranging set of fresh coaching examples drawn from our firsthand experience with thousands of international coaching trainees and clients over this period. The power-packed Coach's Toolkit has been expanded to include more than 35 exercises, questionnaires, checklists and reproducible forms, tailored where applicable to both individual and corporate clients. New appendices provide perspective on the impact of the Co-Active coaching model on organizations, coaching the team or relationship and the role of the International Coach Federation (ICF) in setting professional and ethical standards for the industry. Last and, definitely not least, the second edition includes a CD containing sample audio coaching sessions by the authors and printable forms from the Coach's Toolkit. <BR>
  <BR>
	  If you're a coach in training, the second edition is an even stronger resource for you as you learn and apply new coaching skills. If you're a seasoned coach working with individuals or teams, the second edition provides new, extended examples of coaching in action and printable resources to use in your practice. <BR>
  <BR>
	  Although I am a fervent advocate of Co-Active coaching, I feel that the greatest application of the Co-Active model comes in everyday living. It is in our relationships with our co-workers, family, children and friends that we can fully utilize and practice Co-Active principles. I invite readers of the second edition to view the model through this lens in particular, as a way to be more effective and in better relationship with those people who matter most. <BR>
  <BR>
	  Thank you for the love and care that you bring to the conversation of Co-Active coaching and for being such a terrific community of ambassadors. <BR>
  <BR>
	  With much love, <BR>
  <BR>
