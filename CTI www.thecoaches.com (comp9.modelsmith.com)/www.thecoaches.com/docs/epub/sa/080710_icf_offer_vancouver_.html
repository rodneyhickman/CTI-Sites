            <p>Dear ICF Member:</p>
            <p>After attending several Prism awards all over North America, it is evident that the dawn of coaching is upon us! The business community's commitment to coaching as a leadership strategy is growing exponentially. </p>
            <p>It was a pleasure for The Coaches Training Institute to be a sponsor at the groundbreaking Vancouver ICF Prism Awards--we were thrilled to be a part of awarding visionary companies and their coaches with the recognition they deserve. </p>
            <p>Leadership challenges affect every business, and coaching has proven a reliable map when it comes to navigating new cultural communication and behaviors. Many of you have heard of our Co-Active Leadership program and wondered if it would benefit your coaching practice. We promise that this program will give you a wider range of self-expression, the flexibility to dance with whatever shows up and the strength to stand in your power. You will be changed in ways you never knew possible, especially in your ability to influence people. Your new-found impact then shows up with clients and speaking audiences, as they are drawn to your positive and respectful leadership stance.</p>
            <p><strong>To help you along your Leadership path, we have a special offer for all Vancouver ICF members. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Special offer to Vancouver ICF members: $200 off the cost of <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/coactive.html" target="_blank">FUNDAMENTALS</a>, </strong><strong>which you may also pass on to a client or interested party asking you about coach training. </strong> </p>
            <p>In the spirit of generosity, The Coaches Training Institute applauds all of you working in your communities to bring balance, authenticity, integrity and respect into our world. We hope to meet you at one of our beautiful North Carolina or stunning Northern California Leadership retreats. </p>
            <p>Warm regards, </p>
            <p>Maria Felice Cunningham, ICF Global partnership</p></td>
