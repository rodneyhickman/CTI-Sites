	  <p>Dear CTI Graduate, </p>
	  <p>In case our May announcement missed you, we wanted to remind you that effective July 8, 2007, CTI will be increasing the tuition for our Core Coach Training and Certification programs.</p>
	  <p>For your convenience, below is the original announcement we sent out to all CTI graduates. It outlines the price increase (about 20%) and the special offer of $300.00 off the Certification tuition. Please take a moment to review the information below and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or would like to register for the Certification program.</p>
