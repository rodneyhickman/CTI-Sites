	<p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Hello to Our CTI Colleagues!<br>
	</b>
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">We’re excited to let you know that CTI’s Business Development Program (BDP) is back and better than ever! CTI is thrilled to be in partnership with The Business Catalyst Institute, founded by Leslie Lupinsky, CPCC, MCC, and Dorcas Kelley, CPCC, CMC, ACC, two highly respected professionals in the creation and implementation of the new program. Their Business Catalyst courses in the earlier BDP program were very popular, and students reported many successes. Together, we have developed a whole new program design, which we feel will be more in sync with the preferences and needs of coaches who want to build a firm foundation for their coaching business and/or get themselves fired up for expansion and growth.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">In this email, we provide you with an overview of the new BDP. We also invite you to attend a free BDP information call either on December 5 (at 5 p.m. PST) or December 20 (at 6 p.m. PST). To register for an info call, or to receive further program details, please contact us at 1-800-691-6008, x-655, or visit <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/business" target="_blank" class="orange">www.thecoaches.com/business</a> or email <a href="mailto:BDPinfo@thecoaches.com" class="orange">BDPinfo@thecoaches.com</a>.    
	<p><b>What is  different about the new BDP?</b><br>
	  It&rsquo;s now a modularized and  personalized program that allows you to take classes</p>
	<ul>
        <li>in the order you need,</li>
	     <li>when you need them,</li>
	     <li>when       you&rsquo;re ready.</li>
      </ul>	
	<p>We&rsquo;re committed to making the process accessible and  clear, and to bringing ease and enjoyment into your business. </p>
	<p><b>How will this program impact your business?</b></p>
	<ul type="disc">

	<p><b>What are people saying about the new Business Development Program?</b><br>
&ldquo;It was exciting to learn that I can do the&nbsp;business  end of my coaching practice my own unique way, and now my heart is in my  business AND my clients, and both are fun and flourishing!&rdquo; <br>
&mdash;Nancy Slocum, CPCC</p>
	<p>&ldquo;I knew that the only thing that would stop me from  succeeding as a coach would be the dreaded &lsquo;sales&rsquo; function of promoting my own  business. Today, nothing holds me back. I have learned the skills of enrollment  and the &lsquo;dreaded&rsquo; has become fun and exciting for me.&rdquo;<br>
