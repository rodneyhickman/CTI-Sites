              <p>Hello CTI graduate, student and friend,</p>
              <p>I hope this note finds you and yours well. For some of you, it has been quite some time since you've connected with your fellow CTI classmates. Time passes quickly even though we intend to be in touch on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>This notion sparked an idea!</p>
              <p>So many things have changed in our world during the past month; for many, fears have increased. Our politicians model segregation, our systems are challenged, and we are close to the birth of a new paradigm.</p>
              <p>This is the opportunity for us coaches to step up, walk our talk and be of service. Now is the time. People want assistance in shifting their thoughts; they are motivated and looking for what is next in their life in the face of global change.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Get involved: </strong><br />
              </p>
              <ul>
    <li>
      <p>When you volunteer, what do you think of yourself? </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When have you stepped into something new? Networked? Met new people and created new opportunities? </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>How can your creative energy shine while being of service? <br />
        </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
              <p>Just like coaching, being of service is personally rewarding.</p>
              <p>At this Wednesday's ICF meeting, Keith Miller will be introduced as the Los Angeles ICF Chapter 2009 president, and he would love your support and attendance. He personally invites you to choose to participate with others on a committee, volunteer or be nominated for a Board role. This is how coaches become visible and successful, how they increase exposure, credibility and their network. </p>
              <p>You do not have to be a member of ICF National nor in LA. Your first meeting is only $30 per person, and all you have to do is reply to <a href="mailto:Keith@iPECcoaching.com"><strong>Keith@iPECcoaching.com</strong></a> by Wednesday morning if you and a guest are attending. Dinner is included. Payment at the door; cash, check or credit card is fine.</p>
