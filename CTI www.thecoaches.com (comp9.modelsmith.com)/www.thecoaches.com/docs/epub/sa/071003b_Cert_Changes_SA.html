	  <p>Dear Students:</p>
	  <p>Over the past few months, we have surveyed hundreds of current and former Certification students in an attempt to identify ways we can grow the value of CTI&rsquo;s Certification program.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>We came away from these conversations with some great insights and began putting some changes into practice by piloting them in a select group of Certification pods. &nbsp;Since the pilots have been successful, we are now rolling these changes out to all Certification Program pods beginning <strong>October 2007</strong>.&nbsp; We believe the changes outlined below will both accelerate your path to becoming a CPCC, as well as boost the overall impact of the program.&nbsp;</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
	    <li><strong>Change in Client Requirements</strong><br>
	      You will still need five clients throughout the program; however, we have changed the requirements. 
	    <p>Your five clients need to be in place by the second pod call. This allows you anywhere from 30-45 additional days to get clients. It also gives you the opportunity to have your coach, Certification Pod Leader, and pod mates support you in the process of securing clients.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Client Support</strong><br>
	  <strong><em>Once you have been confirmed into a Certification pod</em></strong>, you will be invited to attend a series of three additional teleconference calls, at no extra cost, to support you in getting your clients.&nbsp; </p>
	    <p>It is our intention that getting clients be as FUN and EASY for you as possible.&nbsp;The calls will be recorded, in case you cannot attend them live.&nbsp;They will start a few weeks prior to your first Certification pod call.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Easier Application Process</strong><br> 
	  We have streamlined the application and created a separate information packet so that it is now easier to follow and takes less time for you to complete. </p>
	  <p>Attached, please find the link to Certification enrollment. Here, you can access the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Certification Application, as well as the Certification Information Packet. Please discard any applications that you may have previously received, as you will be required to submit the latest version.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>All Program Material Available Electronically</strong><br> 
	  The program manual and recordings are now available in PDF and MP3 formats. This new format allows lots of flexibility in accessing your materials. You can now keep all material in an electronic or a downloadable format so that you can access your files any time. You can also copy your material onto CDs or onto an iPod. &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>We&rsquo;re excited about supporting your success in your Certification program through these changes. Again,&nbsp;please discard any applications that you may have previously received, as you will be required to submit the latest version.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>For more information about the program and the new application, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/certification/enrollment.html" target="_blank" class="orange">please click here.</a> </p>
