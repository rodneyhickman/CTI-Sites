	  <p>Dear Fellow CPCCs, <br>
        <br>
I hope you are enjoying the late days of summer! At CTI, the warm weather has brought a burst of creativity and a new initiative that I am incredibly excited about. We have designed and piloted a completely new program called &ldquo;<strong>Quest.</strong>&rdquo; The program is based on the Co-Active Leadership model and is specifically designed for participants who want to experience the magic and impact of CTI&rsquo;s work but may not be interested in becoming a coach. Finally, something from CTI that you can share with your family and friends!</p>
	  <p>As the name may suggest, this course is closely aligned with the Co-Active Leadership Model and is one of the most ambitious designs we&rsquo;ve ever attempted. I have no doubt this program will change lives and be at the center of who CTI is becoming&mdash;and I <strong><em>know</em></strong> we need <strong><u>your</u></strong> help to make this program a success.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
	    Over the course of three days, the participants of Quest will embark on a journey into their own personal leadership. They will become deeply intimate with their essence, the center of what is most important to them, and discover ways to begin bringing their authenticity and purpose more fully into the world. The program contains all new content and a brand new format, as we will be working with a large group, but in a way that still holds the intimacy and power of a CTI experience. &nbsp;</p>
	  <p>As you may know, we held a Quest pilot in July for CPCCs only. The feedback from all who participated was invaluable and has resulted in a program I could not be more proud of. But there is still a little work to be done&mdash;and here is where I still need your help. I want to invite you to play with us <strong>September 14-16</strong> and be part of the final design process by: </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Registering      for the program and coming ready to be a full-out participant!</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inviting      a client, friend or family member to participate in the program with you!      Anyone you invite will receive a $100 discount off the regular tuition of      $595&mdash;and so will you! (That&rsquo;s a $100 discount for each of you). There is      no limit to the number of guests you can bring. When you or your guest      register for Quest, simply enter the coupon code listed below in the field      provided on the registration page and your discount will be applied. The      program is being held in beautiful downtown San Francisco, and your evenings      will be free to enjoy the great restaurants and culture. <strong>Coupon Code:      091407</strong></li>
      </ul>
	  <p><strong>Expand Your Client Base with Quest!</strong><br>
	    There is also a unique <strong>business opportunity for CPCCs only</strong>. We will use the September Quest program to begin training CPCCs to become &ldquo;Quest Coaches.&rdquo; In future Quest programs, we will be assigning participants personal coaches following the workshop, and we want to build a pool of talented CPCCs to handle these coaching assignments. Experiencing the Quest program as a participant is the first step to becoming a CTI Quest Coach; attending this program could be a great investment in your business!</p>
	  <p>Quest will be held September 14-16 in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/SFOFHHH-Hilton-San-Francisco-California/index.do" target="_blank" class="orange">Hilton San Francisco</a>. The fee for this pilot program is $595.</p>
	  <p>Rather than flood you with details in this email, <strong>I invite you to attend a call</strong> I&rsquo;m hosting. On the call, I will provide more detail about the program, the &ldquo;Quest Coach&rdquo; business opportunity and address any questions you may have. To register for the call, please click here: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/Quest/contact-form-4301.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Quest Call</a>.</p>
	  <p>Please come and play with me! &nbsp; <br>
          <br>
	    Much love,<br>
  <br>
	    Karen</p>
