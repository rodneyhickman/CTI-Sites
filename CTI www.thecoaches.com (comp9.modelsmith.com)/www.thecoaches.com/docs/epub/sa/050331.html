	<p style="margin: 15 0 0 0">Dear CPCC,
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">One of the most significant recent additions to our Certification Program was the creation of a twelve CD set including lectures and coaching demonstrations by our faculty and founders, with introductions and debriefs by CTI co-founder Karen Kimsey-House.  Those of you who completed the Certification Program before the CD's were available let us know that you would like to have them for your continued learning and growth as a coach.  We know you have invested a lot in your coaching training and in CTI, so we are making a single set available to each of you who have completed the Certification Program for $49.95 (plus shipping).
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">To order this 12-CD set, you must be a member of the Co-Active Network and must have completed your profile indicating that you are a CPCC.  Joining the Co-Active Network takes only a minute though I encourage you to take the time to fill out your profile completely as we expect to use it as an updated Find-A-Coach profile later in 2005.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Once you have joined the Co-Active Network and have completed (and saved) your extended profile indicating you are a CPCC, you will see a listing "CPCC's only" under "Business Tools" in the left hand menu.  If you don't see it, log out of the Network and log back in - some systems retain cookies which remember the home page from a previous visit.  Click on "CPCC's Only" to be taken to the page to order the CD-set.  On the second page of your order, you will have several shipping options available. Click on the drop-down menu next to "Shipping methods" to choose the method you prefer.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">These CD's are available only to CTI's Certified Professional Co-Active Coaches (CPCC's).  We have created enough copies for each of you to order a single set for your own personal use.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Please remember that the CD's are the intellectual property of CTI and my not be copied or distributed without written permission from CTI.  Also, the CD's are an important part of the Certification Program, so sharing the CD's with someone else could spoil their experience of the program.
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Thank you for all you've invested both in CTI and in being the best coach you can be.
