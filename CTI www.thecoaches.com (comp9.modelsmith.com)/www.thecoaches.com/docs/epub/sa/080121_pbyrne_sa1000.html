	  <p>Dear fellow CPCCs:</p>
	  <p>My name is Paul Byrne, and I am Vice President of Marketing for The Coaches Training Institute. The reason for my email today is to share with you something that is deeply important to me&hellip;and I suspect may be for you, as well. I'd like to provide a bit of context as to who I am and what brought me to CTI, share a bit about what I have learned from my time here and, most importantly, ask for your help with a challenge I am undertaking.</p>
	  <p>I've been part of the Co-Active Coaching community for the past four years. I attended CTI's coach training courses in London back in 2003, graduated from the Leadership Program in 2006 and have served on the CTI management team for nearly 18 months. The journey that brought me to CTI, and ultimately has me writing to you today, is one I'd like to share with you. </p>
	  <p>Six years ago, I was working 70 hours/week running the European division for a U.S. consulting firm. I lived in Amsterdam, had my office in London and spent most of my waking hours on a plane, in meetings or frantically rushing from one to the other. I was considered successful, I was making money, and I was miserable. My wonderful wife, whom I met while backpacking around the world, was becoming a stranger. My beautiful one-year-old daughter barely recognized me, and I was a shadow of the man I aspired to be. The irony, of course, is that I assumed this is what life was about: work hard, do what's expected and don't complain. </p>
	  <p>Around this time, a dear friend told me about a quirky little California company that was running coach training workshops in London. He said it might be good for my &quot;management skills,&quot; and with that little bit of left-brain justification, I signed myself up for Fundamentals of Co-Active Coaching--and that's where it began for me. I had no idea at the time (or for some time after), but attending Fundamentals set in motion a process of self-reflection and personal development that continues today. I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say that my life (on most days) is now lived with purpose, conviction and passion. Oh, and yes, I did become a MUCH better manager and leader! Over the years, I've continued to pass along the sage advice my friend gave me; I&rsquo;ve probably sent a dozen or more employees, friends and family members to the Fundamentals program. All had a unique experience, and none ever regretted giving up the two and a half days. </p>
	  <p>As CPCCs, I suspect that many of you have also recommended CTI's programs to those in your world. I'm continually amazed by the impact our graduate community has on growing CTI's business. In my mind, this word-of-mouth &quot;marketing&quot; is the engine of CTI's business and largely responsible for the fact that the &ldquo;Co-Active Way&rdquo; is impacting lives in more than 16 countries. I'm blessed with the opportunity to witness the results of these efforts. And not a week goes by that I don't hear stories of a life awakened, relationship healed or new career launched. I'm humbled by the impact of this two-and-a-half-day workshop and want more people to have access to these skills. This is, in fact, the single reason I moved back to the United States and took the job at CTI. I see the impact this work has on individuals, organizations and the society, and I want to see this grow exponentially. Which leads me to my request&hellip;</p>
	  <p>In the language we have all learned so well, I request that each of you partner with me to spread the news about a significant update to the Fundamentals course. Fundamentals is now absolutely and completely appropriate for both those who plan to become professional coaches, as well as individuals who would benefit from integrating coaching skills into their existing talents. <u>Let me repeat this</u>. Fundamentals is for people who are looking at coaching as a career AND those who plan to use the skills as a catalyst for success in business and life. We have run a few of these updated programs, and the response has been fantastic! From small business owners and sales professionals to HR executives and coaches-in-training, everyone is coming away with a deep appreciation for these Co-Active skills and a unique take on how to best integrate them into their work and lives. </p>
	  <p><strong>So here is the challenge:</strong><br>
	    I've made a personal (and now public!) commitment to get 1,000 individuals registered to take Fundamentals in the next 100 days. Yup, <strong>1,000 lives in 100 days! </strong>Yikes, did I just say that out loud? There is no possible way this can happen without your help--and together, I suspect we can make this <u>fun</u> and rewarding, and have a real impact on people's lives.</p>
	  <p>In an effort to support you all, I've created a few tools to assist you in spreading the word. Please have a look:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Please check out my blog at (<a href="http://www.1000in100.com/" target="_blank" class="orange">http://www.1000in100.com</a>). This is the place you can get real-time statistics on how we are doing with the campaign (days left and number registered). I'll also be posting video and audio segments with some special guest appearances, so stay tuned and check back regularly. This will be &quot;mission control&quot; for the effort, and all tools and resourses can be accessed here.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul>
	    <li>I have created a few email templates you can cut and paste directly into your emails. You can get them here: (<a href="http://1000in100.googlepages.com/" target="_blank" class="orange">http://1000in100.googlepages.com</a>), as well as on my blog. They offer a brief introduction to the Fundamentals program and include an invitation to attend a free webinar or live event on the power of coaching. There are templates for those who are looking at coaching as a career, as well as for individuals who may want to integrate coaching skills into their current work.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul>
	    <li>To support me in my challenge, during the next 100 days (until April 30, 2008), CTI will be reducing the price of Fundamentals by $200. Anyone registering during this period will <strong>attend Fundamentals for only $495</strong>. And, as always, it comes with a 100% money-back, no-questions-asked guarantee.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be rolling out more tools to support your word-of-mouth referrals. I want to sincerely thank you in advance for taking the time to help me! If we can each find <u>just one person</u> in the next 100 days, we will absolutely blow this goal away. That's all I need from you--just one person--your colleague, friend, lawyer, brother-in-law, etc. Anyone who you think may benefit form learning more about Co-Active Coaching. All of the informational events are free, and there is no obligation to do anything further. </p>
	  <p>So there it is: 1,000 lives in 100 days. Imagine the impact!</p>
	  <p>With great appreciation,</p>
	  <p>Paul, CPCC</p>
