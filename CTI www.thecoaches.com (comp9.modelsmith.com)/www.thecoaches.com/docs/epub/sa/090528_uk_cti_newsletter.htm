          <h1 class="style4">Welcome to CTI UK's <br />
            May 2009 Newsletter<br />
          </h1>
          <p class="style13 style29">Dear</p>
 
<p class="style13 style29">It's said that change is the only constant, and yet, even at times of radical planetary change, that we're experiencing now, it's all too easy to cling to the past for comfort and assurance. This is understandable, since it's rarely the case we're taught the essential life skills, in school or from our parents, that would otherwise allow us to navigate change from a position of empowerment. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">Yet, this is exactly what the Co-Active Coaching model offers. Not just a new way of being in relationship with others, but it also a powerful set of tools to help us confidently make the required choices we need to make to live the life we really want. It's no wonder then that many successful coaches, describe themselves as passionate students of the awe and excitement of change, where life is no longer a struggle to be endured, but an adventure to be lived. </p>     

<p class="style13 style29">If you've been receiving this newsletter for a while, you'll notice then, that we too are changing. &nbsp;The new look and feel, is part of CTI's new brand image, which we hope will help us share Co-Active more widely throughout the world. &nbsp;This feel will soon be reflected throughout our UK marketing, including our new CTI UK website, which we will be launching this summer. </p>  

<p class="style13 style29">In our <em>Learning Point</em> this month, we continue our exploration of the five contexts of Co-Active Coaching, with a look at the skill of listening, essential in identifying where our most powerful choices can be made. We profile one of the UK's most successful public sector coaches, Susan Moss, whose work coaching teenagers and teachers, is helping change the world of education for the better. Susan's advice will also be invaluable to coaches interested in working in the Public Sector. Then, in <em>Hot This Month</em>, we take a look at the Co-Active Network, which amongst the many forms of learning support we offer our students, represents the greatest opportunity for learning and collaboration. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">Finally, if you, a colleague, friend or client, is curious about Co-Active Coaching, then there are still some places left on our 2.5 day, Introduction to Co-Active Coaching course, The Fundamentals, in July. At &pound;375 (+VAT) this represents incredible value for money, regardless of whether you continue with our intermediate course or not. See Our Courses below, for more info, and to contact a program advisor. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">Where ever your career or personal development path is leading you, we wish you every success, and hope to see you on one of our courses soon. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">With best wishes,<br />
  <strong>The CTI UK Team.<br />

        <p class="style13 style29">One of the things our course participants are consistently surprised by, is the opportunity to connect with a community of like minded and equally inspired people.</p>
          <p class="style13 style29">The Co-Active community exists in many forms, from informal Local Groups who meet face to face monthly to the bi-annual European
            Co-Active Community day, but where it's has its greatest reach and deepest impact is the The Co-Active Network.</p>
      <p class="style13 style29">The Co-Active Network is set of relationships and resources, organised around niche communities, dedicated to exponentially enhancing the impact of Co-Active Coaching in the world.   These communities focus on everything from coaches working in education, to coaching mothers, and executive coaching</p>

<p class="style13 style29">Members of the Co-Active Network can come together both live and virtually to: 
Create learning, Share resources, Cultivate alliances, Develop opportunities, and
Build community, for the sake of forwarding and enhancing the lifelong process of human learning, effectiveness, and fulfilment.</p>

<p class="style13 style29">Uniquely, you do not have to have completed a CTI course to be a member.  
All Members receive a Basic Member Profile, full use of community bulletin boards and email, access to the communities’ on-line resource libraries, and the opportunity to participate in Network-sponsored live and virtual events.</p>

            <p class="style34"><br />
              <span class="style29">Human beings aren't solitary creatures. We thrive on our connections with one another, and those connections are what communication’s about. It's through communication that everything we achieve gets done, from opening a restaurant to flying to the moon to raising children. But while talk is easy, without the ability to listen keenly, communication goes nowhere.</span></p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Before coaching, if I'm honest, listening wasn't something I was very good at. I generally had plenty to say for myself, and a belief that everyone else was bound to be interested in my wisdom. This doesn't work when you're coaching, however, and so I've had to learn some lessons about listening. But the thing that's struck me most of all is that it's incredible what you can hear when you really listen.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Uniquely, in Co-Active Coaching, we talk about three levels of listening. What distinguishes them is where you focus as you listen to the person you're with.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Level One listening is listening primarily to yourself, or your own thoughts or agenda. You could be focusing on any number of things. Maybe you're thinking what to say next in the conversation, and so only half-hearing what the other person's saying. Maybe you're wondering what to have for lunch, or if you left the gas on. The key thing is that in Level One listening, you're not really fully hearing the other person.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">In Level Two listening you are intensely focused on what the other person is saying. Nothing's distracting you. Thoughts about the past or the future don't intrude. Even your own ideas don't get in the way of you hearing the other person. </p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Level Three listening is also completely directed towards the other person, but it has a wider focus. You hear more than just the words they're saying. You pick up on all sorts of other things - body language, the inflections and tone of their voice, their pauses and hesitations. It's like you can hear sound effects in their mind - the clink of a penny dropping, the thud as they hit a wall. You can feel them straining to avoid something, or pulling towards something - and you have a sense of what that might be.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">It's in Levels Two and Three that Co-Active Coaching take place. This is where you really let yourself be on the receiving end of someone else and their agenda.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Here's a simple experiment you can do to demonstrate the difference between listening Levels One, Two and Three.</p>
            
            <ol class="style29" style="line-height: 1.5em;">
            	<li class="style30">Get together with somebody else.</li>
                <li class="style30">Take a moment to think of something you really love - a particular interest or hobby perhaps, or a favourite book or film.</li>
                <li class="style30">Take it in turns to talk about the thing you love - for, say, 2 minutes. When you're listening, don't ignore the person, but don't let them hook you in either. Think about what you want to say on this subject, or let random thoughts distract you. When you're talking - and when you're listening too - notice what's like.</li>
                <li class="style30">Do it again, but this time, when you're listening, really focus. Be fascinated. Be alert to anything that makes you think &quot;Wow!&quot; or want to know more, however small or large.</li>
                <li class="style30">Do it a third time. When you're listening this time, try to be aware of what this feels like to the other person. Feel their energy. Notice the glint in their eye, the animation in their body language. Open up all your senses and be receptive to what the other person’s opening up to show you.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class="style13">This is an experiment you can repeat, varying and playing with it as you go. Try choosing different topics - things you hate, things of utter indifference. If you're feeling really ambitious, try really taking on Level Three listening by doing the exercise without talking - just use grunting, body language, whatever you like as long as you don't talk. See what you can hear then!</p>

      <strong>Tell us a bit about yourself, including what you did before you were a coach and what has brought you to coaching.</strong> </span>
      <br />
      <span class="style13 style29"> I have always been fascinated by human development.&nbsp; I’m endlessly curious and driven to learn, so have always been looking for new opportunities, to apply what I knew to have more impact in the world.&nbsp; So, after I graduated with a degree in psychology and a short career in human resources with a large retail business, I found my calling as a primary school teacher.</span>
	  <p class="style13 style29">
        I worked my way up and became a headmistress of a large faith school in North London.  It had its challenges, but not as many as the multi cultural school, I subsequently became headmistress of.  It was there that my work began to become more coach like -- although I didn’t know it at the time.</p>
	  <p class="style13 style29">
        Many of the children I was working with had been written off as failures, but I did a lot of values work with my team, to envision the kind of impact we wanted to have on these children.  We agreed that we wanted to create a safe and loving environment in which they could relax and learn without being in fear.  This had a massive impact on them academically, but also I believe it made them happier.  It also made the teachers happier too, because I supported them in doing their job in a way they felt was best for them.<br />
        <span class="style5 style12 style22"><br />
        <strong>What is the biggest personal breakthrough that you've had because of coaching?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        When I took the Co-Active Leadership Program about nine years ago, I felt like I had been steam cleaned on the inside!  During the program I discovered my unique voice, and learned to trust that what it told me was right.  Then, about a year after the course ended, I realised just how unhappy I was in my marriage.  Because of my training I was able to tell the truth about what I wanted from my marriage, while also accepting that even if I didn't get it, and the marriage ended, I would still be okay, or creative, resourceful and whole as Co-Active coaches call it.  That was so powerful, because it allowed me to transform a situation in my life, that might have become stagnant for so much longer.</span><br />



        <span class="style5 style12 style22">
        <br />
        <strong>You've developed a niche over the years coaching teenagers, how has this deepened your perspective on the Co-active Coaching model?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        Teenagers, when they are empowered to find their own answers and solve their own problems, make changes very quickly, and this reinforces that the same thing is possible with anyone, of any age, in any situation.</span><br />


        <span class="style5 style12 style22">
        <br />
        <strong>Tell us what it was like as an ex headteacher, to go back into a school setting as a coach?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        My antenna/sensitivity to the underlying communication problems, and lack of team work, and entrenched positions was now much sharper, and that was quite unsettling at first. I was sharply aware of the lack of co-activity in schools -- the ability to trust others and create understanding -  and this was upsetting for me.</span>	  </p>


	<p class="style13">
        And yet what is what drives me to carry out this work and continue to support schools to change, is the magic that happens when you support children and teachers, in having a more fulfilling education and worklife, by doing what's truly in their hearts.	  <br />
        <span class="style5 style12 style22"><br />
        <strong>What advice would you give to coaches looking to develop their niche in the public sector?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        Recognise the value that Co-Active Coaching truly offers.  Especially that it's economical, and can have a big impact on people in a relatively short number of sessions.<br />
        <br />
Get the professional qualification, such as a CPCC and display your letters on everything -- it is respected in the education business!<br />
<br />   
In education -- make sure you are CRB checked (criminal records bureau in the UK) so that you can work in a school. 
Offer some voluntary sessions if you can and use what results as testimonials, and especially consider working with others in the same field.<br />
<br />
Above all, follow the funding.  Invariably, there are already organisations set up to provide training, to the public sector, and they are more likely to get funding than a start-up.  So it may be easier therefore to align yourself with these organisations than try and apply for the funding yourself.</span><br />

      <span class="style13">
        Don't be a well kept secret!</span></p>


<p class="style13">
        Of course, the more obvious marketing channels such as networking at conferences, local business groups, writing articles for local press, and doing radio interviews, are valuable, but don't underestimate the value of public speaking.	  </p>
	  <p class="style13">
        Speaking is just coaching in public -- you have so many tools already from the CTI courses that you can use in a group setting.  Offering free talks to any of the 1000s of groups, clubs and societies out there is a great way of getting your name established.	  </p>
      <p class="style13">
        In the public sector, you may like to offer free sample sessions at national conferences, but instead call them 'coaching clinics'.  This is a great way of getting larger projects -- as opposed to individual clients.  I once won a &pound;10K plus contract as a result of one of these clinics.	  <br />
        <br />

        <span class="style5 style12 style22">
        <strong>What's your greatest client success story?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        What a question!</span>	  </p>
      <p class="style34"><span class="style29">
        I must be too modest as this is hard to complete.   A recent success was a young man of 17 who got his teachers to sit down and listen to him while he explained the way he learned best, while also asking them to help him by slowing down and reinforcing the learning points -- to which they agreed.  He set the agenda, set the whole thing up without his parents, spoke from his heart -- and essentially reversed the relationship by asking for what he wanted. Brave -- huh!</span>	  <br />
        <span class="style5 style12 style22"><br />
        <strong>What's your greatest client failure story and what did I learn from it?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        I was coaching a team of six senior teachers at a secondary school, and they had a new head teacher who could see the reluctance amongst the staff to change.  I coached everyone individually, and the results were very mixed.  There was a great impact with 4 of them, but 2 were just so entrenched in their position, they wouldn't change.	  </span>
        <span class="style29"><br />
	    </span>      </p>
      
      
<p class="style13">
        What this highlighted for me in group coaching, including in the business sector, is the need to ensure that all participants are willing to engage -- and are not just showing up, because they have been told too.  It's your responsibility as a coach to do your due diligence here, because when even just one member of the group is holding back, it can scupper your overall impact on the team.	  </p>
      <p class="style13">
        If someone else is paying for the coaching, other than the client, be absolutely sure who is accountable to whom, and how confidentiality is going to be held and honoured.	  </p>
      <p class="style13">
        This is an important part of my work with teenagers too.  I make it clear with parents who pay for the sessions, before they decide to sign up, that I can't report back to them about the teenager, and that a way must be established in which the teenager will be able to feedback directly to their parents.<br />
        <br />

        <span class="style5 style12 style22">
        <strong>You are one of CTI UKs mentors, what do you enjoy about that role? </strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13 style29">
        I love being able to use the Co-Active model to help people do the practical things they need to do to become powerful and successful coaches, like finding their niche, marketing, structuring events to publicise your work, and how to deal with difficult client problems, ethics.</span>	  </p>
      
      
      <p class="style13 style29">
        The focus of the mentoring service is to help people get going again when they've got stuck, or get out of the blocks when they haven't even started.  I'm always amazed at just quickly people breakthrough and re-ignite their passion for what they want to create in the world.	  <br />
        <br />



        <span class="style5 style12 style22">
        <strong>If you had 1 minute to advise someone considering a career in coaching, what would you tell them?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        You will learn a set of skills that are totally portable, applicable in numerous life situations, personal and professional, to help people change their lives, and achieve fulfilment according to their values.  This in itself is immensely fulfilling and energising work to do!<br />
        </span><span class="style5 style12 style22"><br />
        <strong>What is the one piece of advice about starting a career as a coach that you wish you had been given?</strong> </span>
        <br />
        <span class="style13">
        Keep really thorough client records, hours and testimonials for gaining professional awards such as PCC.</span>        </p>
<p class="style13"><span class="style29">
        Also you MUST get professional indemnity insurance -- I use Towergate.</span><span class="style29"></span><span class="style30"><br />

        <strong>What do you like to do for fun?</strong> </span>

            <span class="style29">At CTI UK we offer a<span class="style22"><strong> free 1 on 1 telephone mentoring</strong></span> service to all of our current and past graduates who have done or who are currently taking the Core Curriculum of Co-Active Coach Training with us (i.e. Fundamentals through to In The Bones).</span></p>
            <p class="style13 style29">The service has become increasingly popular with our graduates.  If you haven't yet used the service and are eligible to, please do!  This is how it works:<br />
            The calls are one-on-one 30 minute telephone sessions with Senior Coaches; coaches who've been there and done it and can help developing coaches to explore ideas and learn from their experience of developing both as a coach and business owner.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">We've covered everything from supporting new coaches in developing their business, to ideas for how to design workshops, to helping coaches learn and develop from difficult calls with their clients.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">The only thing you pay for is the cost of the call to them as you would do with your coach and Mentoring is available to you at any time during or after your training.</p>
            <p class="style29">Here is what one of the coaches using the Mentoring Service, had to say about it:<br />
            <em>&quot;I recently took on something that was a big step up for <br />
            me - leading a workshop at a conference. CTI Mentoring service was absolutely instrumental in preparing me for <br />
            this and ensuring it went off very well. &nbsp;What made it really powerful was that she simultaneously gave me her own input and had me draw on my own resources. I felt I was working from a platform we created together with her expert guidance. I'm very grateful for the major boost it gave me. It's taken my practice in several new directions.&quot;</em></p>
            <p class="style13 style29">To book a mentoring call simply email <a href="mailto:jacky@thecoaches.com" class="style22" style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>jacky@thecoaches.com</strong></a> or call us on 0845 299 8199 and you can book an available time slot.&nbsp; Please note that you are not assigned a specific mentor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your calls may be with the same mentor or not, depending on yours and their availability.</p>
