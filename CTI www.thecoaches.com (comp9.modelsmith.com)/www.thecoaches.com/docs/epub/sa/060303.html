 <blockquote>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“I adored this course—it was the best! The content is amazing, and the leader is brilliant—she creates such learning and opportunity and safety and leaning into…” (A.S.) </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“I will be more confident about my unique offering (me!) and more intentional about how I want to market myself…you can’t help but be inspired to implement the tips and ideas.“ (M.D.) </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“The classes themselves [had] great wisdom that came from everywhere. I had one ‘aha’ on a class that has changed my marketing habits forever AND I am having much more fun!” (K.K.) </p>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">“I now believe that I can make growing my business a part of running my business. Before, I always saw them as separate activities.” (P.B.) </p>
