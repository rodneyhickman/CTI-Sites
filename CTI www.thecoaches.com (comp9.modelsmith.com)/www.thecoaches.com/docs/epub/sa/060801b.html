      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">CTI&rsquo;s core coaching curriculum consists of five in-person, experiential weekend programmes that provide strong grounding and practice in the principles of Co-Active coaching, within a limited class size of 26.

They consistently receive rave reviews in student curriculum evaluations.
