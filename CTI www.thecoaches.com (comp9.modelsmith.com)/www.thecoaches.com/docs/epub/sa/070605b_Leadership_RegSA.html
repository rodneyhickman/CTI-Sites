	  <p>Greetings,</p>
	  <p>You are receiving this personal invitation because you were identified by one of our course leaders as a perfect candidate for our Summer Leadership program. The Leadership program is a great opportunity to strengthen your natural leadership talents, and it just happens that our summer courses still have a few spaces available.</p>
	  <p>We understand the summer months can be a very busy time. To encourage you to take a second look at your summer calendar, we'd like to offer you an incentive. </p>
	  <p><strong>Special Offer</strong><br>
	    In September, CTI will be piloting its newest program: Quest--A Leader's Journey.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>Designed to &quot;build muscle around clarity,&quot; this powerful program helps leaders identify their true purpose and move forward with confidence and grace by answering the questions: </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Who Am I?</strong> &quot;<em>An exploration of your      authentic self&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>Where Am I Going?</strong>&nbsp; <em>&quot;The compelling path that pulls you forward&quot;</em></li>
	    <li><strong>How Do I Get There?</strong> <em>&quot;Bringing your sense of      purpose to the world&quot;</em></li>
      </ul>
	  <p>In addition to your $500.00 gift certificate, if you register for one of our Summer Leadership programs (June, July and August), you can attend the September 14-16, 2007, Quest pilot for <strong><em>FREE </em></strong>(Open enrollment for the Quest program will be priced at $1,500.00).</p>
	  <p><strong>Act Now</strong><br>
	    This offer ends June 19, so please do not delay. To assist you in your decision, the Summer Leadership program dates are listed below.</p>
	  <p>To register, simply <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/leadership/contact-form-9285.html" title="blocked::http://www.thecoaches.com/coaching/contact-form-2734.html" target="_blank" class="orange">click here</a>, enter your contact information, and a CTI program advisor will contact you to discuss your options and answer any questions you may have.</p>
