            <p>Increasingly the standard that sets top-performing businesses, executives and entrepreneurs apart is the ability to quickly turn strategy into action. This new reality is creating opportunities for coaches to engage internally with organizations. </p>
            <p>Research information on the coaching industry is not always easy to come by. We, at CTI, were excited about finding an extensive study on the past, present and future trends of coaching. We wanted to make sure you, our coaching community, were aware of this study. And, the best part is, itâ€™s available as a free download!<br />

            <p>&quot;COACHING: A Global Study of Successful Practices&quot; <br />
            ~ <em></em>American Management Association </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>Everyone is familiar with coaching. Over the centuries, the value of coaching has been established in sports in the skills and attitude of athletes. In the twentieth century, it became a practice in companies--specifically, a responsibility of managers to address the work performance of staff. Increasingly, however, companies are utilizing it to address the career and job needs of their senior executives, and they reach outside for coaches. Because coaching is now recognized as an integral element in leadership development, there is increasing interest in its best practices. <strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/sa/080807_CoachingStudy_AMA.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to read full study</a>.</strong></em></p>
