            CTI UK's quarterly email newsletter!<br />
          </h1>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Greetings CTI Community, </p>
 
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><em> </em>Every new year, we often feel impelled to make New Year's resolutions: to lose weight, work less, play more.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with making commitments like this, yet how often do they weigh us down with the burden of expectation?  <br />
            <br />
            Perhaps this need to make New Year's resolutions is simply a mask for a deeper desire to create our life afresh with a new perspective, a new experience or a change of scenery.<br />
            That's what all our content in this edition points to. <br />
            <br />
            In &quot;Hot This Month,&quot; there are details about our new UK coach training venue in <strong>Manchester</strong>. There's news of another chance for CPCCs to take CTI's newest offering, the <strong>Leadership Circle Profile</strong>, as well as news of a fresh start for CTI UK's Local Group initiative. <br />
            <br />
            As one of the UK's most publicised and successful coaches without a clearly defined niche, <strong>Karen Ali</strong>, our profiled coach this edition, will offer fresh inspiration to  coaches who think they need to reinvent the wheel to make it. <br />
            <br />
            Our featured articles offer graduates, established coaches and the simply curious, fresh perspectives to enrich any coaching practice. <strong>Tony Barton</strong> discusses how to take coaching lightly and still serve your client, while <strong>Beth Follini</strong> and <strong>Ursula Glunk</strong> explore how to stay with the tension that comes with holding the polarities of coaching and life at the same time. <br />
            <br />
            Over the last 15 years, CTI has been a new beginning for tens of thousands of people, and so if you too, are looking for a new experience, or point of view, we hope to see you in one of our courses in 2010.</p>

              <br />
              To celebrate this move, we are offering a special promotional price of just &pound;275 (+VAT) on our inaugural introductory coach training course, <em>The Fundamentals</em> -- a saving of &pound;100 on the normal price of &pound;375 (+VAT). <br />
              <br />
              <em>The Fundamentals</em> is by far the best way of experiencing the rigorous coaching model, the thorough content and the deeply experiential learning style that has made Co-active Coaching so successful, enjoyed by more than 20,000 managers, consultants and new career seekers worldwide.<br />
              <br />
              <em>The Fundamentals</em> will be hosted at <a href="http://www.thelowry.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Lowry Arts and Entertainment</strong></a>, a magnificent venue located in the recently redeveloped Salford Quays, less than10 minutes from central Manchester and major rail networks. <br />
              <br />

		   <p  style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> Following our successful inaugural presentation of <strong>The Leadership Circle</strong> in November, CTI  is delighted to present this groundbreaking course again in Boston, USA, 23 - 25 March.  While that may sound too far for some,  with  flights available for as little as &pound;300, this course is still very accessible for any CPCC who wants to acquire one of the business world's leading 360-degree feedback instruments to enhance their practice. <br />
		     <br />
		     TLC is the only 360-degree feedback instrument that measures the two primary leadership domains -- Creative Competencies and Reactive Tendencies -- and integrates this information so that the key opportunities for development immediately rise to the surface.<br />
		     <br />
		     By empowering the Co-active conversation with the science in TLC's framework, something completely new and profound is created in the marketplace.<br />
		     <br />
		     The value created for the client is so powerful that TLC-certified coaches are seeing their training investment returned within their initial few engagements. If your coaching practice includes corporate clientele or you are looking for a path into that lucrative market, we invite you to become a part of our charter group of organisational and leadership transformation architects. <br />
		     <br />
		     &quot;<em>The Leadership Circle Profile stands head and shoulders above all the rest! It is user-friendly, statistically stunning and based solidly on both the leadership and development literatures. This is a tool for anyone who is committed to injecting evidence into your leadership conversations with your clients and teams.</em>&quot; <strong> -- Deborah Colman MCC, CPCC</strong><br />
		     <br />
		     Claim your place now for our 23 - 25 March course and take advantage of this opportunity to position yourself to coach on the cutting edge of leadership transformation in organisations.<br />

		             <p  style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> Regular readers of our newsletter will know that it's almost two years since we launched our UK Local Groups Initiative.  Since then, hundreds of coaches nationwide have taken the opportunity to come together in person, on a regular basis, to practice, revise and celebrate Co-active Coaching.  <br />
		     <br />
		     However, during the summer, CTI UK decided,  since the initiative was now firmly established, to hand over its overarching coordination to the Co-active community itself. In October, Sue Belton, CPCC, and a former BBC TV Producer stepped forward to lead the UK Co-active Local Groups Community.<br />
		     <br />
		     She says: &quot;When I finished Core Curriculum, it would have been very easy to just go off and trudge along on my own. But being part of a Local Group has made a huge difference to my early days as a coach. I've felt cared for, I've got a group of people I can call on when I need help, and I've been able to be there for others, too. My aim for the Local Group Network is for  every single person coming out of Core Curriculum -- wherever they live -- to have access to a group. Why do it on your own, when it can be easy and so much more enjoyable!&quot;<br />
		     <br />
	        Sue's first task has been to collate information about the initiative on the Co-Active Network. If you're new to the initiative, then simply click <strong><a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com/webx/.59c27677" target="_blank">here</a></strong>            to view a list of Local Group coordinators and the areas they cover.

      &quot;Coaches Can Fly When They Take Themselves Lightly&quot;</span><span class="style12"><br />

      <tr><td width="620" rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px;">
           
            <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">I love the saying that angels can fly because they take themselves lightly. But how about coaches?  What would change if you took yourself lightly in your coaching?<br />
              <br />
              What would be different in your coaching relationships if it wasn't quite so serious?<br />
              <br />
              It's not that I don't take coaching or my clients seriously. To me, there is nothing more serious than a life well lived. It's just that life is full of contrasts: light and shade, tears and laughter, up and down. It's the yin and yang of life that makes coaching (and living) so amazing. <br />
              <br />
              So if you have made up that coaching is a serious business and that, in order to be good, you'd better take it seriously and be a seriously good coach...here are some tips you might like to experiment with on your next coaching call. It may be best not to deploy them all at once -- to bring your own essence of lightness to your coaching practice. See what happens -- you might be surprised -- they may help your client fly!<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Imagine you're a 4-year-old child. Ask the questions a 4-year-old would ask (and you'll have to break the rules here because a lot of 4-year-old questions are going to be &quot;Why?&quot; followed by &quot;Why?&quot; and then, for good measure just to make sure, &quot;Why?&quot; again! But don't limit yourself to 'Why?' Kids have amazing imaginations and endless curiosity, so bring that energy and wonder to your coaching as well. What would a 4-year-old ask about changing careers, about a relationship breakdown, about trying to find some meaning in life?<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Play with your client. Design with them that you want to bring more playfulness into your coaching. This way, you get their permission and you'll both be 'in the playground,' as it were.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Ask them questions such as, &quot;If this was a game, what are the rules you've made up?&quot; or &quot;How can we play with this?&quot; or &quot;OK so now I want you to outrageously exaggerate this issue/problem/ challenge -- really get dramatic about it and let's see what happens.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Ask them to explore the 'It's funny' perspective of whatever it is they're struggling with.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Break out of the business-as-usual mode, mix things up, play with your coaching tools -- skip around a balance wheel, light up your client like a Christmas tree with their values, dive deep into their process like a submarine in <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em>!<br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Let go of being professional and competent! No really, trust that you are professional and competent and allow yourself full permission not to have to prove it in every coaching session. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>=&gt;</strong> Try talking to yourself in the mirror before a challenging coaching session and tell yourself to be REALLY, REALLY GOOD TODAY until you start to see the funny side of just how seriously you're taking yourself -- and then pull a few very silly faces at yourself for good measure. Wear a silly hat to coach in to remind you of the lightness.<br />
              <br />
              Are you getting the idea?<br />
              <br />
              A lot of the coaching we do is about helping our clients move on in their lives because, along the way, they got stuck for whatever reason. By shifting our energy and way of being from seriousness to lightness, we can help them get unstuck. But first we have to unstick ourselves. <br />
              <br />
              Coaching is a wonderfully creative art, so challenge yourself to use all your creativity in service of your client's magnificence. To do otherwise is to allow your ego and your professionalism to get in the way -- and that really is silly!<br />

<strong>
        Tell us a bit about yourself, including what you did before you were a coach</strong>.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">I graduated from University with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Management,   which is not really people-focused.  But via jobs at British Aerospace and the Hay Group, where I led a diagnostic team charged with analysing surveys focused on different management styles and the impact they had on the company culture, I got a great schooling in leadership, group dynamics and what motivates people to change.  It was at this point I realised that what I loved was seeing people transition through change and how to communicate with people in a way that wins hearts and minds.  So I successfully applied for a job at  a top change consultant.  I found my job interesting, despite the travel, but in 2001, I was made redundant without any warning whatsoever.  It was the biggest setback of my career.  I felt complete despair.   HR was completely clinical, and I found myself sobbing uncontrollably after realising I was being made redundant, instead of being called into the office to talk about a new project I was going to be on.  I called my husband, who, hearing that I was in such a state of shock, assumed I ‘d been in a car accident, as he was trying to make sense of what I was saying in between my sobs.  The news of a redundancy was a relief compared to what he thought had happened!<br />
            <br />
            I'd always been fast-tracked in my career, and so quickly fell into a spiral of doubt and thinking that I wasn't good enough. I had never experienced this feeling before and wanted the earth to swallow me up. However, a friend recommended the classic book <em>What Colour Is My Parachute?</em> which, at first glance, seemed ‘Americanised.' But after working through it systematically, and recognising my love of working with people in transition, I first considered being a counsellor or a psychiatrist. However, life coaching caught my eye and I decided to look for a training course.<br />
            <br />
            CTI was on a short list of two, and I chose it because it was the only one that offered in-person training.          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What is the biggest personal breakthrough that you've had because of coaching?</strong></p>            
			<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">I hired a coach during my training course with CTI, and one of the things we worked on was my doubt about making money. <br />
            <br />
            I had taken a job again as a consultant and was trying to build my practice in my spare time, and it was leaving very little time for living. I worked with my coach to delegate some of the more practical parts of my life, so I would have more balance in my life. I remember even asking our cleaner to do something simple, like cook an evening meal, was a huge breakthrough.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What has surprised you most about Co-active coaching?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">The robustness of the model, especially Process coaching, where coaches learn how to help clients work through emotionally-charged issues. I've learnt that you don't have to put a plaster on emotions, you can meet people where they are without making them right or wrong. You can simply acknowledge what they are feeling. <br />
            <br />
              It allows for a richer experience. It enables me to deal with people's emotions effectively -- rather than collude with the client to hurry them up, or even cover them up. I'm always surprised by how clients sometimes apologise for showing emotion in the coaching session -- and yet Process coaching opens a doorway to so much learning. Without it, it would be easy for a coach to let a client get away with paying lip service to what was happening in their life, with some platitude like, ‘Oh things will be better tomorrow.' </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>In spite of the received wisdom that you should focus on a niche as a coach, you have been very successful by offering a wide range of coaching services. Tell us more about how you've gone about this.</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">It's not a matter of either or. Both ways work. Having said that, I've not gone out of my way to develop a range of coaching services, but simply developed them in response to what clients ask me for. Confidence is a theme that links all my services together, but I don't want to be pigeonholed as a ‘confidence' coach, because it could potentially take away the surprise and wonder of discovering that confidence was at the root of a client's transformation. Pigeonholing yourself can  make marketing your business easier, but it can also make it harder, resulting in the loss of clients who would otherwise be happy to work with you.<br />
            <br />
            My main advice is that there is no true formula. Don't necessarily try and replicate what other successful coaches have done, but experiment and listen to the feedback, and stay with what works. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>You've succeeded in building alliances with other companies in the personal development field, such as the Mind Gym. What's the key to success here?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Alliances are a great way to not only supplement your income, but provide you with a predictable income, which can help you with forward planning. I would recommend seeking out companies that have a synergy with your values. Third-party alliances can provide you with a wonderful shop window, which you would otherwise have to pay for, so be flexible and open to negotiate your fees. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What's your greatest client success story?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Someone who worked in the city of London, who didn't think they were coachable, was very cynical at the outset, but at the end of nine months had completely transformed. They were a complete coaching convert and left their job to embark on a wild, extreme adventure, which challenged them mentally, physically and spiritually in a way that made them realise they could achieve anything. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What's your greatest client failure story and what did you learn from it?</strong> </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">A client who said to me they ‘didn't think they were getting value for money.' That's like the kiss of death for a coach, but instead of letting it deflate me, I ‘kissed it back,' and asked them, ‘What do you want from the coaching that's different?' I realised that in situations like that you have to be willing to ask the client what's missing, and if you can deliver it, do so, but if not then be willing to let them go. Don't be attached to getting it right or wrong. Be O.K with whatever happens.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>You have achieved an enviable amount of media coverage. What tips can you offer coaches seeking wider publicity?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">There will always be someone in your network of friends and colleagues who knows someone who knows someone who works in the media, and so network as much as you can to get your first piece of publicity in a publication that is well indexed online. That's the key, as journalists tend to use past coverage for their research. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>How has being a mother changed your life and perspective as a coach?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">I'm even more flexible when appointments change at the last minute. I've discovered new levels of patience in my life and, through my children, just how deeply curious you can be. It's not about right or wrong, just experience -- learning that when we do something, there is a response to our actions. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What advice would you give to people about to take the Fundamentals course? How can they get the most out of it?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Have an open mind, and be willing to use your own life as a resource for the coaching exercises you do. If you do, you'll walk away from the course with incredible personal development. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>If you had 10 minutes to advise someone considering a career in coaching, what would you say?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Find out what it is exactly about coaching that you're passionate about, by being coached yourself. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What advice would you give new coaches just starting out in their career looking to build their practice?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Be totally transparent about your lack of experience, but don't give your services away for free. Always charge a nominal fee. And, at the same time, don't mix up your value as a coach with the amount you charge or the number of clients you have. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What is the one piece of advice about starting a career as a coach that you wish you had been given?</strong> </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">That it involves a lot of work. Being highly skilled as a coach is not enough, you must be willing to be a businessperson too. It's not enough to be the best restaurant in town, if no one knows about you.<br />
            <br />
              Own who you are, and be who you are in your sample sessions. For example, I'm very clear with people from the outset that, in addition to being very supportive, I'm also provocative and willing to challenge people where they are stuck. I'm not for the faint-hearted! It's better they know what you are like from the outset. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What do you do for fun and tell us how that makes you a better coach!?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Dance, dance, dance. I go to a dance class called Dance Fever, where we work with a choreographer, who leads us in dance sequences from musicals and pop videos, but not too seriously. We recently did the Beyonce video, ‘Single Ladies.' It was so much fun. It reminds me to not take myself seriously, and that I don't have to be the best at everything that I do.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; color: #5D87A1;"><strong>What's your most outrageous ambition (that we can print) both personally and as a coach?</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">              To be a backing dancer on a pop video. To begin to employ associates.<br />

	  <p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">by Ursula Glunk and Beth Follinin</p>
          
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <em>True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself.<br />
		    True fullness seems empty, yet it is fully present.</em><br />
		    -- Tao Te Ching</p>
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      Polarities are inter-dependent opposites that show up everywhere in life: connection vs. autonomy; introvert vs.  extrovert; being vs.  doing, uniqueness vs.  conformity. As coaches, we become aware of polarities in our clients' lives when they struggle with either/or choices, when, in fact, the road to wholeness is to learn to stay with the tension that comes with holding both poles at the same time. </p>
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      Once you start looking through the lens of polarities, you find them at the heart of the Co-active model and the coaching relationship itself. The ability of coaches to understand polarity tensions in their own work, to make them transparent, and to simultaneously hold opposing poles, will not only make their coaching more effective but also model to their clients how to deal with polarities. The coaching relationship entails ambiguities and tensions; if this is not the case, the coaching becomes flat and uninspired. The metaphor of a seesaw can best illustrate this relationship. As coaches, we are in charge of keeping the seesaw in movement; depending on the 'weight' of the other person, we have to adjust our own position, leaning towards one direction or the other, allowing for the complementarities of opposing forces.</p>
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      In the following we will describe three interrelated sets of polarities that coaches have to be comfortable with to keep the seesaw of the coaching relationship in movement.</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><strong> Safety and courage.</strong> Coaches have two seemingly opposing tasks: They have to create a safe space where clients feel free to show up just as they are and, at the same time, they have to continuously challenge them to stretch their boundaries, to look beyond their usual frames of reference and to discover where they betray themselves. This demands from the coach the ability to confront the client while, at the same time, offering empathy and unconditional positive regard.<br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>Encouraging self-acceptance and encouraging change. </strong>Some clients come to the coaching with excessive demands of self-improvement, which can almost be a form of self-hatred. Here, coaches need to lean into the pole of positive sponsoring and self-acceptance in order to create meaningful change. Other clients are so reluctant to explore new territories that the coach has to lean more into the pole of change for opening up new areas for the client to increase self-acceptance.<br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">  <strong>Deepening the learning and forwarding the action.</strong> This polarity is closely related to discovery and direction, reflection and action, not-knowing and knowing. The coach has to decide when the client is best served by nondirective deep explorations, with the coach listening curiously and openly, and when the coach's direction towards concrete action is needed.</li>
		    </ol>		  
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      If the space does not allow for these opposites, the coaching becomes shallow, predictable or even frozen and the coaching relationship suffers. Within the Co-active Coaching model, the balance between opposing forces is addressed explicitly and supports coaches to monitor their coaching relationships in this respect. This allows us to explore our own preferences concerning these poles, so that we can model to our clients what it means to hold opposing truths. </p>
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      The question emerges: How do we as coaches hold the tension between two interdependent opposites? And how can we work with clients and support them in engaging with paradoxical tensions? We describe the process based on a simplified version of &quot;The Polarity Engagement Model&quot; as developed by The Polarity Pathway Group. This model allows coaches to support their clients in discovering and transcending the boundaries of either/or thinking.</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"> <strong>Developing awareness.</strong> This is the first and most important step to engaging with polarity. In this step, clients identify a polarity that currently plays a role in their life. Perhaps they notice that they are feeling extreme irritation or frustration. Often polarities show themselves when we are projecting feelings onto other people. Through developing awareness of how polarities show up, the clients become attuned to the nuances of the polarity. <br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">  <strong>Exploring each pole.</strong> At this stage, the client explores what is good and also what is not so good about each pole. What serves the client here? What does not serve the client? Is there a preferred pole? If so, what is it like to step over and explore the rejected pole? <br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">  <strong>Softening the boundaries. </strong>At this stage, the client starts to understand what has been holding the two poles apart. The concept of the boundary keeper is introduced. Through dialoguing with the boundary keeper, the client can loosen the separation of the poles, and the rigid boundary can transform into a more fluid line. Enabling the client to visualise the boundary keeper is a helpful and necessary device for engaging into dialogue. The idea in this step is not to banish or attack the boundary keepers -- rather it is to honour them for their work and release them from their duties.<br />
		      <br />
		    </li>
		    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">  <strong>Journey towards transcendence.</strong> This final step naturally flows from the work with the boundary keeper. The client is invited to return to the poles and to look at both at the same time,  noticing what it feels like to hold both and what has shifted, for instance, if one pole was favoured. What is it like to hold ambition and relaxation at the same time? Where is the space of connected autonomy? How is letting go important for control? This final step is crucial because it points to the transformative nature of working with polarity. </li>
		    </ol>		  
		  <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">		      This process of learning to 'hold the paradox' is never complete. Part of the beauty of life, we believe, is in its human-ness -- it is a reflection upon the struggle to develop and grow. So, also as coaches, we will never reach the space beyond paradoxical tensions. Coaches show their strength in their willingness to be vulnerable and by making their own struggles with polarities transparent. Going through this process with supervisors or peers gives the coach a new expansiveness and the ability to hold the tension between interrelated opposites in service of the client. </p>
