		  <h1 class="style4">Welcome to CTI UK's <br />
            July 2009 Newsletter<br />
          </h1>
          <p class="style13 style29">Dear Friend, </p>
 
          <p class="style13 style29">Welcome to the July 2009 edition of CTI UK's Coaches and Graduates email newsletter. In this issue, we explore the theme of community which has been, and continues to be, so important to the growth of Co-active coaching worldwide. </p>

          <p class="style13 style29">At CTI, we believe that global connectivity doesn't have to come at the expense of local cohesiveness. Indeed, for the Co-active community to flourish, our students and graduates need be able to network with their peers in other countries via the Internet, as well as being able to identify who they can connect with locally in person. </p>     

<p class="style13 style29">In this month's featured articles, we explore two CTI initiatives that have meant CTI students and graduates can have both.</p>  

<p class="style13 style29">In our article about the Co-active Network, we look at CTI's online platform through which students, graduates and experienced coaches can network with a vast range of people representing different views and geographies. Then, in our look at CTI UK's Local Groups initiative, we report on how coaches across the UK have been renewing their passion for Co-active coaching by increasing the face-to-face contact they have with each other.</p>

<p class="style13 style29">Elsewhere, you will find some advance information about a new CTI course for CPCCs that we hope to present in the UK this autumn.</p>

<p class="style13 style29">Finally, we still have places left in our September Fundamentals Introduction to Co-active coaching course, so if there's someone at a turning point in their life who you think would benefit from this life-changing course, please do refer them to us. At Â£375 (+VAT), this 2.5-day course represents incredible value for the price. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">Please email Judy at <a href="mailto:judy@thecoaches.com">judy@thecoaches.com</a> or phone +44 (0)845 299 8199. </p>

<p class="style13 style29">Wishing you every success in your coaching career,<br />

            <p class="style34"><br />
              <span class="style29">The Co-active Network was born out of CTI's Business Development Program in 2003. The vision was to support and champion Co-active coaches and leaders to achieve their greatest impact in the world by enhancing the lifelong process of human learning, effectiveness and fulfillment.</span></p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Susan Moss, CPCC, was part of the Business Development Program that set up the Co-active Network. She says: "We realised that if we were going to teach coaches about how to find their niche, we also needed to offer them somewhere to explore their niche and network with each other. We realised this would be key in helping coaches explore the many different ways that coaching could be applied and shown to be relevant."</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Although social networking was still in its infancy at the time, CTI took the bold step in developing a multi-platform website, with messaging, forums, free conference lines, calendars and opportunity to create niche newsletters. It was an essential tool that coaches and people interested in coaching and leadership, could use to come together to create learning, share resources, cultivate alliances, develop opportunities and build community niches.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Since 2003, the opportunity to talk to other professionals in their area regardless of geography has proven very attractive to CTI's students and graduates. Today, the Co-active Network has more than 14,000 members and is still growing. The network's niche communities cover almost every subject and application of coaching, from social action to Christian coaches to youth leadership to coaches working with emotional intelligence.  </p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Susan Moss' example as co-founder and leader of the education niche shows the network really can inspire coaches to do more than just have enlightened discussion. </p>
            <p class="style13 style29">"I had just completed my Leadership Program, and I saw this as a chance to express my leadership by spreading Co-Activity in education," she says. "Coaching in schools is often equated with mentoring or coaching in the traditional sense, such as coaching sports teams, so we made a deliberate intention to invite people from the education world to present to our niche. We learnt from them, and at the same time they were exposed to Co-activity.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">"I've met amazing coaches with whom I've been able to have great conversations about the education system and how coaching can make it fit for purpose. The global reach of the education niche, which now has hundreds of members, means my learning opportunity has been so much richer."</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">Nine members of the education niche have recently written an e-book together to make what they have learned more widely available. Titled <em>Turning the Corner in Education: A Global Perspective</em>, the book's diverse content explores what's happening in the world of education worldwide and reflects the power of the Co-active Network to deepen coaches' learning through exposure to a wider range of perspectives. For example, in her chapter, Dr. Linda Lea describes how she brought coaching and leadership skills to young women in Tanzania who previously had not been given a voice, opening up opportunities available to them in education.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">There are still numerous areas yet to be represented by a niche community on the Co-active Network, so if you feel inspired, now is your moment. Indeed, if you have found it difficult to get your career as a coach started, this might be the opportunity you need to make your mark.</p>
            <p class="style13 style29">If you feel called forth to step up as a Niche Community Leader, Susan Moss makes the following recommendations:</p>
            <ol class="style29" style="line-height: 1.5em;">
            	<li class="style30">Consider if your idea for a niche will be a good place for coaches to find work, practice their skills, meet colleagues and/or deepen their learning. </li>
                <li class="style30">Be ready to commit your time as a niche leader, to both connect with other leaders in your niche and other leaders within the community, to discuss how the Co-active Network is evolving. </li>
                <li class="style30">Have a minimum level of computer literacy.</li>
                <li class="style30">Be very open about how the niche is going to evolve. It will grow through the co-activity of the group you pull together and not necessarily conform to your seed vision.</li>
            </ol>

      <br />
      </span><span class="style13 style29"> When we started our Local Groups initiative at CTI UK in Spring 2008, our initiative was simply to encourage coaches inspired to increase the face-to-face contact they had with each other by taking their own initiative in setting up local Co-active coaching support groups.</span>
	  <p class="style13 style29">
        For a profession that is increasingly becoming virtualized, we sensed that this would help coaches either bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly, to renew their passion for Co-active coaching in a way they might not have experienced since training as a coach. </p>
	  <p class="style13 style29">
        From this small seed, the response has been far greater than we could have ever imagined.</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">As Kate Jones, who runs the North West Local Group reflects: &quot;It feels fantastic! There is a lot of fondness in the group; huge amounts of creativity, great minds, great questions, (GREAT COACHES including those who have 'only' done Fundamentals), real honesty and transparency, vulnerability from time to time, sanity and insanity checks...there is room for everything! Co-activity is alive and well and thriving in the North West.&quot;</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">Isabel Van der Ven, of the Beautiful South Coaches Network adds: &quot;It was the extra dimension you get when being face-to-face, as most of us spend most time behind the computer and on the phone. On our first day, we had a quiz, speed coaching (!), had FUN, worked on building/expanding your business and had a 'swap-shop' to connect people helping each other on any topic related to coaching.&quot;</p>
        <p class="style13 style29"><strong>Set your purpose clearly</strong><br />
  Over the last 15 months, some 20 people have stepped forward as local coordinators, covering nearly every area of the UK. Their experience -- trials, successes and errors -- has provided immense learning which we hope will make the way a little easier for those who follow in their footsteps.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style13 style29">What we have noticed in talking to the different coordinators is that those who have clearly articulated their purpose have found it much easier to engage others.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style13 style29">Judy Rich of the NW London Group says that their group is &quot;a place to share our uniqueness as coaches and be recognised for it.&quot;</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">This may be simply stating the obvious, and yet, as many of us know, it's all too easy to forget. Indeed, a clearly defined purpose might be the difference between creating a dynamic support group in which coaches can grow and learn and simply creating a space for &quot;tea and chat&quot; (although that too is important!)&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style13 style29"><strong>Form and structure</strong><br />
          While some groups found their feet almost from day one, others have started and then merged with others, some started and then closed, while others are still waiting for sufficient numbers to come forth.</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">Judy Rich of the North West London Coaching group says that the smaller size of their group (12, of which any 6-8 regularly meet) means they can meet in each other's houses and retain a level of intimacy and committment.</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">But, as Jude Jennison of the Midlands Co-active Community Group says, sometimes you need to be willing to experiment until you find the right format that will allow your group to gel: &quot;The Midlands community tried to get together one evening, but for whatever reason never succeeded to meet. So in the true spirit of co-activity, we tried a different tack -- a day out in the Malvern Hills. With packed lunches, a dog and a dose of sunshine, a great day was had by all. It's amazing how fresh air and a change in perspective make a difference to how we view things.&quot; </p>
        <p class="style13 style29"><strong>Commitment</strong><br />
  While getting the numbers and format right is important, it seems patience is a key ingredient in the creation of lasting local community.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style13 style29">As Kate Jones adds: &quot;Do encourage others not to give up hope. There were a couple of meetings when there were only three of us, and yet the energy still held. It takes time for the system that is the community to develop. It takes holding on to your vision big time, commitment, time, persistence, patience, tenacity and more time!&quot;</p>
        <p class="style13 style29">Sometimes, this can also mean being willing to open up the ownership of the group to the members themselves. For example, a number of coordinators have reported that while initial enthusiasm was good, the group only really began to grow when the group as a whole became accountable and responsible for itself, and that meant sharing the financial burden of administrating it too. </p>
        <p class="style13 style29">Time and time again, we hear at CTI from course participants how refreshing it is to find themselves amongst such a diverse group of like-minded people, and, moreover, have a model in Co-active Coaching through which they can form authentic and lasting relationships with each other. It's what Co-activity is all about -- being together in a new, more open way. It's our hope that the Local Groups initiative will continue to keep this spirit alive. </p>
        <p class="style13 style29">We will be e-mailing a local groups update to you during July. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.coaching-courses.com/resource_centre_and_downloads/cti_uk_local_groups_listing.phtml">click here</a> for a full listing of coordinators and contact details. </p>
