	  <p>Greetings,</p>
	  <p>On October 19 in Glendale, CA, and November 6 in San Rafael, CA, The Coaches Training Institute will be holding our 3-day Fundamentals course, and there are still a few seats available. If you are still considering coach training, now is a great time to take action! </p>
	  <p><strong>About Fundamentals</strong><br>
	    CTI&rsquo;s Fundamentals program provides training and practical experience in the techniques and skills of the coaching profession, specifically Co-Active Coaching. This course is oriented toward participation and practical experience rather than lecture. You will have extensive opportunities to coach and to receive feedback on your coaching. </p>
	  <p><strong>As a result of taking this course, you will learn to:</strong> </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use the four cornerstones of Co-Active Coaching with your clients. </li>
	    <li>Communicate with your clients using the five contexts of Co-Active Coaching. </li>
	    <li>Use the Life (Balance) Wheel with clients. </li>
	    <li>Distinguish and use the three levels of listening. </li>
	    <li>Demonstrate the most-often-used coaching skills. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p><strong>Special Offer for California Programs</strong><br>
	    We understand that Fall can be a very busy time. To encourage you to take a second look at your calendar, we&rsquo;d like to offer you an incentive: <strong><em>$200 off the regular tuition of $695. </em></strong>This offer is only valid for this course.</p>
	  <p>To reserve your place in the California Fundamentals programs, <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/coaching/registration-full-package.html" target="_blank" class="orange">simply click here</a>, enter your contact information, and a CTI registar will contact you to verify your discounted price of $495 prior to charging your credit card.</p>
	  <p>We look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
