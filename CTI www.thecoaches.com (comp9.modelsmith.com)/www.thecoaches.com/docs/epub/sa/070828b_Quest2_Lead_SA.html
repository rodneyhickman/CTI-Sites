	  <p>Dearest Leadership Friends,</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Do you find it hard to explain      leadership to your friends and family?</li>
	    <li>Do you have friends and family      who are interested in CTI courses but not interested in becoming coaches?</li>
	    <li>Do you know someone in      transition who is looking for what's next in his or her journey?</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>If you answered yes to even one of these questions, we have a wonderful, new program that we'd like to share with you, your family and friends! It is called: Quest--A Leader&rsquo;s Journey. Finally! A CTI program that is open to everyone, not just people wanting to become certified coaches. </p>
	  <p>Designed to &quot;build muscle around clarity,&quot; this powerful program lets participants tap into their inner leader, identify their true purpose and then move forward with confidence and grace by answering these three questions: </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Who am I?</strong> <em>&quot;An exploration of your authentic self&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>Where am I going?</strong> <em>&quot;The compelling path that pulls you forward&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>How do I get there?</strong> <em>&quot;Bringing your sense of purpose to the world&quot;</em> </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Quest will help participants discover their authentic selves, understand where they are going and teach them the necessary skills they'll need to make their purpose real in the world. <br>
  We are excited about this new program and can&rsquo;t wait to share it with you, your family and friends. </p>
	  <p><strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong> will be held September 14-16 in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/SFOFHHH-Hilton-San-Francisco-California/index.do" target="_blank" class="orange">Hilton San Francisco</a>. The fee for this pilot program is $595.</p>
	  <p>For more information, please contact registration at 1-800-691-6008 or visit our website at&nbsp; <br>

	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>With much excitement, </p>
	  <p>Your friends at CTI    </p>
