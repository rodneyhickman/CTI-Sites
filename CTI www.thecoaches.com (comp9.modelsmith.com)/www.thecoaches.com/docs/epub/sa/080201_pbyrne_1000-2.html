	  <p>Hello all:</p>
	  <p>Let me start by saying thank you! The response to my email last week announcing the <strong>1,000 Lives in 100 Days</strong> challenge has been fantastic, and already more than 50 people have registered to attend Co-Active Fundamentals. For anyone who missed my previous email, you can read it <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dktcznj_4f5cwnvdr" target="_blank" class="orange">HERE</a> and on <a href="http://www.1000in100.com/" target="_blank" class="orange">MY BLOG</a>.</p>
	  <p>I've received tons of great feedback and some really creative ideas. I've also heard loud and clear the desire to find a mutually beneficial approach that can introduce folks to the Co-Active Fundamentals program, while at the same time HELPING YOU GROW YOUR COACHING PRACTICE! I am totally aligned with this strategy and want to tell you about something we've created to support that goal.</p>
	  <p>One of the programs most frequently requested by CTI graduates is a simple, effective way to introduce prospective coaching clients to the incredible value of coaching. We all know that if someone has tried coaching, they are hooked; the challenge is often helping them initially understand WHAT coaching is and HOW it can be of benefit. This can be a particular challenge when approaching small business or &quot;corporate&quot; clients who frequently require a bit more background and data (all that left-brain stuff) before taking the leap.</p>
	  <p>To help you bridge the gap with prospective clients, CTI is launching a free webinar designed exclusively for you to market to your prospective clients, titled: &quot;<strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/coaching/3skillsweb.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Three Critical Coaching Skills for Managers</a></strong>.&quot; (We will introduce similar programs for life/career coaching soon.) The idea is to create a high-value seminar where you can send your prospective coaching clients to learn more about what coaching can do for them. The compelling 60-minute webinar  will:</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Walk participants through the research quantifying      coaching's business impact.</li>
	    <li>Introduce      them to the three critical coaching skills every manager must master.</li>
	    <li>Highlight how being coached can impact both individual and team performance.</li>
	    <li>Allow them to listen to a live coaching demonstration      and ask questions. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The webinars will be hosted by CTI's most experienced corporate workshop leaders, and participants will leave with a firm understanding of what Co-Active Coaching is all about and how it can support their success in life and work.</p>
	  <p>What we know for sure is that introducing more managers and leaders to the unique value of coaching will create opportunities for everyone. For CTI, we suspect some participants will want to gain a deeper understanding of coaching and may eventually attend Co-Active Fundamentals. For you, we will leave participants completely bought-in to the value of coaching and ready to take the next step with <u>you</u> as their coach. During the webinar, we will emphasize that the <u>absolute best way</u> to experience coaching is to hire a qualified Co-Active Coach. Every participant will see first-hand the benefits of being coached.</p>
	  <p><strong>What's Next?</strong><br>
	    First, I want to encourage you to visit and subscribe to <a href="http://www.1000in100.com/" target="_blank" class="orange">MY BLOG</a>, if you have not already. This is the place where we will provide more detail, dates and ongoing information regarding this and future programs to support your business. I've also created a simple <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dktcznj_11gsmvgcfp&hl=en" target="_blank" class="orange">email template</a> you can use to invite your prospective and current  clients to the webinar. There is no cost to participants, and admission is by invitation only. (You can view more information on the event <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/coaching/3skillsweb.html" target="_blank" class="orange">HERE</a>.) Be sure to tell your contacts to <u>enter your name</u> as the person who referred them to CTI, when registering to attend the webinar, so we can report back which of your contacts attended and are ready to hire a coach!</p>
	  <p>Thank you again for your continued support...and I'll see you on the <a href="http://www.1000in100.com/" target="_blank" class="orange">Blog</a>.</p>
