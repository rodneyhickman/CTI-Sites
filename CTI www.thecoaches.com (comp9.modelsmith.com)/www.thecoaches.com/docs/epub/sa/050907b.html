	  <p> Dear

      Co-Active Network Members</p>
	  <p> Earlier
	    this month we reached the milestone
	    of 5,000 members on the Co-Active
	    Network.&nbsp;When
	    the Coaches Training Institute
	    started the Co-Active Network
	    in mid-2004, we dreamed that
	    it would become a thriving,
	    vibrant community supporting
	    the continuous learning and
	    success of each of its members.&nbsp;Each
	    day as I read the variety and
	    depth of discussions, participate
	    in the calendared events of
	    various communities, and meet
	    with the dedicated organizers
	    who volunteer their time and
	    passion, I am awed by how this
      dream has become a reality.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p> To
	    celebrate this milestone and
	    thank you for your participation
	    in making it possible, we are
	    offering you an opportunity
	    to share the magic of Co-Activity.&nbsp;Effective
	    immediately, we are offering
	    two $250 discounts off of the
	    Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals
	    course to each member of the
	    Co-Active Network.&nbsp;If
	    you have already taken the
	    Fundamentals course, you can
	    share these discounts with
	    a friend, a client or a family
	    member.&nbsp; </p>

	    are the details of this offer:</p>
