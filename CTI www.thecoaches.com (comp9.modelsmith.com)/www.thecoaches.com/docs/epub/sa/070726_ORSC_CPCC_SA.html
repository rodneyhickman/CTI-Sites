              Fundamentals is an introduction to Relationship Systems Coaching 
              and is an advanced level course designed to introduce you to a coaching 
              specialization that will provide you with new marketable skills 
              for your practice. Become a Relationship Systems Coach with competency 
              in coaching business partners, teams, groups, boards, families and/or 
              couples. The unique contribution of the ORSC model is that it provides 
              coaches, consultants, therapists, facilitators and more, with a 
              way to work directly with the <strong><em>system</em></strong> rather 
              than do <em><strong>individual</strong></em> work within the system. 
              If you want to increase your skills in listening for &#8220;the

                  course graduates are saying about the Relationship Systems Coaching 
                  curriculum:<em><br>
                  <br>
                  &#8220;We were called in to a very tough situation about two 
                  weeks ago, an emergency, with a request for a quick intervention. 
                  It involved a challenging employee survey within a large organization. 
                  We structured a day to reveal the data, and the system. We created 
                  a number of exercises that led 24 individuals to what we called,&#8221; 
                  the Voice of the Team&#8221; exercise. We spent about one and 
                  a half hours exploring the voices in the system. I don&#8217;t 
                  know if I have experienced anything quite like this. The way 
                  the system called us to push, and cajole, and be a surrogate 
                  for what needed to be said. It was magic (your magic). It made 
                  an impact. We have been in a bit of a whirlwind ever since, 
                  and it looks like that as of today, we will be hired to do several 
                  more of these sessions and to develop a full implementation 
                  strategy.&#8221; -<strong> Deb Silverson, CPCC, Colorado</strong></em><br>
