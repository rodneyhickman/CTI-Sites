	Relationship Intelligence: Process and Flow</b>    
	<p style="margin: 15 0 0 0"><b>Vancouver, BC, metro area<br>
	  Course dates: March 23-25, 2007</b>
	  <p>Relationship Intelligence: Process and Flow is the second course in CTI's Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching Program. It provides a learning space where you can deepen and hone the skills of Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching. This three-day advanced course is open only to those who have completed the Fundamentals course in the series.</p>
	  <p><strong>Relationship Intelligence: Process and Flow</strong> addresses deep processes of emotional experience. Emotions are the currency of relationship. The coach that cannot wade into the deep water, ride the emotional rapids or appreciate the shallow &quot;edges,&quot; will not be able to sustain relationship systems work. </p>
	  <p>In this course, you will be introduced to Arnold Mindell's Process Work and a new skill set for the unfolding and following of emotional processes through working with &quot;signals, channels and edges.&quot; Practicing these skills, you'll discover the power of Deep Democracy with and for your clients. Deep Democracy insists that all the voices of a system be heard&mdash;even the unpopular ones! Only then the fullness of that system's reality will be available for change. By mastering these skills, you will be able to fluidly move with whatever shows up in the system and in the coaching. </p>
	  <p>It is this dimension of systems coaching that initiates coaches into the reality of relationship coaching as important and transformational work in the world. </p>
	  <p>In the <strong>Relationship Intelligence</strong> course, you will:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Have an entirely new model for coaching individuals, couples and organizational relationships based in Arnold Mindell's Process Work. </li>
	    <li>Be able to coach and integrate information from multiple sources (body based, visual, auditory and world channels). </li>
	    <li>Facilitate clients in expanding their range of emotional awareness and expression by recognizing emerging secondary processes. </li>
	    <li>Know six new ways to identify and unfold emerging emotional processes in order to expand the emotional range of relationship. </li>
	    <li>Be able to apply coaching techniques for deepening and managing emotionally intense issues in both intimate and organizational relationships. </li>
	    <li>Know how to identify and diminish highly negative conflict styles (the four horsemen of the apocalypse). </li>
	    <li>Know how to increase positivity within business and personal relationships through application of appreciation loops and dream doors. </li>
	    <li>Feel more confident in working with emotionally charged material within all types of relationships. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The cost of the Relationship Intelligence course is <strong>$895</strong>.</p>
	  <p><strong>PREREQUISITES:</strong></p>
