      <p>It took courage for LOHAS business pioneers to build their companies upon values not yet embraced by a large consumer base. The Coaches Training Institute honors your leadership stance as you have helped craft the business rules of TODAY by melding sustainability with profitability—you made your living and working values work!</p>
      <p>Gone are the days of short-term business profits and back are the important values we all share: authenticity, sustainability, integrity, generosity and a dedication to quality. For many of us, a large dose of hope has been restored as our world awakens to buying everyday products with a tie to their company's values.</p>
