	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">The Co-Active Network and The Coaches Training Institute will be at the ICF conference in St. Louis, MO, from November 1–4 this year. As a member of the Co-Active Network, we’d like to invite you to join us as a Network ambassador.  
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Here’s what’s involved:
	  <ul style="margin: 10 0 0 30">
                    <li>Talk about your experience in the Co-Active Network to folks you know and meet during the conference.  
                    <li>Let them know what it’s opened up for you in your practice and what you see as the benefits of being a member. 
                    <li>Invite them to find out more about the network at the CTI booth (211) and at the Co-Active Network party on Friday, November 3.                                        
	  </ul>	
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/sa/images/why.jpg" width="510" height="20">    
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">Being an ambassador is a great way to make new connections, and increase your visibility and leadership within your Network niche at the same time. You’ll deepen your experience in the community, and get to know other ambassadors and the CTI team. Besides that, it’s fun!  
	  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">As a thank you, we’ll be acknowledging you at the party on Friday night and giving you a surprise gift at the conference!
	<p style="margin: 20 0 0 0"><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/sa/images/whatsnext.jpg" width="510" height="20">    
	<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you are interested in this opportunity, you can guarantee your spot with an RSVP by October 10 to <a href="mailto:CoActiveAmbassador@thecoaches.com" class="orange">CoActiveAmbassador@thecoaches.com</a>. When you get to the conference, all you need to do is pick up an orientation packet from the CTI booth (211).
      <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">If you’re not interested, we hope you’ll stop by our booth to say hello and also come to our Friday night party, “A Trip Around the World With the Co-Active Network.” Tickets are available at the booth. We look forward to seeing you there!
