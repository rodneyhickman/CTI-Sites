	  <p>Dear Fellow CPCCs, <br>
        <br>
I hope you are enjoying the late days of summer! At CTI, the warm weather has brought a burst of creativity and a new initiative that I am incredibly excited about. We have designed a completely new program with the working title <strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong>.&nbsp;Finally, something from CTI that you can share with your family and friends!</p>
	  <p>As the name may suggest, this course is closely aligned with the Co-Active Leadership Model and is one of the most ambitious designs we've ever attempted. I have no doubt this program will change lives and be at the center of who CTI is becoming--and I <strong><em>know</em></strong> we need <strong>your</strong> help to make this program a success.<br>
          <br>
	    Over the course of three days, the participants of Quest will embark on a journey into their own personal leadership. They will become deeply intimate with the essence of themselves, the center of what is most important to them, and discover ways to begin bringing their authenticity and purpose more fully into the world. The program contains all new content and a brand new format, as we will be working with a large group but in a way that still holds the intimacy and power of a CTI experience. </p>
	  <p>As you may know, we held a Quest pilot in July for CPCCs only. The feedback from all who participated was invaluable and has resulted in a program I could not be more proud of. But there is still a little work to be done--and here is where I still need your help. I want to invite you to play with us on September 14-16 and be part of the final design process by: </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Being      a full-out participant in the program.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inviting      a client to participate in the program with you. Any client you invite      will receive a $100.00 discount off the regular tuition of $595--and so do      you! When you or your client are registering for Quest, simply enter the      coupon code listed below in the field provided and your discount will be      applied.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Coupon      Code: 091407</strong></li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Our second Quest pilot will be held on September 14-16 in San Francisco at the <a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/SFOFHHH-Hilton-San-Francisco-California/index.do" target="_blank" class="orange">Hilton San Francisco</a><a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/SFOFHHH-Hilton-San-Francisco-California/index.do"></a>. The fee for this pilot program is $595.</p>
	  <p>Rather than flood you with details in this email, I invite you to attend a call I'm hosting. On the call, I will provide more details about the program, the built-in business opportunity for all CPCCs and address any questions you may have.

	  <p>Please come and play with me!</p>
	  <p>Much love,</p>
