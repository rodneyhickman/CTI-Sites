	  <p>Hello Wonderful CPCCs,</p>
	  <p>Two weeks ago, I sent you an email regarding our exciting, new program, <strong>Quest--A Leader's Journey</strong>. Since then, we have been overwhelmed with inquiries from our valued CPCCs wanting to know more, more, more! </p>
	  <p>We are truly delighted with your questions and curiosity, so, instead of flooding you with details in an email, I'd like to invite you to attend a &quot;Quest Call&quot; with Karen Kimsey-House. On the call, Karen will provide more details about Quest, address any questions you may have and talk to you about the built-in business opportunity designed just for our valued CPCCs.</p>
	  <p><strong>Call Date and Time</strong><br>
	    The call will be held on <strong>Wednesday, October 24, from 3-4 p.m. Pacific</strong>. To register for the call, please click here: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/Quest/contact-form-8377.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Quest Call</a>.</p>
	  <p>You can also find out more about Quest (or sign-up directly) by visiting our website at: <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/quest" target="_blank" class="orange">http://www.thecoaches.com/quest</a>.<u></u></p>
	  <p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Quest Logistics</strong> <br>
        Quest will be held November 30-December 2, 2007, in Washington, D.C. The fee for this program is $750.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Unique Business Opportunity      for CPCCs Only!<br>
        </strong>Quest holds a unique business opportunity in the CTI world for our CPCCs. Karen will go into more details about this opportunity on the call.</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Bring a Friend to Quest and      Save!<br>
        </strong>Quest is FINALLY a program from CTI that you can share with your family and friends. If you invite a friend or family member to participate in Quest with you, anyone you invite will receive a $150 discount off the regular tuition of $750--and so will you! (That&rsquo;s $150 off for both of you.)</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. </p>
	  <p>Hope to hear you on the call!</p>
