	  <p align="left" style="margin: 25 10 0 10">Hello
	    Fellow Co-Active Coaches,
	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">I
	      would like to invite each
	      of you to attend this year&rsquo;s
	      ICF International Conference
	      in San Jose, California!
	      If you haven&rsquo;t
	      been to an ICF conference,
	      or haven&rsquo;t
	      been for a while, this is
	      the one to attend. (And take
	      note that the discounted
	      early-bird registration rate
	      is still available through
	      to August 31.) It will be
	      an event to remember as hundreds
	      of coaches from around the
	      world have spent months developing
	      this conference to make it
	      an extra-special event&mdash;being
	      our 10th anniversary&mdash;and
	      ensure its value to individual
	      coaches and the coaching
	      community.
	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">The
	      ICF Conference provides an
	      amazing opportunity for coaches
	      to meet face-to-face and
	      talk with many other new
	      and experienced coaches from
	      around the world. With so
	      much time spent connecting
	      via phone or e-mail, I think
	      you will find a special energy
	      and value in the opportunity
	      to connect in person. (I
	      love the learning, connections,
	      inspiration and plain old
	      fun of these events. There
	      is something very special
	      that happens when you get
	      more than 1,000 coaches together.
	      I always come away inspired
	      with some great new ideas
	      to grow my business.) 
	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">In
	      San Jose, there will be presentations
	      that speak to exactly where
	      you are in your coaching
	      business. There will be many
	      opportunities to grow as
	      coaches. Presenters will
	      address the issues and concerns
	      faced by new coaches to assist
	      them in developing skills
	      to build profitable and productive
	      businesses. Other presenters
	      will challenge long-time,
	      established coaches with
	      mind-expanding concepts to
	      assist them in taking their
	      businesses to the next level.
	      There are more than 40 seminars
	      in all, and each year we
	      try to maximize the number
	      of experiential learning
	      opportunities.  
	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10"> And
	      we will be celebrating! This
	      10th Anniversary event is
	      a one-time opportunity to
	      come together with friends
	      and colleagues to celebrate
	      the end of the decade that
	      launched the coaching profession
	      and saw it reach new levels
	      of professionalism. We would
	      love for you to be part of
	      this. 
	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">To
	      register for the conference

	    <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">I
	      look forward to seeing you
	      in San Jose.
      <p align="left" style="margin: 10 10 0 10">Yours
