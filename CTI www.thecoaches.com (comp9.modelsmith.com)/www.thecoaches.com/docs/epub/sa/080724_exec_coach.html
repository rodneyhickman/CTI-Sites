       <h2><strong>Internal Co-Active Coaching (ICC)</strong></h2>
       <p>Over the past decade, executive coaching has become standard practice for large organizations. Gone are the days when product, distribution or cost make or break a business. The standard that sets top-performing businesses apart nowadays includes being able to quickly turn strategies into action. Coaching has proven to be a powerful tool to do just that, and delivering coaching to senior executives has become an increasingly accepted leadership-development tool. </p>
      <p>For 15 years, the Coaches Training Institute has blazed the way in applying coaching within organizations. CTI is the largest company in its field, and its coaching curriculum was the first to be internationally accredited by the International Coaching Federation. Over the last decade, CTI has trained leaders from nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies and has certified the largest number of professional coaches worldwide.</p>
      <p>Learned coaching skills are helping decision-makers create higher levels of organizational effectiveness through dialogue, inquiry and positive interactions, which, in turn, maximize learning, quality and teamwork. While there are benefits to the external coach approach, a growing number of organizations are training teams of internal coaches in order to bring more efficiency, accountability and cost-effectiveness to executive coaching. Embedding coaching into existing learning and development processes makes it accessible to more people and creates a greater impact. Internal coaching can feed the leadership pipeline, drive change and leadership development, and provide better ROI than many other commonly used learning tools.</p>
