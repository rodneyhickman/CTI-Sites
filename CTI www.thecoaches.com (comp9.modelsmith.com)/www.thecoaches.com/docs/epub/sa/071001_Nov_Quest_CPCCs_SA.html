	  <p>Hello CPCCs! </p>
	  <p>This summer, CTI launched a new program: Quest--A Leader's Journey. After two very successful West Coast programs, we've decided to take Quest on the road. We're headed for the East Coast and we'd LOVE to see you there. </p>
	  <p><strong>About Quest</strong><br>
	    We are SO excited about this new program. Quest is like nothing CTI has ever done before, and the positive response from participants (130 so far!) has been thrilling!</p>
	  <p>Over the course of three days, Quest participants will embark on a journey into their own personal leadership. Designed to &quot;build muscle around clarity,&quot; the program helps participants access the leader within themselves, identify their true purpose and move forward with confidence and grace by answering the questions: </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Who am I?</strong> <em>&quot;An exploration of your authentic self&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>Where am I going?</strong> <em>&quot;The compelling path that pulls you forward&quot;</em> </li>
	    <li><strong>How do I get there?</strong> <em>&quot;Bringing your sense of purpose to the world&quot;</em> </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Participants will become deeply intimate with the essence of themselves, the center of what is most important to them, and discover ways to begin bringing their authenticity and purpose more fully into the world.&nbsp;Quest contains all new content and a brand new format. In this program, we will be working with a large group while still holding the intimacy and power of a CTI experience. &nbsp;</p>
	  <p><strong>Date, Location and Tuition</strong><br>
	    Quest will be held November 30-December 2 in the Washington D.C. metro area. The fee for this program is $750.</p>
	  <p><strong>Unique Business Opportunity for CPCCs Only!</strong><br>
	    Quest holds a unique business opportunity in the CTI world for our fantastic CPCCs<strong> (and only CPCCs)</strong>. We will be using the November Quest program as a starting point in training CPCCs to become &quot;Quest Coaches.&quot;</p>
	  <p>This is a great opportunity for CPCCs to get involved with CTI in a whole new way and will allow you to lead an intimate group of Questers on their new journeys. In order to be considered for this position, you must attend a Quest program.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <p><strong>Bring a Friend to Quest and Save!</strong><br>
	    Quest (FINALLY) is a program from CTI that you can share with your clients, family and friends. If you invite a client, friend or family member to participate in Quest with you, anyone you invite will receive a $150 discount off the regular tuition of $750&hellip;and so will you! <strong><em>(That's a $150 discount for each of you.) </em></strong></p>
	  <p>There is no limit to the number of guests you can bring. When you or your guest register for Quest, simply enter the coupon code listed below in the field provided on the registration page and your discount will be applied at the time of confirmation. <strong>Coupon Code: 113007</strong> </p>
