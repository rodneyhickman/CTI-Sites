	<p style="margin-top:7; margin-bottom:0">June 23, 2004
	<p style="margin-top:27; margin-bottom:0">Dear CTI Graduates and Colleagues:
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">It is with great enthusiasm and anticipation that I invite you to be both our honored guests and our pioneering leaders in launching the brand new Co-Active Network. The purpose of this network is to support every member in achieving his/her greatest vision for co-active coaching and leadership in the world.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><b>Why the Co-Active Network</b><br>As a brand new dad of a wondrous little girl (my princess Teesa), I am powerfully reminded of why I am in the co-active game. My own passion ultimately is for our children. I want to leave a world behind where children are empowered to preserve their natural beauty, dignity, creativity and abundant possibility into their adulthood, breaking the cycle of pain and diminishment that keeps getting repeated. I believe the key to this transformation is to teach our children co-active life skills so they are well prepared for life's inevitable challenges. I also believe we need a minimal critical mass of adults in the world to acquire the co-active life skills themselves before we can really create a different world for our children. My "hundredth monkey" number for this critical mass is 50 million people by 2023.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">CTI could not directly train or coach 50 million people by 2023. We need a vibrant community of thousands of coaches and leaders such as you, supporting, educating, guiding and challenging each other in manifesting each member's greatest vision for co-active impact in the world. We need each of our coaches to be magnificently successful and have full practices. We need each of our leaders to be in powerful action, inspiring others and generating results. If each individual in this community achieves his/her own greatest vision, we will far surpass 50 million co-active CEOs, managers, parents, educators, artists, healers, politicians and world leaders by 2023.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><b>How It Works</b><br>The Co-Active Network is an online community organized into a Main Community and then myriad specific Niche communities and Geographic communities. Once you join, you will automatically belong to the Main Community and can then choose to join as many Niche and Geographic communities as you wish. There are currently 13 Niche communities, and we are hoping to grow to 100. They range from Coaching in Organizations, to Relationship Coaching, to Spirituality and Coaching.
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0">Each community offers discussion boards, a calendar of events and a list of important resources, among other things. It will also offer a way for you to automatically sign up for free community-specific events, many of which are telecalls featuring guest speakers.  Membership in the network is free, without any obligations whatsoever. Go to <a href="http://www.coactivenetwork.com">www.coactivenetwork.com</a> to register. It will take less than one minute.
	<p style="margin-top:16; margin-bottom:0">I hope to see and interact with you on the network!
	<p style="margin-top:27; margin-bottom:0">With anticipation and gratitude,
	<p style="margin-top:10; margin-bottom:0"><b>Shirzad Chamine</b><br>President and CEO<br>The Coaches Training Institute
