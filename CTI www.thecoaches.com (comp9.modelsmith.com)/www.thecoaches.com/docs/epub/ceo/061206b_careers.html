	  <p>Dear Co-Active Colleagues:</p>
      <p>I am delighted to let you know that your enthusiastic spreading of the word about our work has resulted in unprecedented demand for what we do in both the public and, increasingly, the corporate arena. We are so grateful that our community continues to be self-generative. </p>
      <p>To support this growth, CTI is looking to fill a variety of positions. When we  recently looked to hire a VP of Marketing and VP of Corporate Development, we were delighted by the quality of our own graduates who applied for, and eventually filled, both positions. We are coming to you once again for several positions. Please feel free to forward this information to anyone you know who might be a good fit.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, CTI has helped transform individual and organizational lives, and the people we have touched have, in return, helped CTI evolve and transform through its own key junctures of growth. This is another of those key junctures, and we would very much appreciate your contribution to making it happen.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Please click on the position of interest below for more information. The deadline for applications is December 19, 2006. </p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/careers/CFO.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Chief Financial Officer</a></strong></p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/careers/Admissions_Advisor.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Admissions Advisor</a></strong></p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/careers/Client_Service_Representative.html" target="_blank" class="orange">Client Service Representative</a></strong></p>
      <p>You can also visit <strong><a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/careers" target="_blank" class="orange">Careers at CTI</a></strong>,  where new positions will be posted on an ongoing basis.</p>
      <p>With gratitude,</p>
      <p><strong><em>Shirzad</em></strong></p>
      <p>Shirzad Chamine, CEO<br>
        The Coaches Training Institute</p></td>
