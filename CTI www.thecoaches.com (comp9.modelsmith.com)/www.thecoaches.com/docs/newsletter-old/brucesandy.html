<h1>The Riches of Rituals in Coaching and in Life </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rituals are acts, celebrations, ceremonies or practices that help demarcate special and everyday events in a person&rsquo;s life. They are also practices that help people become more conscious or present and stay centered and grounded on a regular basis. Ritual is defined in the Webster&rsquo;s dictionary as: 1. The established form, especially for a religious ceremony. 2. A system of rites. 3. A ceremonial act or action. and 4. A customarily repeated act or series of acts. Rituals are an important part of recognizing people&rsquo;s journey in life. They allow one to pause, reflect and celebrate the important passages in one&rsquo;s life. Rituals often allow people to tell their stories about their quests and the challenges they have overcome to reach their current state and position in life. The telling of stories and the performance of rituals is the glue that has built and held families, communities and societies together in the past. In our fast-paced society today, many of the rituals that were used in the past have fallen by the wayside. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Coaching offers an important venue to allow clients to tell their stories and introduce or re-introduce rituals back into their lives. Rituals form an important part of my work with clients including individuals, couples/partners, teams and organizations. A variety of rituals and practices also help me be the best possible coach for my clients. Rituals offer a multitude of benefits for both clients and coaches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Coaching can be viewed as a ritual itself in that it is a confidential and sacred time in which clients connect with their coach on a regular basis to tell their stories, learn and practice ways to stay focused, celebrate both wins and losses, reflect on what they have learned on their journey and make commitments to themselves and others. I introduce the concept of ritual right away to my clients. It forms an important part of designing the alliance. I often use the analogy that coaching is a sacred and safe container where clients can come on a regular basis. The alliance is the container that the client and coach design together and recreate each time they meet. This is a ritual in and of itself. The alliance or container is the safe and confidential place where the client can share his/her stories, fears, celebrations, defeats, wins, practices and learnings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the start of each coaching session, I ask clients if they would like to empty out the container by sitting in silence. They also have the choice of clearing off any of the fears or activities or &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that they have been carrying with them over the last week to 10 days by sharing the items that are occupying their mind. I then ask them what their intentions are for the session and what they would like to focus on or what they would like to pour into the coaching container. This is a ritual that I perform with all clients at the start of each coaching session. The benefit of this is that it allows the clients (and me) to be more present, conscious and focused during the coaching session.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During each session, I encourage clients to tell their stories and to celebrate their wins and life events, such as landing a great job or client, completing a major project, buying a new house, and/or celebrating a birthday, anniversary or any other major or minor milestone in their lives, careers and relationships. I also invite my clients to celebrate the learnings, awakenings and increased consciousness from their mistakes, challenges and failures. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I invite my clients to find rituals and practices each day that allow them to stay grounded and centered. These rituals and practices may involve anything from meditation to spending time in nature to journaling to dancing to prayer to spending time with their pets to simply looking into their partner&rsquo;s or loved one&rsquo;s eyes. I encourage more active clients to pick a sport, exercise or activity that they love and to build it into their schedule as part of their regular habit or ritual. I encourage couples and partners to establish regular dates and intimate times together. I invite them to look upon this as sacred time. I often ask them to design a ritual or ceremony such as washing each other&rsquo;s feet, giving each other massages or feeding one another as a way of appreciating and celebrating their love. Some of the many benefits of introducing rituals and celebrations into the clients&rsquo; lives are that it allows them to have more fully conscious, authentic and connected lives. As a result, the clients are happier, healthier, more connected to their emotions, more in tune with their bodies, more creative and more productive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of my own self care and to be truly present with my clients, I perform a number of rituals and practices each day. My daily rituals and practices involve meditation, prayer, journaling, setting intentions, being out in nature, reflection, expressions of gratitude, mindful eating and regular exercise. Prior to each coaching session, I spend two to five minutes in silence and meditation. I clear the space and I set the intentions for being open, conscious and fully present with my clients. At the end of each day, I will take some time to reflect on my interactions with clients, journal and express my gratitude for my work with and learnings from clients and often say a prayer for clients and for those most in need in the world. One day each weekend, I perform a media fast&mdash;a ritual which involves no exposure to media of any kind. Often I will spend all or part of this day in silence. These rituals and practices allow me to come back to my core and get in touch with my heart and soul. They allow me to stay in touch with the Universe. These rituals allow me to be more mindful and fully conscious and present for my clients and in my own life. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am conscious of celebrating the everyday gifts of life such as the beauty of nature, food, shelter, a loving partner, good friends and family. One of my rituals each day is to journal five things that I am blessed with or grateful about. Reflection and remembrance is another important ritual for my life. I also do this with my clients by scheduling regular reflection sessions with them so that they have a chance to remember and celebrate the progress in their lives, careers, businesses and relationships. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rituals bring a great richness to one&rsquo;s life and the lives of others. I invite you to become more conscious of the rituals in your life and your coaching practice. Reflect on what they do for you and what they have done or can do for your clients. Look for opportunities to introduce more rituals and celebration into your coaching and in your own life. You will be glad you did.&nbsp; </p>
