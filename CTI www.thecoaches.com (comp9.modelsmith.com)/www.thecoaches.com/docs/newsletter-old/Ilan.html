<p align="left" class="style4" style="margin-top:0;">Diversity in Coaching&mdash;Everyone Benefits</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This article addresses three areas relating to coaching and diversity: </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">1. The integral link between coaching and valuing diversity </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">2. The importance of cultural diversity among coaches </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;">3. The need to extend coaching services to a wide cross-section of society. </p>
<p class="style3">Coaching and valuing diversity are intimately intertwined. One feeds the other. From my perspective as a cross-cultural coach, the synergy between coaching and valuing diversity is like two musicians making harmony. Each musician has a distinct role and creates beautiful music with the other by finding the magic blend of their differences. This is equitable to a coach who has an impact in his/her client&rsquo;s life by valuing the client&rsquo;s uniqueness. </p>
<p class="style3">When coaches hold clients as naturally creative, resourceful and whole, they are paying tribute to valuing diversity. When coaches listen to clients&rsquo; dreams, when coaches discover the values of their clients, when coaches honor the belief systems of clients without judgment, they demonstrate a commitment to finding the diamond in each client. The &ldquo;client&rdquo; can be an individual, a team, a company, a community or a nation. In today&rsquo;s age of globalization, it is critically important to view coworkers, neighbors, customers and clients from a place of valuing differences. Co-Active coaching is built on this premise, an equal relationship between coach and client. Therefore, Co-Active coaching offers powerful tools to make a significant contribution in the public, private and NGO sectors.</p>
<p class="style3">Just imagine a world where we embrace and celebrate differences rather than get embarrassed by them. The more effectively a coach taps into a client&rsquo;s uniqueness, whether the client is an individual or a work team or a company, the greater the potential for the client to connect with his/her authenticity. </p>
<p class="style3">Let&rsquo;s bring this down to a very practical level. Americans generally value following the rules and being honest. Israelis generally value creativity. This is why when you enter a parking lot in the United States, you see cars parked between the lines. In a parking lot in Israel, cars relate to the lines as a &ldquo;suggestion.&rdquo; Do you view someone as wrong in this situation, or just different? </p>
<p class="style3"><em>Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus</em>, a long-standing best-selling book, simply states that the two genders have different ways of viewing the world, not good or bad, just different. This is the mindset we are constantly attempting to reach as coaches.</p>
<p class="style3">As a young and rapidly growing profession, I contend that it is critically important for there to be wide diversity among people practicing the profession. Each coach brings her/his own flavor, experiences and expertise as a coach. Like any profession, there is added value by having people of many different backgrounds. Diversity among coaches will enhance the caliber of coaching. It will enrich the professional development of everyone. The coaching profession, if represented by people from many cultures, socio-economic backgrounds, educational backgrounds, religions and races, will demonstrate the value of pluralism, a pillar of the profession. Some contend currently that the people attracted to coaching as a career represent a middle-class majority. Therefore, I contend it would be wise to develop significant efforts to increase diversity among professionals in the coaching community.</p>
<p class="style3">This includes finding creative ways to recruit minorities of all types&mdash;people with differences in terms of their race, socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientation, religious and geographic origins. </p>
<p class="style3">As a young, developing profession, it is important to look at who turns to coaching as a tool to move their lives forward. This concept itself may appear elitist. &ldquo;Who has time and money to think about dreams?&rdquo; some people may ask. Most of the world is not as preoccupied as North Americans with finding fulfillment. However, wherever one finds themselves on Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, coaching can be a powerful tool to help people get &ldquo;unstuck&rdquo; and move forward. Therefore, how coaching is marketed among different socio-economic groups and among different cultures will reflect the profession&rsquo;s commitment to pluralism and valuing diversity. </p>
<p class="style3">Coaching is a powerful tool to use with any population, which further emphasizes why all types of people need to be actively welcomed into the profession. Coaching is a tool that can benefit almost anyone. Therefore, it is important to attract culturally diverse people into the community of coaches, which will likely draw culturally diverse clients as well. This will require offering affordable services in a creative way for everyone and the need to creatively extend coaching services to a wider cross-section of society. This is a global vision. It is important to meet cultural norms in different places of the world and among diverse population groups. Everyone benefits.</p>
