<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>CTI Staff Profile -- Trudy Kendall </strong></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Trudy Kendall, CPCC, PCC, was born in Richland, WA, on April 7, 1949. She is a unique and irreplaceable voice in the office at CTI. She seems soft and cuddly, but look out! Trudy will tell it like it is with no holds barred, and this is actually a very good thing, as her impact is for the benefit of all. There is only one Trudy Kendall in this world! Rather than speak for her (I would not recommend trying to do this), I thought it would be best if we heard from Miss Trudy in her own words&hellip;</p>
<p><em>My first job was working for Avon as an &ldquo;Avon Lady.&rdquo; I was actually an &ldquo;Avon Girl&rdquo; because I was only about 16 at the time. My favorite part of that job was all the little bottles, potions and lotions and the little bag I got to carry around the neighborhood with me. I was terrible at selling! It was one of those things&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Olivia&rsquo;s daughter at the door. I&rsquo;ll buy a little something!&rdquo; I also had this totally cool Chanel-style suit my older sister had made. I felt so sophisticated and grown-up. I probably made all of 10 bucks!</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been at CTI since 1999 and have had a variety of positions. I actually started as a volunteer&mdash;I live close by the office in San Rafael, I was coaching from home and wanting more in-person contact with people. CTI liked me, and I liked them, so after two days as a volunteer, I was hired&mdash;initially to assist with managing the certification program. A few positions and years later, I am now the Director of Strategic Initiatives. My job is to work on new programs that are not yet a part of CTI&rsquo;s established curriculum. I work with the course designers, marketing, finance, logistics, etc., to get new programs into the pilot phase and then into full production when other parts of the organization take over.</em></p>
<p><em>What I really love about my job is the variety. There is nothing routine about my work&mdash;everyday I am presented with new challenges and situations. My work utilizes many of my strengths and skills&mdash;I&rsquo;m pretty good at creating relationships that work (except when I&rsquo;m not), as well as working with and/or creating systems, both of which are essential components of my work.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to being on staff at CTI, I am a supervisor and an examiner in the certification program. I also have my own coaching business, coaching mothers with teenage daughters. Again, lots of variety in my life, which is exactly the way I like it.</em></p>
<p><em>My Myers-Briggs type is INFP/J. I&rsquo;ve always scored right on the line between Perceiver and Judger and I often wish I were more J. For me, being a P has its drawbacks in the world of making decisions and getting things done. There are lots of things about being an INFP/J that suit all my different &ldquo;jobs&rdquo;&mdash;my ability to understand all sides of an argument, and the most fun of them all is my intuition. I&rsquo;ve finally learned to trust my intuition; coach training certainly worked wonders there. As an INF&rsquo; I have a mind that runs on two tracks simultaneously&mdash;I can see and imagine the big picture of an idea, really &ldquo;grokking&rdquo; the essence of an idea, and at the same time I can mentally create ways to make it happen. This works most of the time. Other times I get overwhelmed by the difficulties I see in the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and I then get uptight and controlling, which isn&rsquo;t much fun for anybody.</em></p>
<p><em>My favorite thing about CTI? First of all, I hate &ldquo;favorite questions!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have many favorites. There are a million things I love about working at CTI. I love the people. I love that we play, we laugh, we enjoy each other, we love each other, we laugh together, we cry together, we fail and say &ldquo;Ta-Da,&rdquo; we celebrate. We feel people unfold and blossom. I feel a part of something beautiful that is shifting and awakening in the universe.</em></p>
<p><em>When I finish a big project I like to celebrate first by feeling good about what I&rsquo;ve done. I feel the emotions that come with accomplishment: pride, satisfaction, joy, success, yippee, done, phew&mdash;all those feelings. I do like to jump up and down, be giddy and do that &ldquo;yes&rdquo; thing with my arms. Then, later, I settle into resting. I think that&rsquo;s one of my favorite things about a big push sometimes: when I can just do nothing, except read. You want a favorite? READING! And, back to celebrating, if I just happen to be around a good bartender, I&rsquo;ll have a Side-Car!</em></p>
<p><em>My biggest &ldquo;aha&rdquo; from my years at CTI&hellip;I spent 25+ years working for large corporations doing just a gazillion things and climbing all kinds of phantom ladders. Working, working, working. My &ldquo;aha&rdquo; at CTI is that while the things I &ldquo;do&rdquo; are important, they aren&rsquo;t nearly as important as the impact of the way I &ldquo;be.&rdquo; I know now that the way I love people, the compassion and wisdom I feel are priceless and have much more of an impact than anything I ever actually &ldquo;do.&rdquo; Living life from that place has me feel in my groove and on-purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>One thing I do better than anyone is be me. Nobody else can do that. I also make a great lemon cake. I&rsquo;ve also been told I look great in overalls, which is no easy feat.</em></p>
<p><em>You want to know what I still can&rsquo;t get the hang-of? Making food look pretty on a serving platter, gardening, allowing dogs to lick my face, not using the f-word too often, bowling, skiing without falling every five minutes, singing in tune, any math beyond algebra (which is long-gone and not needed), and then, of course, there is remembering that I am always loved, in every moment, and that I create my own reality! </em></p>
<p><strong>If you could coach anyone in the world (living or dead), who would you coach and why?</strong> This question always throws me. I don&rsquo;t know how to answer this one. Eleanor Roosevelt&mdash;an incredibly powerful woman, way ahead of her times. Love to hear her perspectives and to get to know her heart.<strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>What is your favorite food/recipe? What food do you despise?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Since I don&rsquo;t have favorites, I&rsquo;ll go with the scallop chowder my husband, Ken, made last weekend. My favorite dessert is the strawberry-rhubarb pie my mother makes. (Just writing that makes me feel a banana split screaming, &ldquo;You love me too!&rdquo;) I hate mayonnaise that isn&rsquo;t made by Best Foods, unless it is homemade.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t know that I&hellip;.</strong>was hell-on-wheels as a teenager. There is something about my demeanor that has people think I am really a goody-two-shoes, and I&rsquo;m not&mdash;even now.<strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>What are you often times found doing at 4 p.m. on any given Saturday afternoon?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">You can find me curled up with my husband, three cats, and a book on Saturday afternoon at 4 p.m. Nap time!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>What is the most glorious moment/accomplishment of your life? </strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">One of my most glorious moments was last year in Punta Mita, Mexico, at a Lucid Living Retreat. The experience there was of pure love and joy. Feeling bathed in the presence of the Divine, day after day. It was so&hellip;divine!</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Glorious accomplishment&mdash;I guess that would have to be graduating from college at the age of 45 after 15 years of taking classes all over the place&hellip;in three different countries, and night school in the States, while holding down a corporate management position during much of that time. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Who's your hero?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">I have a rather eclectic, rotating collection of heroes and heroines. Right now&hellip;Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Ellen Degeneres. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein will always stand-out for me, and Katharine Graham for supporting them. And, let&rsquo;s not forget Nemo&rsquo;s Dad. I also think Dori is someone special. She is not the least bit self-conscious about having no memory&mdash;imagine that! For a woman my age, she is quite the role-model!</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Where is your favorite place to play?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">My favorite place to play is along a river or a lake. Give me some sunshine, beautiful water, and trees and I&rsquo;m a happy, happy camper.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>What would we find at your desk?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Besides the usual piles of papers and folders&hellip;my desk has photos of my adorable husband, family, friends, kitty-cats, beautiful cards and gorgeous ribbon bows from gifts. I also have a &ldquo;bird clock&rdquo; that sings every hour, which is met with mixed reviews here at the office. Come in and check it out!<strong></strong></p>
