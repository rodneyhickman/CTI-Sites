<h1>What&rsquo;s Your Plan B?<br />
  <em>Creating financial wellness with passive  income</em></h1>
<p>As coaches, we are often solely responsible for our  financial well-being. Therefore, it&rsquo;s critical that we be mindful of how to  best leverage our time and resources. This has been a desire of mine for nearly  six years but not something that I actively tended to until almost three years  ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Co-Active coach and part of the CTI faculty. I live in  Mexico a few blocks from the Caribbean Sea, and I&rsquo;m living my dream. Since I  coach and lead workshops for a living, the only way I make money at that is  when I <em>personally</em> am talking to my  clients or standing in front of a classroom. What that means is if illness,  family emergencies or hurricanes (in my case) show up, the paychecks stop  coming in. So how can we coaches best ensure our financial health? Passive  income.</p>
<p>The idea here, of course, is to have your money work for  you, so that you make money while you sleep!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Robert T. Kiyosaki, author of the best  selling book, <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em>. I  even participated in his financial coaching program to get training and support  on how to create alternate income streams. So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve created:</p>
<p>First, I bought an old one-story home here in Mexico and  converted it into two one-bedroom apartments, which I now rent out. I built a  second story, which is where I live. The rental income from the two apartments  pays for the mortgage, taxes and upkeep of the entire house. I live for free!  My home is truly an asset because it is generating a positive cash flow. I also  bought some land a few years ago that I hope to develop one day. Yes, the land  has value and it&rsquo;s appreciating, but technically it is not an asset because it  is not generating income, so my land currently is a liability. Robert gave me a  whole new way to look at my finances and it was a huge eye-opener. Consider  reading his book titled <em>The Cash Flow  Quadrant</em>.</p>
<p>Secondly, I joined a network marketing company this year. I  know. I know what you must be thinking&hellip;pyramid scheme, those things never work,  you can&rsquo;t make money doing that, etc. Well, I tell you what&mdash;you might want to  do a little research because the MLM industry has changed dramatically in the  last 20 years. There are some excellent companies out there with strong, fair  compensation structures that do work and can offer substantial financial  rewards by working on a very part-time basis. The good ones will even let your  residual income go to a family member or loved one. I don&rsquo;t know how else we  could make such a low initial investment of time and energy with the  opportunity for such great financial rewards for a lifetime and beyond (even  when we stop working the business!). You might also want to read Robert&rsquo;s book <em>The Business School, for People Who Like  Helping People</em>. It&rsquo;s all about the network marketing industry and tells you  what you need to know to make it work for you. </p>
<p>Now, does owning a rental income property and being part of  a network marketing company require some time and attention? You bet&hellip;but not a  lot. And the rewards are more than worth it. I now know that I have two income  streams that can support me in case, for whatever reason, I no longer can or  want to do my day job. I have a Plan B. </p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki identifies six obstacles that must be  overcome to achieve financial freedom. They are:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>fear</li>
  <li>cynicism</li>
  <li>laziness</li>
  <li>bad       habits</li>
  <li>arrogance</li>
  <li>disappointment</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these resonate with you, work on them with your  coach. Then begin to brainstorm your own Plan B for residual income. Are you  drawn to investing? Real estate? Buying a business or a franchise? Or perhaps a  lower startup cost venture such as a network marketing company? Maybe it&rsquo;s time  to write that bestseller that&rsquo;s been on your brain. The key is to not let any  of the six obstacles keep you from securing your financial future.</p>
<p>We do really important work as coaches. I know that we are  making a contribution to mankind that is essential, inspiring and full of love.  We deserve, as I believe everyone does, an abundant life that is not dictated  by the size of our paycheck or what we charge for our services. What step will  you take this week to ensure a lifetime of financial wellness?</p>
