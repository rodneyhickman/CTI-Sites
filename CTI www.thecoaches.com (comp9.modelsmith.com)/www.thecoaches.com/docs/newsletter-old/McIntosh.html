<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Education From the Storm</h1>
<p>As an inspirational  speaker/writer and coach, I always enjoy presenting &ldquo;Run to Daylight:  Transforming Potential into Prosperity.&rdquo; It is the best when audience members  are encouraged to believe in the law of circulation, and to believe that one  good deed leads to another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good reminder for us  all as we try and balance our coaching businesses with the business of  community service. How, when, where should we give of ourselves without the  thought of financial compensation? When should we follow the immortal words of  the great Ralph Waldo Emerson, who once said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful  compensations of life: No man or woman can sincerely try to help another,  without helping themselves; serve and thou shall be served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A recent Colorado snowstorm reminded me of one possible answer to what  can be a challenging question as we try to balance life:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Dad, that was a nice  shot,&rdquo; complimented my eight-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>A powerful system had  descended upon Colorado&rsquo;s Front   Range. It was dumping  several inches of heavy, wet snow on our lawns and roads. It was of major  concern to us, especially because of two large and beautiful ash trees that  dominate the scenery in front of our home.</p>
<p>These moisture-intensive  storms that hit before the leaves fall wreak havoc with Colorado&rsquo;s trees. Too often, they snap under the unexpected  weight of the heavy and clingy precipitation. Rachel and I were throwing,  respectively, a soccer ball and basketball into the trees to knock snow off the  branches. My daughter was complimenting me for nailing one branch that was bent  over near its breaking point before being freed from the weight of the slushy  substance.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;throw the ball into  the trees&rdquo; method is something I had never tried. In fact, I had just been  introduced to the concept a few hours earlier, while driving home from work and  spotting a neighbor doing the same with her trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; squealed Rachel, her  school sweatshirt soaked from the snow. &ldquo;I finally hit that branch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I chased down the  basketball after an errant toss&mdash;hey, not ALL were accurate&mdash;another thought hit  me like a frozen snowball: here we were, outside in the freezing weather,  braving the elements, because we cared about the welfare of two ash trees? Is  that crazy? Or could it be a reminder of another great lesson of life?</p>
<p>Without our attention, those  trees were in serious danger of losing some major branches. We had to take  action to prevent them from snapping. It made me think of relationships&mdash;our  personal, professional and civic-minded relationships that so often feel the  strain similar to a branch laboring beneath heavy snow. Are we so quick to  respond in a way that will relieve the stress? Are we conscious of the burdens  that may exist?</p>
<p>These defenseless trees were  under assault from Mother Nature. It was quite easy to respond. It&rsquo;s quite a  different story isn&rsquo;t it, when our gut feeling is telling us we&rsquo;re betraying  our own self-good, perhaps taking money from our pockets, by assisting others  via community service, and not through compensation?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taught in many  different ways, languages and beliefs to be &ldquo;generous and compassionate&rdquo; toward  others, but could that possibly mean we would be crossing the line of not being  &ldquo;generous and compassionate&rdquo; to ourselves?</p>
<p>Bam. Another direct hit  brings slushy snow tumbling off the branches. Whoops! Another errant throw  sends the basketball across the street.</p>
<p>Another thought pops into my  head. Perhaps the answer to knowing when to respond or not is common sense. A  good example might be if an elderly neighbor, recently recovered from heart  surgery, were trying to throw basketballs into the trees in a rescue attempt.  They would need to ask for help.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same is true of  community service. When your gut feeling is suggesting involvement would  compromise your mental, physical or emotional health, it&rsquo;s time to ask someone  else to help. You don&rsquo;t have to ignore the problem, but you understand it would  be even more damaging, like the heart patient exerting too much effort, for you  to provide assistance.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not the case, grab  the ball and start firing away. The effort to help a healthy and productive  community effort, or organization, is well worth getting a little soaked and  damp because of the warmth that will emanate from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; my daughter  announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 10:30. Time to go  rent a movie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was snapped from my other  world. As I walked into the house and tossed all our damp clothes into the  dryer, I was hit with a strong sense of gratitude&mdash;for the woman who taught me  the ball trick, for my daughter&rsquo;s help, for the reminder to one of life&rsquo;s great  lessons: care for one another.</p>
<p>On this day, it was a group  of trees that needed help. Another day, again in the words of Emerson:  something or someone will &ldquo;vibrate that iron string&rdquo; within you.</p>
<p>Listen to it, that&rsquo;s where  you should serve.</p>
<p>That revelation led me to  speak and coach inmates within the Denver County detention facility. The recidivist rate is alarmingly high within those  walls. Too many men and women are returning to life behind bars instead of  becoming functioning members of our society.</p>
<p>The costs are enormous in  all areas: familial, societal and economic.</p>
<p>Victory Productions through  its inspirational presentations, publications and products is going to try to  make a difference, to try to be a spark that might encourage &ldquo;change&rdquo; in that  area. Isn&rsquo;t that what coaching is all about, to foster change?</p>
<p>Where could your time,  talents and treasures perhaps be a spark of hope?</p>
<p>What is rooted in &ldquo;one good  deed leads to another&rdquo; could someday lead to publicity of your good works  growing beyond your local community to more state, regional and national  organizations willing to compensate for your coaching expertise.</p>
<p>Think about it: what starts  with you giving of your time, talents and treasures can circulate and result in  rewards that stretch far beyond the financial.</p>
