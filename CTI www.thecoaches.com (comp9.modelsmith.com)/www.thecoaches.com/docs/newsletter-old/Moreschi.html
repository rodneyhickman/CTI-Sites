<h1>Coaching  the Primary Relationship: The One with Yourself</h1>
<p>A few years back, a potential client was  referred to me. Her opening line in our first conversation went something like  this: &ldquo;I want to create the love of my life walking through the door.&rdquo; In exploring  this desire of hers, it became clear that she wanted that &ldquo;love of her life&rdquo; to  make her feel safe, to help her feel better about her body and alleviate her  loneliness. </p>
<p>My response to her was that if she hired me as  her coach, we would focus on her relationship with herself. We would explore  how she could lovingly and meaningfully respond to these needs for herself. I  told her, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discover how <em>you</em> can  be the love of your life and then we&rsquo;ll see who walks through the door.&rdquo; She  agreed. And off we went into a deeply productive and satisfying coaching  relationship. She has given me permission to speak of our coaching experience  in this article.</p>
<p>During the course of our work together, we  focused on three specific topics:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Self-love</li>
  <li> Intimacy with  emotions</li>
  <li> Attuning to  multi-dimensionality</li>
</ol>
<h2>Self-Love</h2>
<p>In our first session, she commented that, &ldquo;Lots  of people talk about self-love, but I don&rsquo;t get what it really is.&rdquo; Our  exploration led her to discover that at its essence, loving yourself means accepting  and embracing <em>all</em> of you, the painful  and constricted aspects of you, as well as the beautiful and expansive aspects.  It is important to do all this without judgment, but instead with compassion  and spaciousness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I shared with her my perspective that as you  embrace and accept all of you, you begin to have the capacity to nurture  yourself and fulfill your needs. When you know that you are capable of meeting  your needs, you cease to believe in the mistaken notion that you need to go  &ldquo;out there&rdquo; to get from someone else what you can&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) provide for  yourself. From this place, you can look to &ldquo;what can I give&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;what  can I get&rdquo; from a relationship with a partner. This was a real revelation to my  client.</p>
<h2>Intimacy  With Emotions</h2>
<p>When my client and I moved into the domain of  exploring her relationship with her emotions, a similar question came up: &ldquo;I  hear people throw around the term &lsquo;emotions&rsquo; all the time, but what, exactly,  are emotions?&rdquo; My response: emotions are the synergy of thoughts <em>and</em> feelings. Emotions are at the heart  of every human relationship. Experiencing, expressing and communicating  emotions in a healthy, loving way is essential to having a mature, meaningful  relationship with yourself and with anyone else in your life, particularly a  life partner. </p>
<p>We human beings are filled with thoughts and  feelings all day and all night. However, our culture highly values the capacity  for thinking and mostly discounts the domain of feeling. So while we merrily go  about our daily lives focused on our thoughts, to the degree that we relegate  our feelings to the bottom of the heap of our conscious attention, we diminish  our access to the aliveness and true connectedness we seek in relationship.</p>
<p>My client and I worked to develop her  relationship with her emotional self by first simply slowing down and noticing  what was actually going on inside her. The very act of slowing down and putting  attention to the full range of her thoughts and feelings&mdash;again, without  judgment but with willingness to experience whatever was there&mdash;was the key to  helping her develop intimacy with her emotions.</p>
<h2>Attuning  to Multi-Dimensionality</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard ourselves say, &ldquo;Part of me says  this, but another part of me says that.&rdquo;&nbsp;  How often do we stop and really explore <em>which</em> part says what? When we open ourselves to explore what part  of us is speaking at any given moment, we are attuning to our own  multi-dimensionality. This self-awareness is vital to having a richer, more  intimate relationship with oneself, which ultimately translates to having a  more profound and connected relationship with another. </p>
<p>Over the course of our work together, my client  became able to consistently identify not only what she was thinking and  feeling, but what part of her was in charge of that thinking and feeling. She  discovered that it was the voice of her child inside that wanted somebody to  love her, so that she could finally feel safe. My client began to embrace and  heal her frightened child inside so that the child now feels securely loved by  her, the adult woman. She also discovered her adolescent&rsquo;s voice. That&rsquo;s the  one who wanted a good-looking guy to tell her how pretty she was. As she took  time to listen to that adolescent&rsquo;s need for approval and began genuinely  loving her adolescent, the need to find a man who thought she was beautiful  simply evaporated. She identified the parental voice within her that had years  ago been molded by the authority figures in her life, but had long since become  internalized. She was able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that internal &ldquo;critical parent&rdquo; voice  and instead turn to a &ldquo;nurturing parent&rdquo; that could help her to revel in her  own beauty, and embrace her shortcomings with compassion and tenderness. </p>
<p>After a year of this sacred work of cultivating  a loving relationship with herself, my client felt complete with our coaching  and went on her way in the world. About a year and a half later, I received an  elated phone call from her, in which she told me she was planning to be married.  She exuded great joy, and I could sense the maturity and wisdom that had  blossomed. </p>
<p>Her communication to me went something like  this: &ldquo;I know now what it is to truly love and embrace myself. And while I was  busy loving myself for the first time in my life, I attracted a relationship  that is completely different than any other I&rsquo;ve had. We are kind to one  another. We enjoy thinking of ways we can each give to each other. I don&rsquo;t need  him to tell me that I&rsquo;m beautiful, and guess what? He does tell me I&rsquo;m  beautiful, often!&nbsp; When he does, it is so  heart-felt. I smile when I realize that he offers me a reflection of how I  honestly see myself as beautiful. It just couldn&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo; She and I had a  marvelous moment of celebration together.</p>
<p>Ah, the joy of coaching!</p>
