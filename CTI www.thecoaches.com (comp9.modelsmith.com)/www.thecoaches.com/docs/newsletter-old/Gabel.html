<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>CTI Staff Profile -- Andrew Gabel </strong></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Andrew Gabel was born in Richmond, CA, on May 24, 1965, at 11:14 p.m. He happens to be a Gemini, Pisces moon, Capricorn rising, but is also the Operations and Support Manager here at CTI&mdash;though he has also worn every other hat imaginable, as you will soon discover. The first job he ever had in life was to clean his room or have it all raked out into the front yard&hellip;maybe this is why he is the holder of the CTI space in such an orderly and beautiful way? At any rate, when I asked him how he got to CTI he said, &ldquo;Sit back, I got a story.&rdquo; So do sit back, perhaps make yourself a cup of tea, and get ready to enjoy Andrew&rsquo;s story:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><em>I was working for a local dental management company in Greenbrae where Jeanine Mancusi was a dental consultant. I was the events coordinator, booking meetings nationwide and taking care of our on-site classroom as well. Jeanine was taking &ldquo;these coaching courses&rdquo; and thought she&rsquo;d connect up our classroom space as a possible venue for them. I then got in the middle and worked out renting the classroom to Laura, Karen and Henry for use. Jeanine let me know that I should keep my eye on them, as they would soon need an employee to help them because this coaching thing was going to explode, get popular, and would make a difference in the world someday. As time went on (a couple of months), I was getting more and more disenchanted with my current employer and decided to approach one of the founders to see what was possible. I walked up to Elaine Jaynes, thinking she was Karen Kimsey-House, and was told that she&rsquo;d send Karen out at the next break. I then met Karen, who told me that CTI was going to be getting an official office space in San Rafael in a couple of months and to sit tight and that we&rsquo;d connect later more formally.</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>About a month went by, when Karen asked me to join Laura, Henry and herself for lunch. I met the three most amazing people that day. Though powerful individually, the three together made an extremely dynamic whole. The power and authenticity that I experienced in those two hours had my head spinning. They said, &ldquo;We are out to help change the world. Coaching is going to be in every country someday. Will you work for us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think about it overnight.&rdquo; Henry jumped in and said, &ldquo;I want to know now!&rdquo;&nbsp;Well, I leapt for that proverbial trapeze and caught that bar so sure that I knew. I believed. I was going to work someplace that was going to foster a new way of being in the world.</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;"><em>Just about 10 years later, having gone from two to three courses a month to 12-15 a weekend, and one employee to 25 full-time employees, plus 100 faculty worldwide, I sit and look out around me and know in my bones how powerful it is when you simply jump for that trapeze and trust.</em></p>
<p>In many ways, Andrew&rsquo;s story is the story of CTI as well. They are interwoven and cannot be separated. Consequently, Andrew&rsquo;s job title has been an equal evolution, reflecting his growth with the company. He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it all. In the beginning, I booked space for our courses in hotels, while answering the phone and registering students for courses and answering their questions about what coaching is all about, while sending out brochures and shipping out course materials and prepping participants for their retreats. I&rsquo;m now in charge of the Co-Active Network and love collaborating with Kathy Curry, the Director of Marketing, on how to continually grow and support it. I&rsquo;m an ENFP. I float near the J and am only a really clear E on the whole thing so I love that I&rsquo;m in contact with &lsquo;the people&rsquo; again. I get to connect and give light to many people everyday. I am very lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew&rsquo;s favorite thing about working at CTI is:&nbsp; &ldquo;Change. Change. Change. There is no chance to get stagnant, both as a business participant in the coaching and leadership industry and as a human being. Plus, I love Chinese Chicken Salad Day, which is every Wednesday.&rdquo; His favorite way to celebrate after he&rsquo;s completed a demanding project is to stand up and dance around the office and create a playful Level 3 disturbance. No one is better than Andrew at being his authentic self, though this is a pretty big statement to make in front of a genuinely authentic group such as ours&mdash;do I hear a challenge? It does, however, seem that no one is better than Andrew at playing &ldquo;Bumble Boogie&rdquo; on the piano, or pickling beets, though he humbly says that he is still trying to get the hang of being a masterful tech support person for the Co-Active Network. We here at CTI know that he holds a high bar for himself.</p>
<p>In terms of being Co-Active on the job, Andrew says he feels so integrated in the skills of Co-Activity that he&rsquo;s become unconsciously competent with it all and that it is in his veins. He also says that the biggest aha he&rsquo;s discovered about himself is, &ldquo;The leader that was born inside me. The leader that loves to serve. It&rsquo;s the whole leader thing. Did I say leadership?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the only thing left that has not been covered by the previous questions is the fact that he is single and looking&hellip;</p>
