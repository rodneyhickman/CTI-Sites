Taming Your Gremlin

<p class="textHead">
The Revised Version of Taming Your Gremlin&reg; is now available!

<p>
<em>By Jane Massengill, LCSW/CPCC, Director of the Gremlin Taming Institute</em>

<p>
If you liked Rick Carson's book, Taming Your Gremlin&trade;, then you definitely won't want to miss his newly released Revised Edition, Taming Your Gremlin&reg; (A surprisingly simple method for getting out of your own way). This book is not merely a remake of the first version although you may recognize some familiar gremlins.  But you won't be bored.  On the contrary! If you have been looking for more when it comes to gremlin-taming&trade;, you will definitely find it here. 

<p>
This updated version was written with the intention to guide you to a deeper level in your own personal gremlin-taming practice. There are new workbook style exercises plus material from Rick's training programs that offer a very clear road map for getting out of your own way.  It's full of wonderful one-liners. Here are some of my favorites:

<blockquote class="textNormal">
"True love is not a wave; true love is the water."<br>
"Awareness is a tool."<br>
"The soul cannot rest so long as the identity denies it."<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
What I love the most about this book is that you get to know Rick Carson in a much deeper way.  He demonstrates a unique combination of simplicity and certainty that goes beyond words.  It's clear that he continues to practice his own gremlin-taming and shares many of those examples with us in this version.  He trusts this method without a shadow of a doubt.  And his message is crystal clear: through our own awareness we receive the gift of our very own life and the gift of being able to choose how we want to respond to this life in any single breath.

<p class="textHead">
Introducing this book to others is truly a gift.
