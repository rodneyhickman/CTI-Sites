Busting the Taboos of Motherhood

<p>
After a particularly hard day of being a mom, I had dinner with a small group of women. One of them, an acquaintance who's never had children, asked me how my son was doing.  I responded with a cheerful story about his adventures in preschool, clearly more than she wanted to hear.  Then she asked me, "Do you just LOVE being a mom?" I heard myself say, "Well to tell you the truth, sometimes it sucks!"  She was visibly shaken.  Another member of our dinner party quickly said that that was not HER experience at all (Her child is almost 30 years old).  Guilt and shame washed over me.  Later, I realized, wow!  I'd exposed a taboo.

<p>
It's taboo to dislike being a mother, resent or fear your child's endless demands, or to be bored, lonely or unfulfilled with mothering. And when we don't have permission to feel these taboo feelings, we wind up colluding with societal ideals: either the supermom who's got it all handled, or the mom who's quietly struggling because it's the "right" thing to do in the name of being a "good mother." These ideals are laden with guilt and shame.

<p>
In my niche coaching moms, we expose the taboo perspectives and feelings, thereby freeing up the energy that is used to deny them. This gives us access to an enormous source of power and creativity and liberates our very souls. The contribution a mom can make from that kind of freedom is what the world needs now.  And coaching moms are just the gals for the job.
