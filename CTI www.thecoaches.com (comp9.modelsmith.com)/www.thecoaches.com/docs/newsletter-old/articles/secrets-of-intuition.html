The Secrets of Intuition

As a coach, one of the things I rely on most is my intuition.  It gives me hints, clues and sometimes, loud broadcast messages about where a client is, what's next for them or what's getting in their way.  While the interpretation may not be correct, speaking my intuition usually assists a client to get clear, gain insight and move the coaching forward.  

<p>
In my practice, I also work with clients to develop their own intuition so that they can make better decisions and have more ease in their life.  The two most common places I see people get stuck are: not knowing how their intuition communicates with them and not trusting it.  Here are a few secrets I've discovered that you can use to develop your intuition, as well as your clients.

<p><ul>
<li>Practice using your intuition everyday.  Take time to get quiet and allow it to show you the way to honor your true self.

<br><br><li>Discover how your intuition communicates you-each person has their own unique intuition key.

<br><br><li>Know who's talking to you.  Is it a gremlin or your intuition?  Learn to distinguish between the two.

<br><br><li>Call on your future self.  There's nothing like your future self to step around the gremlins and get straight to your intuitive soul.

<br><br><li>Learn to trust it.  Start by making small decisions based on your intuition.  As you learn to trust it gradually start trusting on bigger and bigger decisions until you've built a good relationship with it.
</ul>

<p>
By using these secrets I've seen my clients' intuition as well as my own blossom, allowing decision making and my life to be much easier and more in alignment with my true self.
