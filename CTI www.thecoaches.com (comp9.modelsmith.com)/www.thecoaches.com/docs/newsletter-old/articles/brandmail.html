I wanted to share with you a service I have been using for several months that I absolutely love.  We coaches rely on email to communicate with our clients and prospects quickly and cost effectively.  I've discovered and use a new service called LetterClick BrandMail that also enables me to easily promote my professional image and my business while using email.  Every email I send becomes a letter-like business email with no extra steps or effort on my part.  BrandMail formats my every day email and adds my logo and signature.  It works great with new messages, replies and forwards and includes a list mailing feature that allows you to easily send out marketing letters to your client/prospect lists.<br>
<br>
Clients see me in a more professional light and they experience my email as more personal communication with additional care taken in its preparation and use - even though I don't have to do anything extra. BrandMail is very inexpensive to use.   I encourage you to try the service. I can tell you from personal experience that BrandMail has changed the way I present myself to the world.<br>
<br>
If you want to see a sample of what BrandMail looks like, drop me a line or go to www.letterclick.net.<br>
