<h1> How to Increase Your Income by Changing Your Relationship with Money</h1>
<p> Relationship Coaching is not just for relationships with other people. How 
  about your relationship with your career? Your body? Aspects of yourself? More 
  and more, I find myself coaching clients on their relationship with Money. </p>
<h2>My story: </h2>
<p> Until April of 2003, I was struggling with my coaching practice. I was having 
  trouble attracting clients who would pay the fee I wanted. I found myself avoiding 
  discussions of Money as long as I could. I was embarrassed by the whole subject, 
  and my discomfort translated into making clients uncomfortable, too. I was &quot;doing&quot; 
  all the right marketing things&#8212;networking, newsletters, sample sessions&#8212;and 
  getting nowhere. I was not making a &quot;grown-up&quot; living.</p>
<p>What was in my way, I wondered? My coach and I took a look at my relationship 
  with Money. What were my stories about Money? What is this entity I'm in relationship 
  with? What's going on with this relationship?</p>
<p>Two discoveries popped out: Money didn't feel safe or reliable, and Money caused 
  separation. (My family would swing between being rich and poor over and over 
  again, and Money was a &quot;reason&quot; for family members not to talk to 
  each other for decades.) If my experience of Money were given personhood, he'd 
  look like an unappealing, unclean, Hell's Angel biker type that I didn't want 
  to be around...someone untrustworthy who liked to cause fights. No wonder I 
  wasn't bringing Money into my life!</p>
<p>This was not the relationship with Money I wanted to have. (And it wasn't the 
  relationship I wanted to model for my clients, either.) So I created a new paradigm. 
  I fired the biker persona and put a romantic, soft-spoken suitor in his place. 
  I chose a new Money &quot;person&quot; to relate to. This Money was like a sweet 
  boyfriend who wooed me with gifts. He even wore a tux! Whenever I received a 
  check, signed a new client, came across some unexpected income, I would graciously 
  thank Money for the lovely gift. And this version of Money was valued and invited 
  into my life. </p>
<p>From then on, my business and income kept growing. Within six months, I had 
  accrued such a waiting list of clients, I had to add group coaching to my services. 
  I didn&#8217;t have to look for my new clients; they were finding me. And all 
  I had changed was my inner dialogue with Money.</p>
<h2> Your turn:</h2>
<p>Your financial situation is a manifestation of your relationship with an entity 
  called Money.</p>
<p align="center"><i>What are your stories about Money? </i></p>
<p align="center"><i>What beliefs get between you and prosperity? </i></p>
<p>If you're game to go here with me, look at how Money has shown up in your life 
  and in the lives around you. Think of the stories you've heard about Money when 
  growing up. Give Money personhood in relationship to you. If Money were a person, 
  what would your version of this Money &quot;person&quot; be like?</p>
<p align="center"><i>Who is Money? </i></p>
<p align="center"><i>How do you feel about Money?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Do you trust Money?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Does Money trust you?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>How does Money operate in your life?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>How does Money feel about you?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Is Money someone you'd want to have a relationship with if 
  you didn't &#8220;have to?&quot;</i></p>
<p>Now, take a step back and imagine looking at this relationship between yourself 
  and Money-as-a-person from the outside: </p>
<p align="center"><i>What shift needs to happen in this relationship?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Now, as yourself, negotiate with Money:</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Does Money have a request for you?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Do you have a request for Money?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>What's going to be different?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>How do you want to be different in this relationship?</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>What is the next step to making this change real?</i></p>
<p>Money is like any other relationship: it comes where it's invited and appreciated. 
  It rarely comes when it is chased. It can be your partner, if you listen to 
  it.<br>
