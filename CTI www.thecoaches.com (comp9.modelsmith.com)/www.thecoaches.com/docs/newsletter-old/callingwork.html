<h1> What Is the Calling at Work?</h1>
<p> When we &#8220;call&#8221; to each other, are we calling forth, calling out 
  or calling down? One way to check is to notice what is in &#8220;the space.&#8221; 
  By &#8220;in the space.&#8221; I mean to focus on the atmosphere, the feel, 
  your sense of what is &#8220;in the air&#8221; at this moment. We can sense 
  tension and glee and a whole range of attributes in a room and yet rarely stop 
  to notice the space unless the intensity of what is there is rather significant, 
  as in &#8220;You could cut the tension in the air with a knife.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  There are times when words can disguise a person&#8217;s true intentions. The 
  intensity is not overwhelming and we have learned to step over what is in the 
  space. Yet, we somehow feel something, a subtle disconnection, too small to 
  even pause over. The intent shows through the act. Something was put into the 
  space through the intention.<br>
  <br>
  The advice we are given is to call people forth, bring them to full potential, 
  empower everyone and success will be ours. Indeed.<br>
  <br>
  What are the thoughts that I carry into the phrase, &#8220;You can do better 
  than that&#8221;? The tone and body language that accompany the words will express 
  the underlying thoughts, the intention. Yet, sometimes the deliverer is practiced 
  at setting the words out there in nearly neutral, or, with even more practice, 
  in a way to suggest &#8220;calling forth.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not.<br>
  <br>
  What are the defining characteristics of each member of this triad? What is 
  the self-talk that the one saying the words is actually using in their mind 
  to support their real intent?<br>
  <br>
  &#8220;Calling down&#8221; is the act of attack upon the self-esteem. I call 
  you down by judging you as not good enough and by using labels to try to convince 
  you that my judgment of you is deserved. We all have examples of the types of 
  words and body language that fit into the &#8220;calling down&#8221; category. 
  One example might be, &#8220;You can do better than that,&#8221; with a question 
  mark at the end and maybe an implied trailer of &#8220;Yeah, right.&#8221; Feel 
  that one. What&#8217;s in the space now?<br>
  <br>
  It&#8217;s not the words.<br>
  <br>
  &#8220;Calling out&#8221; is an affront demanding that I meet you, high noon, 
  at the OK Corral and better be bringing a gun. Hmmmm? The source of this can 
  be that I am just having a really bad day and I want you to join me. At the 
  office, this might sound like, &#8220;You can do better than that,&#8221; with 
  an exclamation mark behind it, possibly with an implied trailer like, &#8220;or 
  else.&#8221; So, get into that experience and&#8230;what&#8217;s in the space?<br>
  <br>
  &#8220;Calling forth&#8221; is the art of expressing that I completely believe 
  in you and that I really know that &#8220;you can do better than that,&#8221; 
  because I see greatness, even magnificence in you. Calling forth accepts you 
  where you are without even a hint of anything but love. Yup, love. Love has 
  its place in business as it has its place in the whole world. Love calls forth 
  naturally, accepts fully, champions, cheerleads and welcomes the whole person 
  with every fiber. Delicious, to die for, limitless. Allow some of that into 
  your body, just let it in for a minute.<br>
  <br>
  What&#8217;s in the space now?<br>
  <br>
  What are some of the implied trailers for this type of calling? Try, &#8220;I 
  know you can,&#8221; or, &#8220;I believe in you.&#8221; What is the intention 
  you prefer to receive and what is the intention that will bring you to maximum 
  performance? Maximum performance arrives when we are motivated, confident, supported 
  and safe. Calling forth, from love, generates all of that and more. And it&#8217;s 
  not in the words.<br>
  <br>
  What is the intent that you believe will bring your employees to maximum performance? 
  We all know how to notice &#8220;what&#8217;s in the space,&#8221; so we all 
  know, at some level, the intentions under the words. Yeah, busted. They know, 
  even if we practice sounding just the way the book said we ought to, because 
  it&#8217;s not in the words.<br>
  <br>
