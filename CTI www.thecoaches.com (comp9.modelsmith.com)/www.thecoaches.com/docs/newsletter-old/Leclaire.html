<h1><strong>Embodying  Your Values</strong></h1>
<p>Somatic coaching provides a  foundation for exploration into the bliss of being in a body, of actually  inhabiting a body&mdash;something that is more difficult to do than most of us  imagine. I believe we live in a time when people are losing the ability to  think reflectively and feel deeply, and, thereby, tap in to our spiritual  nature or Essence. In response to the high value placed on progress,  performance and profitability, we rarely reside in our bodies anymore and may,  in fact, be living in the first disembodied culture. Nowhere is this more  evident than in business, where millions of individuals engage daily with  pulsating flat screens for hours on end. Our bodies have become slaves to  machines&hellip;information machines, entertaining machines, feeding machines,  diagnosing machines, money machines, exercising machines, machines for love.  Our flesh, our bones, our blood, our sweat and spit, our &quot;life juice&quot;  has nowhere to live.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>    Everyone tends to be busy these days  but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t be embodied. There is no doubt that my clients  are brilliant and busy people: scientists, artists, business leaders and  coaches. These wonderful people have refined intellects and, inevitably, many  deal with aching backs, muffled throats, pulled-up pelvises, squeezed bladders,  caved&ndash;in chests, and tugged-under tailbones. Each physical manifestation  reflects fear and unexpressed and/or unfulfilled aspects of Essence. </p>
  <p>    The first thing I do with a client  is to begin to cultivate body awareness. Through body-centered inquiry we map  their life story and what wants to be born, given life. Then we bring awareness  to just how their body is speaking its mind.&nbsp;  We do this through the daily practice of Body-Centered Breaks (BCBs). </p>
  <p>    I introduce and employ many different  methodologies depending on the level of self-awareness a given client has. The  Body-Centered Break is a body-focused inquiry and awareness meditation<strong> lasting only two minutes </strong><strong>and done whenever and wherever you are in  your day</strong>. The person doesn&rsquo;t have to go to the zendo, spa, health  center or yoga studio. All that is fine, but many clients won&rsquo;t find the time  for such self-care initially. Daily practice of BCBs (which are available on my  website and soon to be available in podcast) provide these immediate benefits  as described by coaching clients: calmness of mind, overall sense of  well-being, sharpened mental focus, reduced anxiety and rapid recovery from  stress.</p>
  <p>As part of the somatic coaching  process, I engage clients with profound questions about their physicality: How  do you use your body in your life? What areas of your body are numb? How do you  drag yourself around? What can&rsquo;t you penetrate? We explore events that may have  contributed to a certain somatic shape&hellip;like pulled-up shoulders, shallow breathing  and other classic shapes. For more advanced folks, I engage them in <em>Shapework.</em> This involves using physical  gesture to create empowered feeling states that are supportive of core values.  This work comes from my physical theatre background. We engage and create/shape  archetypal gestures including but not limited to: gathering, smashing, pulling,  dragging, throwing, penetrating, lifting and so on&hellip;to access deep knowing of  Essence and the living into what is most important to the client.</p>
  <p>
  The language of Essence expressed  through the body is: impulse, sound, image, sensation and feeling. A desire  will fire or arise, an impulse surfaces and infuses itself inside a sensation,  shaping a feeling, which forms thought. And most people think they are their thoughts!  Somatic coaching mines deeper territory that thought. I think of myself as an  awareness teacher working within the Co-Active Coaching relationship  model.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    It takes courage and encouragement  to do this work. All that is required is a headset.&nbsp; This makes for freedom of movement during  telephone sessions. I find the results to be stunning for people who are ready  to be free individuals living in a contracted culture. As I joke in public  talks: <em>America has tight hips.</em> Most  bodies that I observe in this country are like green garden hoses with kinks in  them. Mind kinks. This is because every thought you have reverberates through  and in your body. Every thought!</p>
  <p>    Everything in the universe is in a  constant state of expansion and contraction. A simple but profound BCB we use  mirrors the natural phenomenon of expansion and contraction. At its finest,  somatic coaching brings clients to the <em>experience</em> of Essence or ever-expanding joy and its minimum effort. It supports  individuals to know the power and wisdom of the body, which never lies. We tend  to misinterpret body intelligence but it never lies. Only the mind does that.  In my own case, until I was about 30 years old, if my mind didn&rsquo;t need my body  for transportation, it would have killed it. Presently, I understand that I  need my body not only to move around but for inner transformation, which is  what somatic coaching is about&hellip;discovering Essence through the inner landscape  of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
    We deal with our messy and turbulent  minds through the body in order to uncover our values and our true identity.  The so-called democratic society we live in and enjoy, for the most part, may  be considered normal; but the norm is usually a long way from natural. If you  want to know your natural core values, the ones you embody when you walk into a  room, the ones that speak more loudly than your words, you can choose to engage  with somatic inquiry and coaching.
