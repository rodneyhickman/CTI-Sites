<h1> Creating Community the Writer's Way </h1>
<p>When Charles Dickens&rsquo; fourth novel, <em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em>, was first serialized, Victorian London waited with bated breath to discover the fate of Little Nell. Upon her death, groups gathered to mourn her passing, sobbing and comforting each other for their unbearable loss. Charles Dickens, through the power of his words, created a community of readers bound together by their love of Little Nell. Such is the magic of good writing. <br>
  <br>
The words community and communication share the same root. While writing may be a solitary activity, it is one that never exists outside of community. Either you are writing for yourself in your journal, and thus more deeply connected to your community of inner voices, or you are writing for a particular group of people who share a common interest.<br>
<br>
The more you visualize the community you are writing for, the more intimate, direct<br>
and powerful your words become. Your words build bridges that connect you to all who come in contact with them. Your readers may not know each other and most of them probably won't know you, but when they share in knowledge and understanding they become a community&mdash;whether they are aware of it or not! <br>
<br>
Since humans could first communicate, stories have helped us to learn, to comprehend and to create a link between generations, allowing knowledge and wisdom to be passed on. Even in this day and age of media overload and shockingly superficial sound bites, a good story captures our imagination. Kids still sit around the fire telling ghost stories, bonding through sheer terror because it's &quot;not cool&quot; to show feelings any other way at a certain age. <br>
<br>
Who are the writers and what are the stories that have influenced you in your life? Which fairytales spurred your youthful creativity and defined the archetypal roles you later grappled with? What heroes and heroines did you most want to emulate? Which biographies most fascinated you? How has your coaching path been shaped by what you&rsquo;ve read in books and articles or on websites? <br>
<br>
When we really take a look at the way others&rsquo; words have influenced our lives, it can prove to be quite an awakening. When you think about this, perhaps it stirs in you the desire to make your website a true place of community, or to join in the Co-Active Network that brings us together to share our stories as we travel this sometimes challenging path. <br>
<br>
Always keep in mind that as you build your business, you can use your own special brand of words to attract a community of clients! Learn to write for your prospects, your niche&mdash;to really write for them&mdash;and you will find your business growing from a place of deep connection. When you develop an intimate voice that makes them feel held, seen and known, you will draw people to you like a fire on a cold night. Your words have the power to forge community. Never forget it.<br>
<br>
Writing is a path to community that is open to you in any moment. Right now, you could email a friend or client, or send a letter to a local paper. You could take a step toward a book that one day may be read by people in Prague and Beijing and Milan. One day, you may smile delightedly to see a stranger reading your book on a plane, just as you have smiled in times past when you&rsquo;ve<br>
seen them reading <em>Tuesdays With Morrie</em> or <em>Charlotte's Web</em> or <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> (!), or any of the other books you have loved so much.<br>
<br>
And if you choose writing as a path, know that you become part of a wondrous community of people who understand that we are each unique and each have a story to tell, and who have been given the courage to put their thoughts and ideas, and even their souls, onto paper.<br>
<br>
Right now, we (Stephanie and Mary) are dancing in the act of co-activity as we write this article. We are weaving our ideas together, creating one tapestry out of two heads and many threads! Pick up your pen and join us.<br>
