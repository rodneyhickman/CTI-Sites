<h1> Bringing Co-Activity Alive in Israel&mdash;and Beyond</h1>
<p>Imagine a room filled with 22 people. Half of them are Arabs and the other half Jews. All of them live in Israel and most of them have been taught since they were babies to distrust and disrespect the other. It appears that they have no common language and seemingly no desire to find one. They each blame the other for the situation in which they find themselves, and they communicate only in harmful and unproductive ways, if at all. </p>
<p>Now imagine this same room of people, who have come together to embrace a new way of being, a new way of relating to each other. Picture them learning to recognize each other as naturally creative, resourceful and whole, and learning to communicate with each other in a way that doesn&rsquo;t make anybody wrong. Imagine that they are learning to listen to each other at a whole new level and, as a result, are beginning to let go of some of the age-old hatred that has been programmed into them since birth. New friendships are born, new dialogues are started, new possibilities of thought and action are opened up, and new paths for a more hopeful future are explored.</p>
<p>Is this second scenario just a dream? Is it reality? No, not yet. But it will be, and hopefully soon. CTI courses have been offered in Israel for more than a year now, and up to this point, only Israeli Jews have been enrolled in them. The first group of Israeli coaches has graduated from Synergy, and several new series of courses are already underway. A number of the Israeli coaches are ready to go through Certification, and several are attending Leadership. However, in this imagined scenario, which has not yet occurred in actuality, both Jews and Arabs are enrolled in these courses, and are experiencing firsthand the magic and power of Co-Activity. They are learning together to design powerful alliances that result in a whole new way of being with and relating to each other. They are learning to see each other as bridges, instead of obstacles.</p>
<p>How will this become a reality? There are many in the CTI community, both in Israel and around the world, including a number of CTI leaders, who are actively working towards this goal: that one day soon, there will be Arabs in coaching classes, alongside the Israelis. Our dream is to have CTI courses with Israelis and Arabs as students in the same room, learning together to be Co-Active coaches. Our dream is to see both Israelis and Arabs in Certification and Leadership. Many of us see an even bigger dream beyond these dreams: the goal of bringing Co-Activity to the entire Middle East. </p>
<p>We believe that Co-Activity can be the foundation for a true and lasting peace in this region, and we are fiercely committed to it. We envision an Israel in harmony with her neighbors. We envision Israelis and Arabs seeing each other first as humans (not as the enemy), and being able to interact with each other from a place of curiosity and mutual respect. We believe that Israelis and Arabs can learn to dance in the moment and be with each other in an open and flexible way, full of possibility and hope. We believe that practicing the principal of deep democracy&mdash;listening to all the voices in the system, and believing that each and every one of them is important and has something to contribute&mdash;will make a profound difference. We believe in the capacity for real change and in the true beauty of every individual and every nation. We believe that Co-Activity can truly change the face of the Middle East.</p>
<p>About seven months ago, I started a mentoring program (as my Leadership project) to match CPCCs with beginning coaches enrolled in CTI classes in Israel. So far, I have matched nearly 50 sets of mentors and mentees, and the results have been amazing. I have been overwhelmed by the positive response to this program, as well as the kindness and dedication of the CTI community. I have also been struck by the prevalence of the vision that so many of us share&mdash;that by bringing Co-Active coaching and Co-Activity to Israel (and eventually the entire Middle East), we can help create a new reality for those living there, and in essence, for the whole world.</p>
<p>Many of these CPCCs who have agreed to mentor a new Israeli coach for a period of six months had never met an Israeli before, much less mentored one. This has resulted in an invaluable cross-cultural opportunity, for both the mentors and the Israeli mentees. One mentor coach said to me that she never before had even thought about Israel, and now when she hears something about Israel on the news, she pays special attention. Others have developed friendships with their mentees that will hopefully endure way beyond the time of their mentoring relationship.</p>
<p>For the mentor coach, participating in this program has presented a rich opportunity both to touch someone&rsquo;s life and to ignite the spark of Co-Activity in a new Israeli coach. The mentees have received the benefit of being mentored by a certified coach, and of learning first-hand what Co-Active coaching is all about. The hope is that these fledgling coaches in Israel will in turn go out into their communities and bring Co-Activity and Co-Active coaching to others. Together, both the mentors and the mentees are helping Co-Activity come alive in Israel&mdash;and beyond!</p>
<p>So it begins. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if, very soon, there are beginning Arab coaches that need mentoring as well? This mentoring program is just one small piece in the whole puzzle, but that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to work: one small piece at a time. We can all play a part in putting this puzzle together, by building upon our powerfully shared vision that Co-Activity is an integral part of creating a paradigm shift in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes open for that second scenario. Soon it will become a reality, born of huge passion, commitment, vision and the unbending belief that Co-Activity is the vehicle to inspire it all.<br>
