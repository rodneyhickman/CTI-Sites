<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Community Service: Source of Abundance and Fulfillment </h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Community service has been part of my life since I was an adolescent. It has been a way for me to fulfill my life purpose which is: &ldquo;To help create a world of peace, justice and community in which people create together with God a world that they envision.&rdquo; As fringe benefits, it has promoted my coaching business and created a flow of abundance and new experiences.</p>
<p>Through community service, I have created a sufficient flow of financial resources that I can work with clients on a pro bono basis or at whatever rate I decide I want to offer them. Recently I have spent more time in community service than working with paying clients. The pro bono coaching I have done has been with executive directors of non-profit organizations and with criminal offenders. This was to gain experience, receive referrals and because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>not</em> do it.</p>
<p>Being open to receiving financial reward in ways other than being paid has been a blessing. One form of community service, being generous in my financial contributions to good causes, I believe has returned to me many fold in other ways. I see this has also been &ldquo;payment&rdquo; for much of the time I have given through community service. </p>
<p>My local, regional and national spiritual communities have been the primary source of my clients and referrals. I offer workshops at our annual gathering and serve on a number of committees where I apply my coach training. This helps to keep me and my skills in the group&rsquo;s consciousness. </p>
<p>My experience with reduced rates for coaching has come from asking people to be my clients because I believed I could help them with the problems they had. These were nearly always people whom I believed could not pay my full fee. On the other hand, I have received a number of referrals and public endorsements from these clients. These comments were particularly effective because my spiritual community is a small enough group that prospective clients could hear positive comments from multiple people. </p>
<p>One of the most consistent services I have provided the Denver community has been to visit and lead workshops with persons who are in jail or prison. When I first received training as a Co-Active coach, I began to use my coaching skills with those I visit in jail. My access to inmates is through an organization, New Foundations Nonviolence Center, which I helped to start. I currently serve on its Board of Directors. This service is an expression of my life purpose.</p>
<p>My commitment has been to visit three inmates each week. Frequently, I visit one person for a number of months. After visiting inmates for years, I kept hearing about the many problems that result from being in jail, e.g., losing jobs, friends, belongings and housing, as well as being returned to jail for frivolous parole violations. I began to desire that there be many more resources for people who have been arrested. </p>
<p>Community service was leading me to new experiences. Eventually the then-director of New Foundations asked me if I would like to represent the Center to an organization called the Denver Reintegration Working Group&mdash;to help offenders reintegrate into the Denver metro community. When I read that e-mail, I felt something stir inside me that meant to me that this was something that was meant for me to do. At the first meeting, I heard about things being planned that were so exciting to me that I felt like I would burst. It was like an answer to prayer. </p>
<p>This work continued to grow in new directions, as I noticed the high frequency of drug and alcohol use and abuse associated with criminal behavior. I began to use my coaching skills to help inmates overcome these challenges. Community service was helping me to clarify my passion and deepen my sense of creating together with God.</p>
<p>Community service and pro bono coaching can be expressions of your life purpose, as well as ways to promote your coaching business and create a flow of abundance in your life. They are opportunities to learn more about yourself and create and explore new things. Stretch yourself and see what new things you can experience, in what new directions you will be drawn and what you can create.</p>
