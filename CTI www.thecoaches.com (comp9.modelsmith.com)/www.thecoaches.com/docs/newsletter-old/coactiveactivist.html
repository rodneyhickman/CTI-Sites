<h1> How to be a Co-Active Activist</h1>
<p> Before I began CTI training, I believed I had a clear vision of how the world 
  should be. In pursuit of that vision, I joined social change organizations that 
  shared my views, worked on political campaigns and protested to change unfair 
  practices that affected the quality of life in our community. Although I spoke 
  a politically correct Northern Californian dialect steeped in overtones of loving-kindness, 
  I came to realize how often I&#8217;d fall into the &#8220;us and them&#8221; 
  trap and scapegoat people who opposed my vision. Even after participating in 
  an intensive program for socially engaged Buddhism, a sense of righteousness 
  about my work still allowed me to imagine people who saw the world differently 
  than I did as &#8220;the enemy.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  Even in organizations devoted to social change, I began to question whether 
  our ability to effect change might depend on our ability to change the world 
  inside us. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that many of these organizations 
  were mired in the same dynamics of power and greed that they had optimistically 
  set out to oppose, and that many people on my side could not hear or tolerate 
  divergent viewpoints. I was surprised at how easy it was for people in humanitarian 
  organizations to take on tunnel vision and slip into shadow dynamics.<br>
  <br>
  After my CTI training, I began to hold activism in a new light. The principles 
  of co-activity helped shape my thinking. Activism did not have to loom so large 
  or be so tiring: one could start small and locally. Soon I began to spot activism 
  wherever I looked: my dear housemate who always reminded me of the changing 
  and often confusing recycling rules; my coaching client, an elementary teacher 
  in a very low-income public school, who fought for her students&#8217; rights 
  to obtain textbooks and other learning resources; the business owner at my favorite 
  organic restaurant who bought his pesticide-free produce from local farmers, 
  even when it was not always convenient or profitable.<br>
  <br>
  I also began to consider how I might learn more about my clients&#8217; desires 
  to make a difference. On their intake form, I began to ask if there was an issue 
  about which they felt passionate. I was excited when their answers illuminated 
  a whole new side of my clients. One client who said she felt &#8220;aimless 
  in all areas of her life&#8221; was able to passionately describe why she supported 
  Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The exploration of this passion often unlocked 
  another door, and I learned something new and surprising in the process. Another 
  client sold a corporate consulting firm to follow her spiritual teacher to South 
  Africa to work with underprivileged children. She now leads workshops that integrate 
  three of her most important passions: meditation, art and dreamwork. The trip 
  to South Africa opened a world of new possibility and gave her the faith to 
  follow these passions.<br>
  <br>
  I often ask myself how to integrate the work of coaching with activism. One 
  day it could be speaking my truth on a controversial issue. Another day it might 
  look like volunteering for a social change organization that I love. Recently, 
  it occurred to me that I could support socially responsible organizations by 
  giving a percentage of my proceeds to them. I will use the new coaching website 
  that I am creating to publicize some of the community organizations that I support. 
  I am also committed to offer pro-bono work for people who are working to make 
  a difference in the world.<br>
  <br>
  The process of writing this article and working on writing my first book on 
  Embodied Activism has helped to clarify how my views on activism have shifted. 
  These are the seven ways that I believe we can use CTI&#8217;s co-active coaching 
  model as we work towards making a difference in the world.<br>
  <br>
  1. Be it then see it. Making a difference in the outside world involves continuously 
  exploring our inner landscapes. If we want peace in the world, we can begin 
  by finding it inside ourselves, and in cultivating more of it in our lives. 
  How can we be more of what we want in the world? <br>
  <br>
  2. Create community. Find others who share your passion and espouse the social 
  changes that you want to make. Regular community gatherings can provide the 
  support needed to move forward. Ask what you can do to build your community. 
  Are there new, creative ways of building the bridges that can support our crossing 
  to a better future?<br>
  <br>
  3. Yes, and. The world of social change is full of black-and-white thinking. 
  What if we were able to maneuver our heated discussions from YES, BUT to YES, 
  AND? How would our conversations change? How would our world change? <br>
  <br>
  4. Listen deeply. In our CTI training, we learn that there are three levels 
  of listening. Tracking these levels is critical as we engage in dialogue, own 
  our leadership skills and hear divergent opinions. How can we listen with our 
  whole being?<br>
  <br>
  5. Balance the motion. In social change work, it is easy to get caught up in 
  an endless sea of &#8220;hot issues.&#8221; We can be most effective when we 
  create a plan of action that comes from our own wellspring of truth. Then we 
  can stop scurrying all over and mindfully focus our energy on what speaks to 
  us. From this deep place, we can be effective agents of change. What methods 
  help us to maintain a healthy balance between motion and stillness?<br>
  <br>
  6. Allow process time. Changing the world is no easy task. There are inevitable 
  challenges, necessary conflicts, and lots of chaos and confusion. It is important 
  to accept that this is just a part the process. A safe space to process the 
  shadow side of social change is so essential. Where is your safe space to process? 
  Who would you trust to hold the container?<br>
  <br>
  7. The power of perspective. The perspective that we choose to embrace is our 
  choice. We can always choose to focus on the negative, or celebrate the successes&#8212;even 
  the small ones can have a ripple effect. We can always ask: What are some alternative 
  perspectives? Which perspectives are the most empowering? <br>
