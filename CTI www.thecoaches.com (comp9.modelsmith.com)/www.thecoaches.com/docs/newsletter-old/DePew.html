<h1><strong>Love, Valor and Compassion:  Coaching Gay Couples</strong></h1>
<p>  I&rsquo;m at a party for Gay Pride. The host and his new boyfriend  sit on the couch. They&rsquo;ve been dating eight weeks. The host says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  how to do any of this. It&rsquo;s been 20 years since I&rsquo;ve been in a relationship.&rdquo;  When I tell them that I&rsquo;m a relationship coach, he seems interested, but when I  offer them a sample session, the host recoils, laughing. &ldquo;No way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If  it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;
<p>  This is not unlike the resistance of a heterosexual partner  to couples coaching, except that there&rsquo;s a subtly different energy about it. I  sensed the presence of what Faith and Marita (creators of CTI&rsquo;s Organization  and Relationship Coaching Systems program) call a ghost role&mdash;the time spirit of  homophobia. Gay men and lesbians still face greater risk forming relationships  than do our heterosexual friends. With all the legislative and social gains  we&rsquo;ve made in the last 35 years, LGBT people still may be endangering their  careers, their children and their families by choosing to be together. Even  those of us who have been out for most of our lives feel this undercurrent, a  hesitancy, an exaggerated sense of privacy, perhaps, that has come from years  of having to protect ourselves and those we love. While I don&rsquo;t want to dwell  on this, it&rsquo;s something that, in coaching gay couples, we are likely to  encounter along the way, and it&rsquo;s not to be ignored. As a coach, I&rsquo;m curious to  know how a couple wants to be with this, both in the world and in their  relationship. It may be because of this lingering homophobia that the question  of what we are trying to create in our relationships takes on a particular  power and importance.


<p>An even greater challenge than a couples&rsquo; resistance to  coaching, I&rsquo;ve found, is what I myself am bringing to the coaching&mdash;without my  knowing it at first. After a number of years as a coach, I felt I was pretty  good at viewing my clients as creative, whole and resourceful. When it came to  coaching couples, however, everything, it seemed&mdash;my family and work history, my  string of tragic love affairs&mdash;conspired to make me believe the opposite: by  their very nature, relationships were inflexible, broken and&mdash;well, let&rsquo;s face  it&mdash;beyond hope. Give me the lone wolf perspective any day. Here&rsquo;s how I learned  to love coaching gay couples the hard way, which is the way I seem to learn  most things.</p>
<p>Turn the clock back. It&rsquo;s January. I&rsquo;m in my first  Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching weekend. It&rsquo;s Saturday night. I  have been thoroughly demoralized by the first day. I&rsquo;ve forgotten everything I  ever learned as a coach. I have coached people who did not try to take care of  me when they acted&mdash;brilliantly, I might add&mdash;in the practice coaching scenarios  we were given. I wonder who in their right mind would ever <em>want</em> to coach couples. All of my own relationship stuff is up&mdash;let&rsquo;s  just say it&rsquo;s not pretty. I feel I have failed. Not one cell in my body feels  anything like shouting: TA DA! It is cold. It is dark. It is spitting sleet. I  am lost somewhere in Toronto on my way to meet the two men a friend has found  for me to coach. In short, dear reader, I am a mess. After finding the block of  apartments I ring the buzzer and am buzzed in. The door opens and before me  stands a man, six-foot-three, wearing a strapless gold lame gown and a red wig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be our coach,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I am. And you must be  Bob,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Tonight I&rsquo;m Vera. Come in. Come in.&rdquo;&nbsp; I excuse myself for being under-dressed.  &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says Vera. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can find you something that  fits. Can I get you something to drink?&rdquo; Bourbon, I want to say, just bring the  bottle, but I say, &ldquo;Tea please.&rdquo;&nbsp;  &ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; says Vera and leads me into the sitting room.</p>
<p>Enter Vera&rsquo;s partner, a shorter, stockier man in a silver  cocktail dress with blue sequined bodice. It&rsquo;s really quite stunning on him. I  think with the right hat, in low light, he might be mistaken for the Queen  Mother. So we settle ourselves, and I think it&rsquo;s my job to get back on track&mdash;do  some coaching here. What are the issues? What signals can I unfold?  (Apparently, I&rsquo;m not touching any of the several hundred that have already  presented themselves). They&rsquo;ve been together eight years&mdash;how are they doing  with monogamy, for starters? The truth is I am every bit as lost as I would be  were I still wandering the streets outside. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I begin. &ldquo;What would you say  you are trying to create in your
  relationship?&rdquo; Vera leans over. &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell? The Follies Bergere!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not until we have stopped laughing that I finally give  up my agenda. For the rest of the evening, they talk about their past  marriages, their grandchildren, what they love to do, how they communicate,  everything I could have ever wanted to know. What counts, and I tell them this  before I leave, two pots of tea later, is what they&rsquo;ve taught me: that they are  whole, resourceful and creative (ya, you bet!). That they can count on each  other for love and support. That they have community, joy and exuberance. That  they honor fun, play and inventiveness (and high fashion!). That it is an honor  to bear witness and share what they already know about themselves. They have a  great relationship, and I am inspired with hope for the world.</p>
<p>For me, it keeps coming back to what we are trying to create  in our relationships. What big dream do we bring to the table? Or, as Arnold  Mindell might put it, what is being dreamed through us? It&rsquo;s the question that  lay curled behind so much powerful longing in all my important relations, and  it&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;d never thought to ask out loud. When coaching couples,  it&rsquo;s the question I return to again and again, especially as the relationship&rsquo;s  purpose seems to be changing. One client&rsquo;s partner has just moved to a job in  another city. He cannot join him for six months. What they are now creating is  something different from what they were creating six months ago. Then I get  curious about what they intend to create once they both relocate. Some years  ago I heard Don Clark, author of <em>Loving  Someone Gay</em>, say that our job as gay men is to make love where love has  never been before. As I coach gay and lesbian couples, that&rsquo;s something I want  to remember. It&rsquo;s a noble calling, and I feel lucky for having heard and  answered it.</p>
