<h1><strong>Why You Should Bother W</strong><strong>ith the Bother of Getting a Coaching Credential</strong><strong> </strong></h1>
<p>I recently went through the very time-consuming process of  reinstating my MCC. I did it with a great deal of gratitude, because I realize  that I didn&rsquo;t always feel this way. And it allowed me a look back on how and  why I applied in the first place.</p>
<p>I fell in love with coaching in my first coaching course at  CTI. I remember there were some coaches sitting in the back of the room who, we  were told, were in the &ldquo;certification process.&rdquo; Wow, I thought, maybe that&rsquo;s  what makes you a masterful coach. All I knew was that I wanted this  certification. </p>
<p>On exam day, the members of the Horse Pod gathered at the  home of Karen and Henry Kimsey-House. We settled in various locations  throughout the house, eager to write what we knew about the coaching model.  Throughout the day, our names were called one by one to take our turns with the  oral exam (which took place in the bedroom). My heart was in my throat and I  could barely stay present, classic symptoms of test anxiety.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  I breathed a huge sigh of relief and cried tears of joy the  day Karen and Henry called to tell me I had indeed passed. The process had  called me forth into my commitment, and the CPPC&mdash;Certified  Personal/Professional Coach&mdash;designation meant that I had kept my word to  myself. I had a standing and a designation with an organization with which I  felt completely aligned, a designation in a profession that meant the world to  me.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  I didn&rsquo;t feel the same way about getting my MCC. As a proud,  now credential-carrying, member of the Co-Active community (the credential  having been re-named CPCC), I was less motivated to have another credential.  Besides, a piece of paper does not make you who you are, so why all this  rigamarole? Thankfully, however, my dear coach-friends championed and called me  forth, and I managed to complete the paperwork and be grandfathered in as a  Master Certified Coach. </p>
<p>When the MCC certificate came with my letter of  congratulations, I was surprised by how moved I was and how proud I felt,  especially since at the time it felt like I was going through the motions. And,  quite frankly, without all the support and encouragement from my friends, I  probably would not have done it. Getting reinstated, however, I realize I have  grown into an identity of &ldquo;elder&rdquo; in the coaching community. Now, when I talk  with prospective clients, the MCC serves as shorthand for &ldquo;someone with  experience.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The decision to become credentialed is very personal. The  process and the requirements can be painful, time-consuming or less than  perfect. Regardless, for me, it is a symbol of my commitment and my willingness  to embrace my identity as coach. And it gives me a sense of honoring the  profession. So, what initially felt like jumping through hoops now feels like  something that helps to open doors. I must have asked my Future Self for help  when I applied that first time years ago!</p>
