<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>A Sense of Service: Self, Community and World</strong></h1>
<p>For me,  building the foundations of service started at a young age. Those foundations  came through in childhood friendships and have found a life of their own  through me. Service environments give me a huge playground for skill building  and the mechanics of how to lead others in development&mdash;personally and as a  community. There are three areas to be created from: service in self, service  to community and service for the world.</p>
<p><strong>Service in Self</strong><br />
  I first  learned about a sense of service in self through my childhood best friend,  Jerri Lynn. When I was 10, she used to sneak into my house at sunrise and  whisper to me to wake up. She would have an eyeful of adventure. We would  usually have some chore of hers or mine to accomplish before we could take off  into the wide, open spaces of Wyoming and &ldquo;go ridin.&rdquo; (Horses, of course). She  was always willing to help me when I had something standing in the way of cutting  loose for the day. She made work seem like a very small thing with a big reward,  and it was always so much fun to be with her. I learned to whistle while I  worked and that people help each other because there&rsquo;s richness in  accomplishing something together even when it&rsquo;s not your chore. She taught me  to celebrate by recalling the smells, tastes, sounds and feelings of a hot  summer day, the sound of a guitar, and the complete exhilaration of riding at  extreme speeds in cutoffs and no shoes, bareback on a horse. To this day, she  helps me when I have a party, even when it&rsquo;s not about her. She gets excited  about working together for a bigger cause. We create memories and experiences,  and she gives her time and talents because it&rsquo;s part of who she is, and there&rsquo;s  always so much entertainment along the way. I have experienced deep  satisfaction from modeling her. She teaches me to serve the joy, wisdom and  love inside of me. I am lucky to have her still showing me the way 30 years  later. Long-range friendship is a beautiful thing, especially when together we  are able to give more than we could ever give alone.</p>
<p><strong>Service to Community</strong> <br />
  Several  years ago, I was approached by the local community college to help raise $14  million for a new campus. Although I had no experience in fundraising, I was a  poster child for single mothers who go to college while raising children. I  joined the steering committee and voluntarily began working with groups to  motivate people&rsquo;s resources towards a good cause. There is power in telling  your story. The president of the college and the head of the capital campaign  began taking me around to corporate boards and big company meetings. I told my  story passionately about how getting to go to college was a dream of mine and  that it had helped me be a more well-rounded person and be able to give back to  my children, the labor force and to my community. My story was an archetypal  story that gave many people hope. I helped others to dream about what was  possible for them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It was  during this experience that I began sharpening my skills as a leader, personal  coach, systems collaborator and dream maker. We began by creating a visionary  dream team that was made up of high-profile people in the community who came  from various backgrounds and industries. Together, we provided a strategic plan  that would set up a capital campaign diversifying funding opportunities. I  experienced great range in giving as I witnessed people who had much to give  and gave little, people who had much to give and gave a lot, people who had  little to give and gave none. And then the greatest of love and sacrifice&mdash;people  from low income who gave all they could, both in financial terms, and in time  and effort. What made these people so different? I think those who were able to  give generously knew the power of true service and were engaged in the vision.  The dream of a greater good was uncovered inside of them and they found joy and  purpose, as they were compelled to offer service to their community. I learned  about how to create a culture of philanthropy, along with the art of giving and  serving to my community. This place lies in the South on the medicine wheel,  representing hard and passionate work in the hot noonday sun&mdash;a place of true  fun, and spontaneous and successful accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>Service to the World</strong> <br />
  World service  has found its way to my door. I recently accepted (after many declines) a nine-month  position for the co-director of the Wright Tornado Recovery Project. Wright, WY,  was declared a national disaster on August 12, 2005, after an F2 tornado  touched down and affected 450 people&rsquo;s lives. Sixty FEMA temporary trailers  were brought into my little town with a population of 1,200 to give those who  lost their homes a place to live. I&rsquo;ve learned that pain can be transformed  into power by raising psychological awareness of the stages of disaster and of  the earth. Here&rsquo;s the essence of what we&rsquo;ve been doing: open-up dialogue. Get  people cross-culturally in the same room together and allow the collective  story to unfold. Magic happens! We are only here to reveal the story that  creates our history. It&rsquo;s already here. We just capture it and give it meaning  as we recognize it. We increase collaboration between Red Cross, someone who  owns an affected trailer park, a CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation, FEMA  and a person who speaks Spanish. We are all healing. We are the healer and the  people in need. We are all one. In this place, we come with our hands out in  gentle servitude&mdash;a humble welcoming. </p>
