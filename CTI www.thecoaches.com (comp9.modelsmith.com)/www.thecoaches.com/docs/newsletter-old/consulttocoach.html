<h1>  <strong>From Consultant to Coach: An Unlikely Journey</strong> </h1>
<p>Synchronicity (sometimes called coincidence) suggests a surprising or unexpected relationship or outcome. It is typically applied to multiple events that take place near the same point in time and aren&rsquo;t easily predicted or explained by conventional thinking or causality. For some, coincidence is divine and others routine. It is a matter of perspective. From my perspective, coincidence is an illusion brought about by the passage of time; what looks random or coincidental has concrete and replicable causes that occurred some time prior to the result or &ldquo;coincidence.&rdquo; And so when we encounter the result or effect, the cause is just a distant memory no longer connected in our minds to the result.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked around and wondered, &ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I never intended to be a coach or to have a coach. I have a talent for grooming great employees, but for me, the idea of coaching never really stuck. When I reflect on the path that brought me to this time and place, I wonder if there might have been a more direct and deliberate route. I was asked to write about how synchronicity created a turning point in my business. As I reflect, it is only what looks like coincidence and synchronicity that have brought me to write this very article.</p>
<p>In 2002, I &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; the <a href="http://www.enlightenedbusiness.com/"><u>Enlightened Business Institute</u></a> (EBI), the company I now lead. Being the pragmatist that I am, it was an unlikely discovery, though an even more unlikely chain of events occurred prior to it. They began like this: In 2001, a Buddhist monk visited Olympia where I live. With a spiritual path far from my radar screen, I attended the teaching to please my wife. He spoke of anger, ignorance and desire as the three poisons, the three feelings that, unless we are vigilant, can be counted on to &ldquo;poison&rdquo; every good thing we encounter in this life. I was hooked. </p>
<p>He asked me to begin a course in Buddhist philosophy that was recorded during a seven-year period by Geshe Michael Roach, a Princeton graduate, an American Buddhist monk and Vice President of one of the fastest growing diamond companies in New York City. I learned that Michael had also founded EBI to bring Buddhist principles into business and was in the midst of a three-year silent retreat.</p>
<p>And so &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; offered me a way to combine my management experience, spiritual beliefs and commitment to helping companies succeed. EBI was a startup and so I began as a part-time, unpaid vice president of marketing. The company offered training, consulting and&hellip;coaching. The president suggested that I enroll in the coaching program so he could get to know me and vice versa. So at this point, I was a volunteer VP and paying to be coached. I was skeptical to say the least.</p>
<p>In February 2003, the president moved on and asked if I would take over the company. I traveled to the Arizona high desert where the three-year retreat was winding down and met Michael Roach for a very unusual interview, the kind one might expect from a monk. The sun had set in the high desert. The temperature had dropped from 80 to about 40 degrees and we both stood, hands clasped, eyes locked shivering in the cold desert night&mdash;me in light pants and a tee shirt and he in his robes. Looking right through my eyes at what he could see of my past experience, he said, &ldquo;I was worried about your coming; but I know this will work.&rdquo; At Andin International Diamond Company, he would be called to Human Resources time and again to conduct this famous 15-second interview. I was hired. </p>
<p>Financially, coaching was EBI&rsquo;s mainstay. As I talked with other coaches, I grew uncomfortable with the company&rsquo;s packaged coaching program. The more I learned, the more I liked client-centered and not coach-centered models. I knew that to fully understand coaching, I needed to take training myself. I didn&rsquo;t know if I would coach clients as president of the company, but I knew I needed to know more. I enrolled at CTI and then in CTI&rsquo;s Certification program.</p>
<p>Today, EBI refers clients to seven coaches, including myself, and serves 35 clients on five continents. We are grooming coaches in Asia, Europe and Australia and have been asked to help design a Master Coach Certification Program in Southeast Asia. And so what is coincidence and what is simply &ldquo;good planning?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I might have expected any one of the steps that led me here, but I cannot in any way imagine predicting the entire path. Let&rsquo;s look at the chain of events.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Buddhist monk and Princeton graduate (and spiritual advisor to the company I would eventually lead) builds a $250 million diamond company while spending seven years training western teachers. </li>
  <li>Left-brain pragmatist (me) finds a spiritual teacher who directs him to </li>
  <li>undertake years of serious philosophical study.</li>
  <li>Pragmatist finds company melding business and Buddhism,</li>
  <li>becomes volunteer VP and paying coaching client (What was I thinking?),</li>
  <li>gives up $150,000 per year to become president earning about $30,000 per year. </li>
  <li>In search of the right coaching program, pragmatist studies coaching, becomes a successful coach and executive, and serves clients around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coincidence? Synchronicity? Let&rsquo;s revisit the definition: surprising outcome not easily predicted or explained. Sounds like a fit to me.</p>
<p>And now the qualifier&mdash;what I believe and teach about world view. My world view is rooted in cause and effect, not as in Newton but as in creating our every experience. In this world view, every thought, word and action creates imprints that are stored in our minds, waiting to ripen into similar results when circumstances are ready. In this view, coincidence, or synchronicity, is illusory; things only appear to be coincidental because of the passing of time. Our mental imprints wait and grow until conditions are right and they ripen into a result that seems to be random or coincidental because the result is separated from its cause in time. </p>
<p>How does this relate to the coincidence or synchronicity of my path? World view suggests that if my journey is a good one, that if I&rsquo;ve taken great pleasure in running a beautiful company and making money by helping people, that I&rsquo;ve created this reality. I began creating it by helping others in the past, by being there when someone needed help with money, career, wisdom or any other type of giving.</p>
<p>Does this world view make my journey any less wondrous? No. Does it ruin the notion of coincidence for all who believe differently? No. Does it lessen the role of optimism and hopefulness in our vision of the world? Not in the least. And so enjoy the coincidence of my path and that of your own, and be sure to create consciously through your thoughts, words and actions the type of future you want to see. It never hurts to hedge your bets. </p>
