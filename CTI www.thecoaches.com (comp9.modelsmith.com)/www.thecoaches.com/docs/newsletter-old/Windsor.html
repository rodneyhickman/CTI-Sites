<h1><strong>Coaching the Forbidden and Taboo</strong></h1>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">What can&rsquo;t you be with in  your coaching?</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">I&rsquo;m thrilled we are asking  this question this month! Sure, we&rsquo;re looking for what the client can&rsquo;t be with  in their life, but what about our hard stuff and the role it plays in the  coaching relationship? In my work with my husband, Craig Carr, to develop <strong><em>Danger,  Sex and Magic&trade;: Coaching the Forbidden and Taboo,</em></strong> we&rsquo;ve identified  &ldquo;danger areas&rdquo; and are sharing new ways we&rsquo;ve found to navigate through them.  Rather than stepping over golden opportunities that scare us at first blush, we  want to see coaches courageously take on the vibrant challenge of  &ldquo;taboo-busting,&rdquo; and be willing to move with clients into the great depths of  the unknown.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">I have listened to hundreds  of coaching hours in supervision over the years, and the most glaring thing I  see related to what coaches can&rsquo;t be with occurs when a client&rsquo;s life  experience exists outside the realm of the coach&rsquo;s belief system. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Here&rsquo;s an example of what I  mean: A client came to a call very much wanting to talk about her sexual  relationship with her partner. (The coach had done a great job training her  about our whole life focus!) The coach proceeded to masterfully side-step the  conversation by picking an accountability from the last call and managed to  keep the coaching there for the entire session. When I asked the coach what  happened, she very pointedly said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I was going to go there. I  don&rsquo;t want to talk about things like that! I don&rsquo;t have conversations like that  with anyone, let alone a client!&rdquo;</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">So let&rsquo;s be clear about what  happened here. The forbidden territory they were in had nothing to do with the  client&mdash;it was all the coach&rsquo;s taboo stuff! Remember, when done well &ldquo;a  Co-Active coach does whatever it takes&rdquo; (Synergy!), and creating a  coaching conversation that is alive and resonant has within it the capacity to  be very intimate and very vulnerable for both coach and client. The powerfully  designed coaching relationship asks that both participants go to deep levels of  openness, and then forward that trust and awareness into realms of unknown territory.  In the above example, the coach&rsquo;s decision to not explore the territory had  tremendous impact on the relationship and the range of the coaching. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Craig and I feel this  conversation is so vital to coaches that we have started a blog at <a href="http://web.mac.com/jilwindsor/iWeb/Site/Home.html">http://web.mac.com/jilwindsor/iWeb/Site/Home.html</a>,  and we invite you participate in the conversation. Come and share your taboo  adventures, stumbles and successes, and we will share our insights and support  you on your journey. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">My guess is that if you have  been coaching for a while, you have had a few experiences in which your palms  go clammy, your heart pounds, your head buzzes, your mouth goes dry and all  sense of knowing seems to fly out of the window! If that sounds like you have  arrived in what we call the &ldquo;Land of Taboo,&rdquo; you would be correct. In <em>Danger, Sex and Magic</em> (DSM), we feel  this &ldquo;Danger Zone&rdquo; is an area that exists in and out of coaching, and we are  constantly being called forth to acknowledge it. We want you to trust that it  happens for a reason and that you are fully equipped to not only handle these  moments but to look forward to them and love the adventure. We believe that in  these precious moments we are being awakened, and we&rsquo;re sure many of you are  aware that this is one of the primary reasons you chose to be a coach in the  first place.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">In DSM, we devised the  &ldquo;Wheel of Generative Energy&rdquo; to identify eight primary areas where these  Danger/Taboo dynamics tend to show up. The energies are: <strong><em>Vulnerability, Magnetism and  Attraction, Sacred and Divine, Passion and Desire, Body Awareness and  Sensuality, Playfulness and Delight, Creativity </em></strong>and<strong><em> Sexuality.</em></strong> (For expanded  definitions go to the glossary at <a href="http://web.mac.com/jilwindsor/iWeb/Site/Home.html">http://web.mac.com/jilwindsor/iWeb/Site/Home.html</a>.

 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Now think of a client or  client situation. The first one to come to mind is probably the perfect one&mdash;and  the hardest! With all degree of honesty and on a 0-10 scale, write down the  &ldquo;Generative Energies&rdquo; and rate the degree each energy is being expressed in  this coaching. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">&hellip;Wasn&rsquo;t that fun? How many  qualities are below a 6 and how many are above? Do the exercise with a few more  clients in mind and look for patterns. Which generative energy seems to be most  excluded from your coaching? Which ones do you rely on most? Now, let&rsquo;s take  this a step further. Apply the Generative Energies to yourself to get a better  understanding of your danger and taboo areas. This explores which qualities are  getting short shrift in your own life and the cost to your aliveness. One thing  we know for sure is that what you do or don&rsquo;t do in your life will be  re-created in the coaching relationship. It has to; it&rsquo;s a natural phenomenon.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Now that you recognize where  some of your forbidden and taboo areas are located, it&rsquo;s time to take action  that will include them and stop them from running your coaching (and your  life!). Do this: pick one of the low-rated Generative Energies and write out a  list of ways you could express it. Yes, this will start the energy of Forbidden  and Taboo. Pay attention; get to know how it feels. Listen to internal  dialogue; feel the resistance. Now pick three ways from your list and share  them on the blog. You know what comes next&mdash;DO IT!</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">I look forward to you  joining us to continue this rich discussion. There is much to be learned here  for all of us. Your work as a coach is precious and a gift. Your clients and  their lives are precious. Thank you for being in this incredible generative  dance of becoming.</p>
