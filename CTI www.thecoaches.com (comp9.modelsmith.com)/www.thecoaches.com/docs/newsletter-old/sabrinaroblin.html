<h1> How to Create Ritual with Coaching </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ritual and coaching is an exciting topic for me to write about as I have experienced first-hand the depth and richness that Co-Active coaching can bring to the transformative process of ritual. Whether it&rsquo;s a large production with many witnesses or a private ritual with no witnesses, powerful questions, accountability, intuition and inquiry are just a few of the many Co-Active coaching skills that expand the ritual experience for my clients and have them get the most value and learning as they go through the ritual process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ritual and ceremony have been a part of the human experience for thousands of years and are most recognized as an acknowledgement of a major life transition such as a birth, death or marriage. Ritual is a powerful and transformative tool that supports and facilitates the challenge of incorporating any kind of life change, whether it be joyful or grievous&mdash;such as loss of a relationship or a job, moving into a new home, or contracting/overcoming an illness. It is also a specific event and structure in time that the client and coach can refer back to whenever needed for meaning or inspiration. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In workshops, I have used ritual in many ways. It brings a whole new dimension to the participants, as it impacts the individual being witnessed in the ritual act and those who are witnessing them. Ways I&rsquo;ve used ritual in workshops are to mark the entry point of a workshop as a time to release any expectations or everyday worries and open to whatever the workshop will bring for them, to anchor a commitment to a new way of being, or to release an old way of being that is getting in the way of their fulfillment. Once all the participants have gone through the ritual, I use coaching skills to debrief the process, deepening the learning around it and further anchoring the commitments that have been made.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With a workshop, I create a ritual ahead of time for the participants to go through that serves the overall intent of the workshop and then use coaching skills in the debrief. With individual clients, the ritual is created by the client within the container of the coaching relationship. One of the things that may differ with a client is that the process may not be witnessed. That depends on the need of the client and the intent behind the ritual. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are four stages of any ritual process. They are: planning, preparation, manifestation and incorporation. Each stage is enriched for the client through coaching. When working with your client to plan and design a ritual, use coaching to help them clearly define the intention and outcome of the ritual, and have them consider all of their senses as they go through the planning. Will there be music, candles, incense, an altar cloth of a certain color? What meaningful objects will be included? How will they use their body (walk across a line, crumple paper, dance, yell, etc.)? Will it be outside or inside? Will it incorporate aspects of their spiritual tradition?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The preparation stage is when the client gathers all his/her materials for the ritual and contacts witnesses, if they desire that as part of the event. Don&rsquo;t count yourself out as a witness, if this is what your client desires. The energetic presence and support of the coach can make a difference even over the phone. Preparation can be a difficult stage as resistance in the form of the internal gremlin/saboteur can pop up wanting to keep the client where she/he is. The more transformative the coming ritual will be for the client, the louder the gremlin/saboteur will grumble.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The manifestation stage is the actual enactment of the ritual. This stage can be as short as a few minutes or as long as several days, depending on what has been planned. For even a short, simple ritual, it&rsquo;s important to have something that marks the difference between when you are in a ritual space and when you are not. This can be as simple as lighting a candle before you begin and extinguishing the candle when the ritual is complete, or as complex as a traditional wedding set up with flowers, special clothing, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The incorporation stage is the time after the ritual when the client is integrating the experience. This stage can last days, weeks or months depending on the significance and impact of the event. If the client made a commitment during the ritual, during this time the client will be tested on resolve. This stage is where coaching becomes an incredibly valuable part of the process, as your skills can be used to hold the client accountable and deepen the learning as the experience is integrated. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have many more rituals in our lives than we imagine at first glance. There are the recognized regular rituals of our lives, such as our birthdays, anniversaries and holidays, and then there are the ones we may not recognize as rituals: the way we bathe, brush our teeth and prepare for our day in the morning, and any spiritual practices we might have such as the way we pray or the type of church service we attend. The more awareness and intention we bring to our everyday rituals and ceremonies and the ones we design for a specific intent, the more depth and richness we bring to our lives and the lives of our clients. Through it, we open doors to new levels of awareness, connectedness and growth in ourselves and with others.</p>
