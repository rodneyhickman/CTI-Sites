<h1>IS PROCRASTINATION HOLDING YOU BACK?</h1>

<h2>C.J. Hayden, MCC, CPCC </h2>

<p>
When you look at your marketing to-do list, do many of the
items on it look all too familiar? Have entries like "call
Donna Sanchez" and "follow up with Floyd Corp." been copied
from a previous week? Putting off unappealing tasks may be
human nature, but for an entrepreneur, procrastination can
be deadly. 

<p>
Delays in contacting a prospect can lose the business to the
competition. Failing to get the word out about an upcoming
event may forfeit dozens of opportunities. Wasted marketing
time can never be recovered. By the time you realize you
might not make your goal for the month, quarter, or year, it
may already be too late.

<p>
Finding tasks on your to-do list week after week is a clear
sign you are procrastinating, but it's not always this
obvious. Can you identify with any of these situations?

<p>
1. Feelings of overwhelm. You have a backlog of work that
seems insurmountable. You wake up in the morning already
thinking about everything you must accomplish that day. It
seems impossible to get it all done. If you are routinely
unable to complete what's on your list in the time
available, you may be creating the problem yourself by
putting tasks off week after week.

<p>
2. Making excuses. You find yourself constantly having to
make excuses to your business buddies, referral partners,
potential clients, or even your coach about why you never
followed up on that great referral, that important sales
call wasn't made, the marketing package wasn't sent, or the
proposal wasn't written. After a while, the excuses begin to
sound flimsy, even to you.

<p>
3. Trivial pursuits. You notice that you are doing
unimportant chores -- rearranging your desk drawers, filing
old business cards, shopping for just the right desk,
surfing the Net -- while neglecting crucial marketing
activities.

<p>
4. Overflowing pipeline. A form of procrastination unique to
entrepreneurs and salespeople is continuing to develop new
leads instead of contacting the prospects you already have.
If you are spending more time attending networking events or
reviewing lists of names than getting on the phone, putting
your fingers to the keyboard, or driving to appointments,
this problem may be yours.

<p>
If you ARE procrastinating, what then? Begin to change this
habit by getting in touch with your motivation to do better.
What rewards, tangible and intangible, do you get from your
work? Remind yourself of that payoff on a daily basis. Post
a picture or note that represents those rewards to you on
your calendar, phone, or dashboard.

<p>
Break down each of the activities you are having trouble
with into small steps. Pick what seems like the easiest
place to start, and block out time on your calendar to make
a beginning. You may find that once you are taking action,
the rest seems much less difficult than you had feared.
If you find that you really do have too much on your plate
to have enough time for marketing, it's essential that you
cut back on some of your other activities immediately. A
business without marketing isn't a business; it's a hobby.
Create more accountability for yourself by telling a buddy,
support group, or coach exactly what you plan to get done
each week. Ask them not to accept any excuses from you, and
to remind you why you said you were doing all this in the
first place. You can partner in this way with a colleague by
setting up a weekly check-in where each of you reports to
the other.

<p>
It may take time to break the procrastination habit, so give
yourself permission to fail a few times. Remember that even
a small amount of progress may be allowing you to achieve
more than you ever have before.

<p>
Here's to getting it done,<br>
