<h1>Start Designing Alliances Now</h1>
<p>A  lot of these articles are written by super-coaches with tons of experience. But  I&rsquo;m writing this article for those of us in Organization and Relationship  Systems Coaching courses right now: to share some experiences and to encourage  you to get out there and start experimenting with the work.</p>
<p>So  far, I&rsquo;ve taken Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching Fundamentals and  plan to finish the rest of the program in the next few months. But groups  aren&rsquo;t new to me.&nbsp; When I started my  coaches training two years ago, it was preceded by seven years of studying  improvisation &amp; performance psychology for co-creative best practices. I&rsquo;ve  also been working the past 20 years in advertising, telling stories and  moderating focus groups. So from the beginning, my interest as a coach has  always been on what I call Group Creative Process: what and how people make  what they make together. I also use theatre games for connecting people to  their authenticity and spontaneity, and for building group skills. </p>
<p><strong>Designing the  Partnership Alliance</strong> is one of the first exercises of OSRC Fundamentals and can  be summed up by the quiet inquiry: How do we want to be together? Our  instructor, Marita, told a story of another student making a commitment to do  50 free Designing the Partnership Alliance (DPA) sessions before her next  course. That challenge resonated with me. So on Monday, I sent an email to my  community offering a free DPA and received about 25 responses in the first two  weeks. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been working as much as possible with romantic couples  and small businesses (mostly still for one free session), and charging  corporate clients for DPA work. Corporations really need this work. Everyone  talks about the importance of good relationships, but where do we learn these  skills? What part of our work day is generally budgeted for &ldquo;relationship  building?&rdquo; </p>
<p>If  I have any advice, it&rsquo;s to jump right in. For most people, the experience of  consciously and intentionally designing their alliance for an hour adds  immediate value. Start with the idea that your client is the &ldquo;third entity&rdquo;  (the relationship they are creating together rather than the two separate  parts) to introduce them to systems thinking. Be curious: What does the  relationship want? This perspective opens the conceptual space for the OSRC  model to unfold. Here are the five basic questions I use for Designing the  Partnership Alliance:</p>
<p>&bull;  What kind of atmosphere or culture do you want to create together? <br />
  &bull;  How would that feel? What would help you feel that?<br />
  &bull;  What would help this partnership flourish? Define &ldquo;flourish.&rdquo;<br />
  &bull;  What do you want your partner(s) to be able to count on you for?<br />
  &bull;  How do you want to be when someone drops the ball or things get difficult?</p>
<p><strong>Take It to the  Bank</strong> <br />
  While  your clients are answering these questions to each other, listen to the form  enveloping the content (or story) of what&rsquo;s being said, to keep your focus on  the relatedness rather than the partners. </p>
<p>As  an example, during a day-long session with a marketing company and its  manufacturing client, the issue was raised that deadlines were frequently  missed. Rather than forge head-first into requirements, processes and  accountability, we took a step back to discover what this meant to the team.  People from the manufacturer shared about the company&rsquo;s internal culture, about  the difficulties of managing their bosses. Team members from the marketing  company shared how missed deadlines and time crunches challenge their ability  to staff properly and negatively impact their profitability. Team members were able  to diffuse the tension around the issue by trusting enough to reveal themselves  and to listen to their partners to find shared values. Then, we brainstormed  ways the marketing company could help the manufacturers deal with the clients&rsquo;  organization. And in the end, the team decided that since the timing pressures  were not likely to improve, compensation agreements and staffing plans needed  to be revisited. The trust work helped this group air, understand and address a  recurring problem in a positive way that was based on shared values, not  conflicting positions.</p>
<p>The  DPA questions open the space for team members to state their best intentions up  front, before problems arise, creating a bank of shared values, trust and  goodwill. I remind the team that at moments of conflict, we have a choice of  whether to assume the best intentions of our partners versus assuming the worst  intentions. On stage, in improv, we call this &ldquo;Making Your Partner Look Good.&rdquo; As  the trust deepens, encourage the team to create an image or flag or song or set  of code words that capture the essence of their best intentions, as a reminder  and as a touchstone to re-establish their trust in the future when the process  gets confusing or difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Building Trust</strong> <br />
  I  position trust-building work as a way for a team to experience both  vulnerability and safety at the same time. The vulnerability allows team  members to learn about themselves and partners, and to more easily access their  spontaneous and creative selves. Importantly, they are doing this together, not  individually. The safety makes it easier for the team to get back to that  creative and open place again. What if a team envisioned shared goodwill as a  delicious co-created pie? What if members could have a metaphorical slice of  this yummy pie at the weekly status meeting every Tuesday morning?</p>
<p>My  trust-building work frequently involves playing games from improvisational  theatre. Some games happen quietly, in pairs. Others are more active and  involve the whole group. Improv started as a tool for learning, not for  entertainment, and the games we play with corporate teams don&rsquo;t have much in  common with what you might see in a comedy club or on television. </p>
<p>Improv  games are fun ways for people to deepen connections by telling stories of peak  experiences or to discover things about their partners that are new. Games of  any kind are great for adding variety to the energy and tempo of a day-long  session. Lastly, improv in the office or on stage helps people connect better  to their bodies and feelings. I also use these games to model and practice  listening skills and build on ideas. In improvisational theatre and dance, we  play a game called &ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;.&rdquo; For an OSRC coach, you&rsquo;ll see a big difference  in the emotional field created when players respond to an idea with &ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;&rdquo;  versus &ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Process,  Benefits and Outcomes</strong> <br />
  In  my proposals, I remind my clients that they spend tens of thousands of dollars  pitching new business, yet have virtually no budgets for growing existing  relationships. When they lose a client, they frequently don&rsquo;t really know why.  Like lots of people, they focus on work deliverables and have zero relationship  strategy. </p>
<p>My  clients are well-versed in the language of consumer benefit: What will we get  out of this? It can be a bit tricky at first, learning how to position  organizational coaching services. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of talking  about your work in terms of what you will do together in-session. But while  clients may want to know something about the process, knowledge of how the  process works is not necessary for the team to benefit. Additionally, your  process is probably not a way to differentiate yourself from other coaches.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I  try to position my session designs (or &ldquo;scores,&rdquo; as in music) as deliberately  incomplete: requiring collaboration and experience to make them whole. A good  score for a day&rsquo;s session might include an assessment tool and some games to  deepen the learning, some trust building exercises, a DPA and some explorations  of shared definitions of success.</p>
<p>Talking  about session designs as &ldquo;scores&rdquo; also gives me an opportunity to emphasize  that relationship coaching is not a function box. There&rsquo;s not a prescribed  outcome. Rather, my job is to help create an <em>environment</em> in which teams can design and develop the relationship  they want. It&rsquo;s sometimes a challenge to manage one&rsquo;s own &ldquo;consultant  perspective&rdquo; when clients start asking tough questions about how things will  change for them based on the coaching. In response, try emphasizing your  clients&rsquo; power, responsibility and resourcefulness in relationship.</p>
<p>DPA  is an easy way to introduce systems work to teams and partnerships, and a great  tool to experiment with and practice relationship coaching. Scout around in  your niche; all around us, people are involved in making together that which is  unavailable to them alone. That&rsquo;s the reason people work in teams. Even a  little systems knowledge goes a long way, since the change of perspective from  a group of individuals to a system is so powerful. Since the time of Rene  Descartes, the western world has been building a cult of individualism. But my  reading of the global emotional field is that we&rsquo;re ready for some new ways of  relating to each other.<br />
