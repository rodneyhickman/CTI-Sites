<h1><strong>Visioning in the  Imagination with Guided Imagery</strong></h1>
<p>I am delighted that visioning is the month&rsquo;s topic, as I  have had some very powerful visions over the years in my &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; through  visualization and guided imagery. These images have enriched my life. </p>
<p>These techniques work magnificently in coaching and are very  similar to what you have been trained to do as a coach. When you are coaching,  you probably use metaphor and non-directive curious questions. So, in this  article I&rsquo;d like to give you some strategies that can deepen your clients&rsquo;  inner vision.</p>
<p>The key differences between coaching and guided imagery lie  in the &ldquo;<em>induction</em>&rdquo; (imagery is done  in a relaxed state of focused attention), and the <em>interactive</em> aspect, in which the client exchanges information with  the image. </p>
<p>Before becoming a coach, I received training and  certification in the technique called Interactive Guided Imagery(sm)&nbsp; (IGIsm). Taught by the  Academy of Guided Imagery, it brings the client into a state of highly focused  concentration using sensory information. It engages the imagination by  bypassing the conscious mind in order to access the unconscious. This becomes  possible through relaxation. </p>
<p>While it is possible to access the imagination without deep  relaxation, relaxation makes it more vivid and less prone to gremlin hijacks.  Breath work combined with envisioning a safe, special place in visual,  auditory, taste, olfactory and kinesthetic channels (see, hear, feel, taste,  smell) brings clients to their very rich, wise world. </p>
<p>Permissive, non-directive, open-ended questions open up the  possibilities for meaningful discoveries and learning. Phrases such as, &ldquo;What  are you aware of?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening now?&rdquo;  are great examples of coaching phrases that work well with the IGIsm  process. I notice that the more open and permissive the request, the more  likely it will yield &ldquo;exquisite awareness&rdquo; (to coin a phrase from the  Relationship Intelligence course).</p>
<p>Imagery practitioners first learn to guide clients with the  strategy to &ldquo;form an image.&rdquo; It is used to explore dreams, resistance, symptoms  or anything one wants to discover and learn more about. Once relaxed, the  client is guided to &ldquo;form an image&rdquo; for their, let&rsquo;s say, resistance. They  would describe it (for example, black, smoky, thick, etc.), and then look for  its qualities. Here the guide would use permissive, non-directive questions to  deepen the awareness. Images often come as movie or cartoon characters,  animals, creatures, historical or family figures and other symbols or  metaphors. </p>
<p>With IGIsm, the client interacts with the image.  S/he identifies feelings about the image and then is invited to communicate  those to the image, allowing the image to respond back in a way that they can  understand (&ldquo;Future Self&rdquo; has an interactive component). This interaction can  elicit profound insight.</p>
<p>From here, the client asks questions of the image and  typically unearths discoveries, often represented by symbols or metaphor. In  this example, s/he would ask the resistance what it wants/needs. With that  information, the client and image might come to some kind of understanding  about next steps.</p>
<p>So, coaches, when working with client vision, there may be  times to consider bypassing the conscious mind and taking the client a little  deeper. Let&rsquo;s take a deeper look at the specifics of this approach.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to invite clients to become aware of  their breathing, inviting it to become a little deeper. Deepen the relaxation  even more by visiting a beautiful, special, safe place of the <em>client&rsquo;s choice</em>, (don&rsquo;t impose your own  or suggest they fly out of earth&rsquo;s atmosphere&mdash;unless they&rsquo;ve chosen to go  there). Ask them what they see, feel, hear, smell (and taste) in this place,  along with what time of day/year/temperature. Here&rsquo;s a sample of the coach&rsquo;s  portion of dialogue from this point: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&ldquo;Form an image for this (resistance). What do you notice? Say more  about that. Anything else? What qualities do you notice? What feelings are you  aware of? Express these feelings to the image and let it respond to you in a  way that you understand. Let me know what it says. (Mirror back what the client  reports.) What questions do you have for the image? Ask it, and let me know how  it responds&hellip;(mirror). What would you like to express to the image? Go ahead, tell  it. How is that for you? Anything else?</em></p>
  <p><em>When you&rsquo;re ready, express your appreciation for the image coming today  and allow the image to fade, knowing that you will be bringing anything that  was useful or interesting back with you, including any feelings of comfort and  relaxation. Find yourself back in your special place. When you&rsquo;re ready, allow  the image of this beautiful place to fade, coming back fully to this place and  time. Move your hands and feet, and gently stretch and open your eyes.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the client has fully returned to the present, discuss what  was interesting, surprising and useful. Mine the wisdom, ground the learning,  generate inquiries, suggest structures, and embrace the power that this  visioning experience yields. </p>
