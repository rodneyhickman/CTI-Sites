<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center; margin-top:0;">Coaching as Ritual Transformation</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Have you ever noticed that when a coaching session is going particularly well, the Level 3 is singing in the air? What is that resonance, and how do we get to it? One of the ways we co-create the sparkling energy that can go deep and stay light at the same time is through ritual. How so?<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Ritual is alive in everything we do. Our lives are ritually enacted in our daily morning routines, in the ways in which we greet the New Year, in the turkey we eat at Thanksgiving, the ways we put our children to bed at night, and the toasts we clink at weddings and celebrations. The structures we&rsquo;ve incorporated into our lives impose order that molds and designs optimum outcomes from the vast, messy and marvelous experience of being alive.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">What is ritual in the coaching world? Coaching is all about creating rituals. Rituals are structures through which energy flows. Think Synergy. Remember the afternoon session in which the leaders promise a &ldquo;surprise?&rdquo; And the room is off limits until you&rsquo;re allowed back into a space that has been transformed into a theatre of sorts, in which a ritual begins&mdash;the dance of who we have become as CTI Co-Active coaches.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0;"> Transformation is the key. The German anthropologist&nbsp;Arnold van Gennep first defined what is known in ritual as liminal space, a phrase derived from the Latin word limen, meaning threshold. Liminal space is created when the threshold of consciousness is broken. It&rsquo;s the crack of light in the horizon between night and day,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the time of hypnogogic sleep&mdash;it&rsquo;s the space into&nbsp;which the contemplative enters in order to contact whatever it is that is imagined to be Spirit. It is the space of deep transformation. The agent of the ritual, often a shaman, or priest, is the one who&nbsp;knows the power of the space, but is empowered only to show the way, to create ritual ways for the rites of passage through which others&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;change in significant ways. Coaches, I dare to say, are modern shamans in this sense.<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Three years ago this month, I graduated from Synergy, with full to overflowing enthusiasm about the elegance and the power of the CTI training. Its rich level of stimulation (deepening the action) was stunningly well balanced by the structural design of the courses (furthering the action). While I wasn&rsquo;t yet 100 percent convinced I wanted to become a coach, I recognized that the coaching training up to that point had sharpened my counseling skills in a way I couldn&rsquo;t ignore. While it&rsquo;s taken me three years to return to the beginning, so to speak, I&rsquo;m&nbsp;grateful to be &ldquo;back in the saddle&rdquo; for the&nbsp; certification process. And ritual has everything to do with it.<br> 
  <br>
In the micro-ritual of individual coaching sessions that we witnessed as students, (think Process), one student (the initiate) is chosen by the leaders and undergoes an entire journey in front of the room. The choosing is one of the three stages of ritual growth: separation, liminality and aggregation. After the student agrees to enter into the coaching (separation), a process then occurs that is wholly in the present, in which previous or future ways of being are irrelevant and powerful questions shift levels of consciousness (liminality). Something new emerges: a new perspective, a new behavior, a new inner awareness. During the third stage, aggregation, he or she rejoins the group after the process is closed, and the task complete. It&rsquo;s a hero&rsquo;s journey, inclusive of dragon-slaying (think gremlins) and&nbsp;joining with transcendent power (your own Higher Self). Lessons are learned, values are deepened, and a piece of your life is integrated in a new way.<br> 
<br>
I was the initiate in my Process class. What happened to me couldn&rsquo;t have been more liminal and must have looked particularly weird to the rest of the group. In fact, I couldn&rsquo;t speak. I was so full of a bizarre kind of energy. In response to the leader&rsquo;s powerful questions,&nbsp;I ended up drawing a series of strange abstract pictures. In the end, I put my feet on one of the pictures as if I just arrived on earth for the first time, and I burst into tears. There was little verbal content to the ritual process I underwent, neither coach nor client &ldquo;knew&rdquo; in a linear way what was going on, but the Level 3 was singing and the room shook. Later on, I felt cleansed and cleared of some dark energy that wasn&rsquo;t even mine. A year passed before I came upon a painting I had made 20 years earlier about a painful situation in my mother&rsquo;s family of origin. It was a direct replica of the last drawing I had done in that Process coaching session. <br>
<br>
In a coaching session that lasted maybe 20 minutes and had little talking in it except for the coach&rsquo;s calm but deep insistence on &ldquo;holding me under the water,&rdquo; an entire ritual of cleansing had taken place. It was a kind of sacrament of baptism,&nbsp;in which there came to be &ldquo;outward and visible symbols&nbsp; of inward and spiritual grace&rdquo; as one liturgical phrase puts it. I continued to metabolize the process for many months afterwards. So now I welcome the structures of Certification, and the extension of the ritual journey. While I&rsquo;ve been coaching for two years now, it&rsquo;s time to deepen the learning some more, and further the action into a full-time practice. I am proud to be joining this community of ritual makers, who know how important structure is on multidimensional levels. In lighting a candle in my office at the beginning of a coaching day, I acknowledge that presence of light in the center of myself, my clients and the process itself. Light is just another name for energy, and we can make it bigger through focus, curiosity, love, discipline and courage. Light as energy creates resonance. Resonance sings.</p>
