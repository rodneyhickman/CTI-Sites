<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Four Principles of Spiritual Coaching</strong></h1>
<p><strong><em>Awakening your Divine Light &amp; the Spirit of Coaching</em></strong></p>
<p>Coaching is spirituality expressed. It is spirit imbuing and shaping our every word with its loving presence and divine wisdom in the moment of now. And it is offered to awaken the stirrings of your and your client&rsquo;s soul, to return home and feel the joy and peace of union with your Self. </p>
<p>I offer you four principles that have brought me to this truth and changed the foundation upon which I coach. The first three principles were realized at various points along my coaching journey, the fourth being uniquely gifted to me in a dream. They are yours to add depth and breadth to your coaching practice, giving you room to breathe and surrender your need to work at coaching and life. They are yours to be embodied, calling you to shine as the Powerful Being of Light you are, sharing your loving presence with your clients and our world!</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1:&nbsp; You are a Powerful Being of Light; your greatest gift is your loving presence.</strong></p>
<p>Simply <em>being with</em> your client is powerful coaching. Being with and holding them in silence, offering the still, loving embrace of your presence, is your greatest gift to them. This gentle invitation is felt unconsciously, calling your clients to fall into their hearts and awaken the Divine Being that awaits their answer. Trusting that powerful coaching begins before a word is spoken is a sign you are beginning to let go and own your power, your Light. Creating the space for your clients to awaken requires nothing less than your own awakening to the eternal Light that shines beneath your heart.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Principle 2:&nbsp; The Big Agenda is always spiritual awakening. All other agendas (those mentioned in the wheel of life) are gateways.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Spiritual awakening is our highest calling. How each person gets there is different, but life always presents the perfect circumstances to support this. Much like a personal development course, our lives are perfectly arranged with the necessary &ldquo;experiential exercises&rdquo; to bring about awakening in the now. Whether it is in relationships, work, family or money situations, we attract the perfect &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; or teachings to awaken our Self. The role of spiritual coach is to support the client to <em>notice</em> and <em>integrate</em> the teachings already being presented to them. Spiritual coaching is raising the bar in how you interrelate with God&rsquo;s creative arrangement sent to and co-designed by your client. The coach evolves from coaching the client&rsquo;s striving and searching, to consciously coaching their <em>unfolding, </em>blending with the nature and timing of their life events, and leveraging them for the sake of awakening in the now. Spiritual coaching blends with the knowing that ultimately there are only teachers playing many roles&mdash;presenting endless opportunities to awaken in God&rsquo;s grand stage of life. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Principle 3:&nbsp; Now is the moment of awakening.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">There is no other time, and there is no other place. Here and now is where attention needs to be focused for powerful coaching to occur. The magic of coaching lies in this recognition: That only <em>now</em> can awakening occur. Awakening cannot depend on some future event. When you consciously use your client&rsquo;s circumstances as the pointer for awakening in the now, then coaching is no longer about fixing what is out there, but rather awakening to the gift the circumstance offers in this very moment. Now is the time to see <em>through</em> the circumstances life brings to us, and only now is the time to receive their gifts. When you surrender to the now, watch how everything else seems to take care of itself!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Principle 4:&nbsp; There is only so much you can do to support your client; let the universe take care of the rest.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">After this principle came to me in a dream, my coaching immediately transformed. I stopped trying so hard and my clients began having awe-inspiring breakthroughs and insights. It was a quantum leap and my clients were awakening faster than ever. It was because I let go. I took my hands off the proverbial coaching steering wheel and just allowed my clients to be exactly where they were. They didn&rsquo;t need to be anywhere else. Not only did I not have to work so hard, but neither did they. I realized they didn&rsquo;t need to figure it all out now. It would all unfold in time. And there is a great ease and joy that comes when coaching from this place. It comes when you have faith in the perfect unfolding of your client&rsquo;s life and then coach from that place. But this can only happen when you have faith in your own unfolding. Can you feel the warmth in your body of being able to let go and just trust and allow the perfection that is now? Can you feel the surrender of trusting that everything else will be taken care of, if you just take care of the now? Here you both surrender, coach and client. Here is where everything then becomes possible. The universe takes care of the rest. </p>
<p><strong>The Four Principles of Spiritual Coaching</strong>, more than anything, offer you and your client permission to surrender to the joy and peace of Self, and a synchronistic life that unfolds in ways beyond your envisioning. They invite you to be a conscious collaborator with life&rsquo;s perfection, knowing that ultimately God is coach. And they allow you to feel and know that you are a powerful instrument of light, both in silence and word. In surrendering to and embodying these four principles, spaciousness is created, allowing you and your client to greet in sacred harmony, uniting your songs in a symphony more beautiful and joyous than either of you could have ever imagined. </p>
<p>I wish you all a wondrous journey home!</p>
