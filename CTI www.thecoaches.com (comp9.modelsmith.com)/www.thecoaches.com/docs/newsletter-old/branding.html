<h1 class="style1">  Branding: What Is It and Why Should I Care? </h1>
<p class="style6">It all starts with you. The Brand Called You, to be specific. </p>
<p class="style6">Wait, wait, I hear you cry. Slow down. What&rsquo;s a brand? Why should I have to care about all that corporate stuff when I&rsquo;m going to dedicate my life, or a portion of it, perhaps, to Co-Active coaching? </p>
<p class="style6">Okay. Fair point. Maybe think about it like this. Say the following words out loud and see what comes to mind, almost unconsciously, viscerally: </p>
<p class="style6"><em>Starbucks. Madonna. Apple. The Body Shop. Volvo</em>.</p>
<p class="style6">Say these names and a set of surprisingly consistent associations spring to mind: Volvo means Safety, Apple means Innovation, Madonna means Pushing the Limits Beyond the Merely Provocative. </p>
<p class="style6">In truth, what we&rsquo;re talking about is the power of a brand. And, more importantly, the power of <em>brand values</em>.</p>
<p class="style6">In my work as a corporate strategy consultant, I&rsquo;m often asked to do what the client calls &ldquo;a branding project.&rdquo; Usually, what he or she has in mind is a little noodling with the logo or a new look and feel for the corporate website. What I then do is ask them to rethink the definition of branding. Here&rsquo;s where we end up: </p>
<p class="style6"><em>A brand is a promise</em>. <em>It&rsquo;s what the consumer/user/client can expect from the brand on a consistent, unwavering, unconditional basis</em>. </p>
<p class="style6">Once the client starts thinking about branding in that way, we&rsquo;re on to a much more meaningful discussion than serif or sans serif fonts.</p>
<p class="style6">In some recent work I did with a group of fellow CTI-trained coaches on how to market ourselves and generate more business, I started with the idea of The Brand Called You. I asked each of my colleagues to write down on a piece of paper no more than five values they believe define the promise they bring to their coaching clients. In other words, what is their individual brand promise? </p>
<p class="style6">Now, you might think that everybody said the same thing. Not true! I think people were genuinely surprised by the degree of individuality in the brand values. For example, answers included:</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom:0;">Authentic</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Fearless</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Compassionate</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Humorous</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Rigorous</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Fun</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Fiercely intelligent</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Supportive</p>
<p class="style6">See how different they are? In truth, the brand values are as unique as the coaches claiming them. And that&rsquo;s great. For what we need to remember to bring to our marketing is our individuality and our uniqueness as coaches. </p>
<p class="style6">So, before even starting to think about marketing yourself&mdash;business name, business cards, website, brochure, whatever&mdash;really take the time to identify the values that make you who you are and define your brand&mdash;your promise&mdash;to your clients and potential clients. </p>
<p class="style6">Now here comes the fun part. Use your values to drive your marketing. Use your values to define your brand. They must be present in everything you say about and do within your practice. For example, one of my values is clarity. I&rsquo;m pretty nutty about making sure that whatever I&rsquo;m saying is not only authentic but also clear. I, therefore, write simply. I use a smattering of shorter and longer sentences, so as to keep the rhythm of the language. And I spell things out. I ask questions and answer them. </p>
<p class="style6">Whatever your values are, you must remember this rule: NEVER USE GOBBLEDYGOOK. </p>
<p class="style6">Gobbledygook means nonsense. It can be extended to mean certain types of &ldquo;-speak,&rdquo;&nbsp; e.g., corporate-speak. Or management-speak. Or coaching-speak. We know what it means to dance in the moment or to go down the tube. However, our potential clients, especially the corporate ones, will not only NOT know what those phrases mean, they will be turned off by them. Too California. Too American. Too tree-huggy and Kumbaya. </p>
<p class="style6">Okay, so supposing you already have a coaching practice and now you want to take it to the next level? That probably means you&rsquo;re ready to explore a new or additional market segment. For example, say you&rsquo;ve been working exclusively with private clients. Now you want to do some corporate work. How to get started? I am working with three coaches right now who are all trying to break into the corporate world. It seems overwhelming. Daunting, really. Especially if you don&rsquo;t come from a corporate background. </p>
<p class="style6">I have created something I call the 24-Hour Revolution. It&rsquo;s a one-on-one training course for coaches, adapted from some corporate work I do around team development strategies. In a nutshell, here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="style6" style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>Identify and articulate the value you bring to an organisation. In other words, why should Corporation X hire you? What are you offering? Remember to be really specific and to stay away from gobbledygook. </li>
  <li>Identify and articulate the success criteria. How will you and your clients both know you&rsquo;ve done what you said you would do? In corporate parlance, this is called the deliverable. </li>
  <li>Narrow your search.&nbsp; Be true to your values. Go after business because it&rsquo;s what you want to do. Pick an industry you&rsquo;re really curious about. Or choose one you know a lot about, etc. I do a lot of work with news organizations because that&rsquo;s what I know best. Now I&rsquo;m getting braver and pitching other industries. For example, I recently turned my personal obsession with Slow Food into a gig with a not-for-profit organization working to cure world hunger. </li>
  <li>Make contact. Okay, this is hard, I know it. But this is the time to be brave. Identify the right person in the organisation(s) and send a letter, an e-mail, a brochure, whatever. Communicate what it is you have to offer to that specific organisation. Be really clear about what&rsquo;s in it for the organisation. </li>
  <li>Follow-up. Supply testimonials or letters of reference. Always, always, always keep it relevant to the client you&rsquo;re trying to interest. </li>
</ol>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">If all this stuff seems simple, it&rsquo;s because it is. It doesn&rsquo;t take an MBA degree or a strategy consultant to figure this out for you. What it does take, however, is the realization that it begins and ends with The Brand Called You: your promise, your commitment. </p>
