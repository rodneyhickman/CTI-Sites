<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Blending Co-Activity with the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought</strong></h1>
<p>The Three Principles were first articulated 25 years ago by Sydney Banks and have been successfully applied in the United States in various education, community regeneration, rehabilitation and corporate environments. Since April 2004, Blue Balloon Foundation in the UK has been dedicated to introducing Principles-based understanding to a more global audience.</p>
<p>The Three Principles refer to the universal truths of mind, consciousness and thought, which operate inseparably in every second of our human experience. They explain the energetic interconnectedness of existence, the source of our health and well-being, the power of collective consciousness and our ability to create our reality through our thinking. These principles are the fundamental &ldquo;givens&rdquo; of humanity, clearly setting out the commonalities of human experience. Once we understand and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; these truths on an individual level, we are able to rediscover our inner resiliency and wisdom, and become deeply empowered and self-reliant.</p>
<p>This work is particularly powerful and effective in an educational setting, as it addresses the gap between children and adults. In their work with lecturers at a further education college in the UK, it was found that the participants reported a greater capacity for recognising the needs of individual students, and a calmer attitude and approach to classroom situations. This effortlessly elicited a different response in the students themselves. </p>
<p>As babies and young children, we operate at a high level of consciousness, meaning that our experience is grounded in the present moment. As we get older, we become accustomed to living in the past or in the future in our thought, which causes our level of consciousness to drop.&nbsp; The model for deepening our understanding of the Three Principles illustrates the quality of our thinking at different levels of consciousness and enables adults to recover the child-like, moment-to-moment experience of reality. This in turn heightens our innate, default sense of compassion and well-being. </p>
<p>There is considerable symbiosis and mutual benefit between the Three Principles&rsquo; model of understanding and that of Co-Active coaching. Whilst we as coaches take the stance that our clients are naturally creative, resourceful and whole, the Three Principles ground this stance in universal truth. So instead of having to keep reminding ourselves of the natural creativity and resourcefulness of our clients, we can just relax, be present, and wait for their innate wisdom to bob to the surface. </p>
<p>As coaches, we are familiar with helping our clients free themselves from gremlins and limiting habits of thought. The Three Principles of mind, consciousness and thought explain how those limiting habits and gremlins come about in the first place, which offers clients a very powerful and empowering insight into the role and impact of their own thinking. </p>
<p>One of the most playful and effective tools in the coaching kit is that of perspectives, with which we help clients &ldquo;try on&rdquo; new patterns of thinking and adopt new ways of getting into action to achieve a more desirable outcome for themselves. Implicit in perspectives work is the illusion of reality we choose to adopt in any moment. The Three Principles make explicit the illusory nature of thinking, and explain how each person will naturally create her or his own separate reality or perspective through thought. In this way, we can help our clients recognise and deepen their understanding of the illusion, resulting in an increased ability to catch themselves in habits that do not serve them and naturally choose an alternative course of action.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Three Principles practice also has much to gain from the Co-Active way of being. Connection, curiosity and deep listening are vital skills in facilitating others&rsquo; understanding of the Three Principles, and in fully appreciating another&rsquo;s reality and interpretation. These skills occupy a significant proportion of the curriculum for those training to become Principles facilitators.</p>
<p>Combining Co-Activity and Principles understanding within our coaching and facilitation practices lends us the new dimension of having knowledge and information to impart to our clients in service of helping them deepen their own understanding. Providing an explanation of levels of consciousness and what makes us think can significantly help those of our clients who are struggling with the <em>whys</em> and <em>hows</em> of their experience. We can also help our clients gain insight into their emotional responses, which are explained by the Three Principles as an early warning system indicating the present quality of our thinking or level of consciousness.</p>
<p>Mind, consciousness and thought operate together in every single moment, and, rather like the phenomenon of gravity, exist and influence our experience whether or not we understand, recognise or &ldquo;believe in&rdquo; them. There is tremendous mutual benefit in bringing together the Three Principles understanding with Co-Activity. This is a powerful step, not only for the evolution of the coaching profession, but also for the evolution of human consciousness.</p>
