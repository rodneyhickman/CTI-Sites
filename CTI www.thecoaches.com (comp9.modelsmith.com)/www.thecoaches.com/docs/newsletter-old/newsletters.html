<h1 class="style1">The DOs and DON&rsquo;Ts of Great Newsletter Marketing </h1>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">As a longtime producer of newsletters for coaches, therapists and consultants, I talk to a lot of solo professionals about their marketing needs and dilemmas. Some are newly in practice and wondering how the heck to get clients and drum up business. Others are old hands who want to take their business to a new level. I&rsquo;ve noticed some similar trends in all of these conversations: </span></p>
<ul class="style6">
  <li><span style="color:black;">Almost everyone has heard that it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a newsletter</span>. </li>
  <li>M<span style="color:black;">any are not clear on exactly why </span>newsletters are a good marketing tool <span style="color:black;">or how best to use them.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">Almost no one feels they have time to do a newsletter, and many just feel lost when it comes to creating one; consequently, most don&rsquo;t. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;"><span style="color:black;">I also spend time talking with my current newsletter clients, learning what they are doing and what works. Those having the most success with their newsletters are taking very specific steps. Some of these practices seem really basic, but it&rsquo;s surprising how many people miss them. Other practices are marvelously creative; I grin when I hear a new one! I&rsquo;d like to share some of what I&rsquo;ve learned from my clients in this list of &ldquo;DOs&rdquo; and &ldquo;DON&rsquo;Ts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DO send your newsletter to everyone you know.</span></strong><span style="color:black;"> I mean <em>everyone</em> (of course, abiding by all spam regulations). Immediate family members, friends, relatives, past business associates, church members, your men&rsquo;s or women&rsquo;s group, colleagues, your anthropology classmates, your child&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s parents&mdash;you get the picture! <em>Everyone</em>! </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Newsletters work because they increase your visibility by consistently keeping your name before your public, they position you as an expert and reinforce your credibility, they introduce you to new referral sources, and they remind people of your availability and willingness to help. You never know who&rsquo;s in need of your services at what time. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DON&rsquo;T miss the tremendous value of a hardcopy newsletter.</span></strong><span style="color:black;"> I know it goes against the standard industry advice right now, which is that ezines are the only way to go. I produce a variety of ezines for my clients, so I know they are a great tool and have a deservedly respected place in the world of marketing a coaching business. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">But there are so many wonderful things you can do with a hardcopy newsletter that you can&rsquo;t do with an electronic one. Hand them out immediately to new contacts and double the impact of your first impression. Bring your newsletter to workshops, classes, presentations, meetings, speeches&mdash;anything you do in person. Leave stacks of them in the offices of other professionals (with their permission, of course), including doctors, massage therapists, attorneys, financial advisors, chiropractors, etc. Other places may be open to stacking, as well. Try your local Chamber of Commerce, natural food store, bookstore, coffee shop, community center. (Here&rsquo;s a great tip: Wherever possible, place your stacks of newsletters in an upright clear literature stand.) </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Hardcopy newsletters also make great stuffers for press kits and/or a speaker&rsquo;s bio package. And they have a &ldquo;retro appeal&rdquo; that is rising as people get overloaded with email communications.</span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DO provide useful, educational content.</span></strong><span style="color:black;"> Yes, a newsletter is a promotional tool for you and, as such, it should contain information about you, your services and any upcoming events of interest. But just as important, a newsletter is a gift from you to the world. When you provide relevant, helpful content, you are saying: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I know and how I can help.&rdquo; You position yourself as an expert who cares and is available for that time when readers&mdash;or someone they know&mdash;will need your services. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Avoid writing too much about yourself. Some is OK, if it is essential to the point you&rsquo;re making. More important is to consider the issues people are dealing with&mdash;in marketing jargon, <em>their pain</em>. Write (or use purchased articles) that go to the heart of the things in life that cause people pain or discomfort in their personal or professional lives. Provide hope and inspiration and knowledge. We humans thirst for this. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DON&rsquo;T let your Gremlins get in the way! </span></strong><span style="color:black;">Newsletters will take care of &ldquo;putting you out there,&rdquo; but for some people, that&rsquo;s the problem! It&rsquo;s important to recognize the value and the worthiness of your message. Common Gremlin-based thoughts are: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to say,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really an expert,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No one wants to read anything I send out.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DO send your newsletter consistently and regularly. </span></strong><span style="color:black;">Devote at least one day a month to creating your newsletter. Schedule it in your planner. You may even need to leave your office to do it, to avoid getting pulled into something else. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Newsletters are all about building relationships, and as with any relationship, it&rsquo;s important for people to be able to count on you. Nurturing those relationships with your newsletter brings in repeat business with less marketing effort. When clients read the articles you consistently and regularly deliver, you stay in the forefront of their minds. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">I&rsquo;m often asked how often to send a newsletter. For some people and businesses, a weekly email communication is appropriate, but more often a monthly ezine is sufficient. Hardcopy newsletters can go out a little less often, usually every other month or quarterly. What seems to have the biggest impact is to send an ezine each month and a hardcopy newsletter two to six times a year.</span></p>
<p class="style6"><strong><span style="color:black;">DON&rsquo;T think you have to do everything yourself.</span></strong><span style="color:black;"> I invite you to think beyond the box: If doing a newsletter is a struggle for you, how else can you make it happen? If writing just isn&rsquo;t your cup of tea, or if you&rsquo;d rather not spend the time, how else can you have a newsletter and reap the benefits? </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Outsourcing your newsletter&mdash;or just parts of it&mdash;is one way to make sure it comes out regularly and doesn&rsquo;t get left on the back burner indefinitely. There are several custom newsletter providers who cater to the needs of coaches and consultants with very affordable services, my own company included. You can get anything from a single article to augment your own content all the way up to a full newsletter (ezine or hardcopy) personalized with your bio, services and upcoming event information. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">Another idea is to team up with a friend or several to share the effort or cost of producing a newsletter. Makes it more fun, too. Or trade coaching services with a writer, who can turn your spoken thoughts into a cohesive article. </span></p>
<p class="style6"><span style="color:black;">The bottom line: When used well, newsletters are an extremely effective (and cost-effective) way to market your practice. A little bit of intention is really all that&rsquo;s needed to get started. DO!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
