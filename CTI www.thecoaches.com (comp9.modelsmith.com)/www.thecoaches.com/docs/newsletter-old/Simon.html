<h1><strong>Conflict, Emotional  Hijacking &amp; Healing in Couples Work</strong></h1>
<p>Our clients come to us for coaching because they want the  assistance of a professional who can help them achieve some change or growth  that they have been unable to accomplish on their own. In the course of working  together, our job is bring the clients&rsquo; attention to the place(s) where they  get stuck, help them recognize and understand what is getting in their way and  support them to design effective strategies to work around them. </p>
<p>In my work with couples, I find that one of the central  places that people repeatedly get stuck in their dance together usually has at  least one&mdash;if not both&mdash;partners caught in the grip of an emotional hijacking.  Emotional hijacking, also described as &quot;being triggered,&quot; describes a  distressing experience when an internal switch flips and, in an instant, a  person is no longer in control of his/her emotional response to the other  person. In this state, authentic communication is no longer possible. The  couple spins out into an emotionally charged interchange that ends with one or  the other partner simply ending the conversation by walking away or shutting  down, with no real resolution to the underlying issue. </p>
<p>Recognize this from couples you have worked with? If so,  does this sound familiar? A person describes his or her experience as: </p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; The feeling  overcomes him in a flash. <br />
  &bull;&nbsp; She either lashes  out or shuts down. <br />
  &bull;&nbsp; Once the emotions  start, the experience has a life of its own. <br />
  &bull;&nbsp; The only thing he  can do is wait until it passes, which can takes hours&mdash;or longer&mdash;to complete. <br />
  &bull;&nbsp; She often feels  remorse afterward for her behavior or things she said. <br />
  &bull;&nbsp; He believes this is  part of who he is and the other person must change for both of them to be OK. </p>
<p>The good news is, as coaches, we can help people to  transform these outbursts. To begin with, when emotionally hijacked, people  will have body sensations, emotions, stories and behavioral responses that are  consistent whenever they are triggered. In the first instance, there will  always be a physical sensation&mdash;sometimes subtle&mdash;that is a warning sign that  their switch is about to flip, which is followed by emotions and feelings of  frustration, disappointment, anger, disbelief, etc. The way people often make sense  of this intense experience, which happens in a nanosecond, is to believe that  the other person is doing something to create it. Based on that belief, they  will either attack or withdraw. </p>
<p>In fact, what people who are triggered are experiencing is  the rush of adrenaline coursing through their nervous system. If the couple can  identify that the person is triggered, the best thing to do is to have the  person, as quickly as possible, leave the situation believed to be causing distress.  Once alone, the person can watch his/her physical sensations arise and name  them as they do. For example: &quot;I've got an intense tightness in my  shoulders. It's moving down my arms. I feel warm. My head is a little tight  near my temples.&rdquo; This creates a distance for the person to both have the  sensations and witness them. The person can also watch and name the emotions he  or she is feeling as they build up and then resolve. For example: &quot;I'm  really frustrated. I feel really angry. I feel disrespected. I feel hurt. I  feel sad. I feel invisible.&rdquo; You can do this with clients in real time if they  begin to get triggered during a session. </p>
<p>By bringing awareness to these reactions, without attaching  any story to them&mdash;just being with the pure experience of the sensations&mdash;the  experience will naturally begin to resolve itself, often quite quickly. People  are then able to see that their response was not attached to their partner's  words or behaviors, but rather was a completely internal experience. Once returned  to a calm state, people are able to access their inner resources and work with  their partner to address the issue that needs to be discussed. </p>
<p>When clients are unable to shift the intensity and/or  duration of these experiences, I refer them to work with a practitioner of  Somatic Experiencing, on which this approach is partly based. </p>
<p>By working with clients in this way, a spaciousness opens up  for them so that they can listen to the stories that arise when they are  triggered and discover what the fears and unmet needs are that lie beneath the  hijacked response. <em>When people are able to witness their own  process in this way, they can begin working with their partner to shift from a  state of fear to one of love; they are now available to the coaching process  and able to participate more fully with their partner in designing the  relationship they want.</em> With these new insights and some skill-building,  we can help couples undo the negative emotional programming that is at the  heart of so much conflict, and create loving ways to foster safety and ease to  replace what were once seemingly insolvable conflicts. </p>
<p>This approach draws on a number of practices: Peter Levine's  work on trauma and Somatic Experiencing; Buddhist practices of awareness and  the cultivation of compassion; new science, which teaches that the mere act of  observing something changes that which is being observed and still has that  same impact, even when the observer and observed are the same person; and  cognitive work with stories. </p>
