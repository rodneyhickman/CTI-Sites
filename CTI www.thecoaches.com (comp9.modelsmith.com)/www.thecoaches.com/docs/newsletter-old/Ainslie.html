<h1>CTI Staff Profile&mdash;Barb Ainslie</h1>
<p><img width="189" height="176" src="Ainslie_clip_image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" />Barb Ainslie, our &ldquo;Certification Maven&rdquo; here at CTI, was born in Seattle, WA, though she spent most of her time growing up in Grand Rapids, MI. She only recently made her way out to California, and has now landed  at The Coaches Training Institute. We&rsquo;re glad she did! This office just would  not be the same without Barb&rsquo;s unique blend of irreverence, wit and her unique  ability to &ldquo;call it like it is&rdquo; and get away with it. (This is probably due to  her genuinely warm eyes and whole-hearted smile.)</p>
<p>Barb was led out to  California, and ultimately to CTI, through her longtime friend and current  housemate Gail Barrie. She remembers walking into the CTI offices on a visit  and thought to herself, &ldquo;I could work here.&rdquo; Four months later, she moved out  to California and found herself working at CTI. Talk about sourcing! She made  the trek here via an interesting mix of jobs that have well prepared her for  what she&rsquo;s doing now. Barb spent 13 years in customer service at a leading  insurance company. Most recently, she owned an upholstery and antique store,  working simultaneously as a Crime Prevention Organizer for the City of Grand Rapids. Barb&rsquo;s been around the block,  grabbing diverse expertise along the way.</p>
<p>As certification  specialist, Barb schedules all the exams, assigns people to their certification  pods and collects all associated paperwork, among other things. She has  constant deadlines to meet, but her favorite part of the job is connecting with  people from all over the world. Her favorite parts about working at CTI are  both the people who gravitate here and the unique environment of this place.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an organization where people actually &lsquo;walk their talk,&rsquo; which is very  refreshing,&rdquo; she says. Regarding her Myers-Briggs type and how this affects her  work personae she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a NATO, which stands for Not About Typing, <em>Obviously</em>. Mostly this answer just  confuses people who try to put other people in boxes, based on some letters in  the alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The biggest &ldquo;aha&rdquo;  Barb has had since she started working at CTI is even knowing what an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; is.  She discovered this one day when she was at Level 3 and someone (who was at  Level 1) was talking to her. She thought, while dancing in the moment, &ldquo;Well,  this person is naturally creative, resourceful and whole,&rdquo; so she dropped into  her bones, experienced her process and then shifted perspective by inquiring  about that person&rsquo;s future self, bringing the whole conversation back around to  a place of fulfillment. (You&rsquo;ve just had a taste of Barb&rsquo;s irreverence!)</p>
<p>Barb says that  though skydiving and bungee jumping still continue to elude her, the thing she  is masterful at is organizing events. (It&rsquo;s a little known fact that Barb was  also a community organizer in another life and pulled off some pretty big events  back in the day). Co-Activity is a perfect fit for Barb, as she values good  communication and being aware of one&rsquo;s impact. She aims to be as Co-Active as  she can, both on the job and in life. And on a final note, when asked what  she&rsquo;d like us to know that we&rsquo;ve not yet covered Barb said, &ldquo;I love power tools  and I know how to use them!&rdquo;</p>
