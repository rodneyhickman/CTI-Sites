<h1> Co-Activity and the Magnificence of Inspired Creation</h1>
<p>Elizabeth, Ann-Michelle and I (Paige) were sitting knee-to-knee in a circle in a small cabin in the Colorado Rockies. We had come with our intentions for the weekend: to fully envision our year-long program for women that would have them find their unique strength as women by learning to circle, collaborate and create with other women, and, finally, to find and express their true calling. These were the outcomes we wanted to achieve with the vision for our program, the Wise Woman Journey. We wanted to create the specific schedules and activities for the retreats, a brochure and content for a website, and create action plans that had the three of us working in alignment with each other. Ambitious for two-and-a-half days to be sure! What we had going in our favor was a deep trust that we were being shown an old/new way to create. And we knew that with our rooting in Co-Activity, we would create exactly what we wanted.</p>
<p>So, we designed our alliance, discussing how we wanted to work together and how we wanted to be when we got stuck, in hopes of immediately empowering our intuition to guide us. During that year, my two closest friends/colleagues and I created the program called the Wise Woman Journey. In so doing, we have come to know the miracle of inspired creation.</p>
<p>What is inspired creation? It is an experience in which an individual or group of people feel called to create something from a dream or a vision. Central to inspired creation is a belief that it will contribute to the lives of others, and make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that we&rsquo;ve learned about how to lay the foundation for inspired creation:</p>
<p><b>&middot; Vision precedes action.</b> Inspired creation is primarily a receptive process. It demands of us that we first create space, listen for guidance and trust what we receive. Once this has been attended to, action taken will be full of ease, flow and synchronicity. </p>
<p>We have learned&mdash;often the hard way&mdash;to ensure that we start with a clear vision for what we are intending to create. Now, the next step is to create a &ldquo;mock-up.&rdquo; We do this by taking time to envision the smaller particles, such as our ideal venue, the perfect participants and other important aspects of the program. We start to give it detail and even a name. Only then do we take action.</p>
<p><b>&middot; Follow the &ldquo;YES.&rdquo;</b> Inspired creation is an organic process. Once initiated, it takes on a life of its own, and will lead us if we are willing to follow. And what do you follow? Follow the &ldquo;YES!&rdquo; </p>
<p>When you begin to take your creation out into the world, you will get clear indications of what to do and develop next simply by going where there is no resistance. When things become hard and are taking too much energy to accomplish, we have to be willing to let go of our expectations that things will proceed in a certain way.</p>
<p>When we first launched Women Circling the Earth, we were having difficulty enrolling women into the year-long program. Women were telling us that the dates of the retreats didn&rsquo;t work for them, and that we weren&rsquo;t allowing enough lead time before the start of the program. We let go of our &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; to keeping the dates we&rsquo;d set, changed them, and soon women were signing up with ease.</p>
<p><b>&middot; Keep the creation space clear.</b> Like any relationship, the relationship between you and your creation needs care and tending from time to time. The space can become clouded, confused, neglected or overcrowded with expectations, and needs to be de-cluttered and cleaned regularly.</p>
<p>The most integral component of clearing the space is complete personal honesty about what you are experiencing as you create. This may range from total joy to total frustration. Joy (or lack thereof) can be used as a barometer of how clear your creation space is, or whether it is time to do some cleaning. If your creation is a collaborative project, this will entail some deep truth-telling with the others you are working with. It&rsquo;s also a great time for leaning in to curiosity, listening deeply and self-management! </p>
<p><b>&middot; Be prepared to experience profound personal growth</b>. One of the outcomes of inspired creation is personal transformation. If you want to engage in this process, be ready to learn a lot about yourself. </p>
<p>Throughout the development of Women Circling the Earth, all three of us have observed that the creation is taking place on multiple levels. The visible, tangible, external creation includes program details, marketing materials, participants attracted to the program and multiple other &ldquo;results.&rdquo; On another level, there exist the deeper reasons we were led to create the program and why women are attracted to participate in it. And weaving throughout are the insights we have gained individually about our own personal styles, strengths and areas for healing or development. One clear sign for me that this is an inspired creation is that I am constantly motivated to grow into the best of myself. <br>
</p>
<p>What are the benefits of working with the inspired creation process? As an individual, you will experience the spaciousness and joy of inspired creation. Though it may feel like you are investing more time up front in the process to do a mock-up or clear space, it ultimately results in such ease that more time is available for what is most important to you. </p>
<p>The process itself honors all those who are touched by it. It takes care of both results and the people involved in the creation. </p>
<p>Most importantly, this process guarantees that the creation is truly needed in the universe. Since the creation comes through you, rather than from you, ego is put aside: you do not create because you think it is a good idea, that it will make you successful, or earn lots of money (though these may also be true). You create because you are called to create. </p>
<p>Inspired creation is applicable in all areas of your life, from business, to art, to relationships and family. This ancient process is being reborn as the new way to create. Hear the call and enter upon the most thrilling adventure of your life.<br>
