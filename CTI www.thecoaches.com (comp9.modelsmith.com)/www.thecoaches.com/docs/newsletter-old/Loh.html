<h1 align="left"><strong>Letting Go Is  Not Failure</strong></h1>
<p>Change is inevitable. Nothing remains the same, like it or  not, acknowledge it or not. Even when we think something is still the same, it  has already changed. Life evolves. Relationships evolve and it&rsquo;s a process.  Relationship coaching is about revealing the relationship (system) to itself by  bringing exquisite awareness to its process as it unfolds. </p>
<p>I generally coach three kinds of relationships: the  relationship that exists between two people (intimate or otherwise), within music  ensembles, and the relationship between creative artists and their medium of  expression (such as musician to music or musician to instrument).</p>
<p>My client is the relationship or the third entity, as we  call it. I sense this as a living, breathing organism with a life of its own.  This relationship entity is dynamic and energetic. It wants to grow and we  can&rsquo;t predict precisely how it will do so, not to mention control or dictate  its process. So, we apprentice ourselves to the mastery of dancing with change,  by being as conscious and curious as we can be. </p>
<p>At the inception of relationship, there is an initial spark  (sentient essence), and a dream begins to unfold which then finds form in  consensus reality, the reality that we can all agree upon as true. Think of an  acorn. It holds the essence of the mighty oak tree: its perfect potential, as  well as its eventual death. In a sense, the acorn dreams itself a tree before  the tree is known by us. The tree wants only to grow and will persevere against  all odds. It will respond well to the nurturance of rain, sun and soil, and  there is no way of knowing with certainty what circumstances will influence its  growth or the form it will take over time. Along the way, it will litter the  ground beneath it with twigs and branches of all sizes. The tree lets go of  branches that have become too heavy, unessential or diseased so that it may  continue to grow. If the tree holds onto its burden too long, it may split  right down the center of its trunk, whether by sheer weight alone or the force  of wind.</p>
<p>The winds that come to <em>us</em> in our relationships are the winds of change, though sometimes they are only  breaths, whispers and sighs. We are too often more afraid of what it means to  change than we are afraid (or even aware) of the struggle and energy we burn up  resisting it. We are afraid of what the relationship will look like in its new  form.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself coaching relationships that are wanting to  let go, sometimes of old dreams or old identities, sometimes of each other.  Together, we become the observers of their process, and dance together in the  space of incredible awareness and magical curiosity at the marvel of how the  relationship wants to unfold. The dance runs from painful to delightful, and  the tempo changes from week to week. In the beginning of our sessions, so much  education in the concept of relationship as a third entity is required that the  challenge, for me, is to nimbly juggle explanation, discovery and action.  Clients want action, especially if they are in pain. They want to know they can <em>do</em> something. I begin by giving them  something they can <em>do</em> daily to  increase positivity, by focusing on gratitude, appreciation and designed  alliances.</p>
<p>If I bow to the clients&rsquo; desire to go to immediate action  and skip the education and essential awareness training, we will never have the  foundation upon which good relationship coaching is built. For me, it all  begins with awareness. As David Wagoner says in his poem &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;: </p>
<p><em>Stand still. The trees  ahead and bushes beside you</em><br />
    <em>Are not lost. Wherever  you are is called Here,</em><br />
    <em>And you must treat it  as a powerful stranger,</em><br />
    <em>Must ask permission to  know it and be known.</em></p>
<p>Maybe it is all our <em>doing</em> that has created our blindness to the splitting of the trunk in its early  stages. We are so busy doing that we do not stand still. We do not notice what  no longer serves our relationship and the burdens we are unnecessarily  carrying. We may not survive the winter storms, because we have not attended to  letting go. To let go is to say &ldquo;goodbye,&rdquo; and we are not comfortable with  that. There is a way in which we can, and must, honor that which we are  releasing, and the value, joy and love it once brought us. In so doing, we  honor each other and ourselves. We create a clean space for that which comes  next. </p>
<p>Letting go is not failing. Failing to let go can be deadly.  Whether it is with relationships, dreams, old identities or old ways of being  and doing things&mdash;these will need to be released so that new ones have room to  flourish. Our own personal dreams may need to be morphed in order for the  relationship dream to have room to grow. We might assume we need to let go of  each other, when it may be that we need to let go of some aspect of ourselves:  our personal and inflexible agendas. How willing are we to be changed by our  relationships?<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  This is the uncharted territory that I explore with my  clients in our coaching sessions. We &ldquo;stand still, be Here,&rdquo; and discover what  it is the relationship is expressing and how it wants to unfold. I do not  assume that I know what is best for them. As we are fond of saying, &ldquo;Who knows what  is good and what is bad?&rdquo; Still, when a couple decides to separate, my heart  aches. Goodbyes always make me cry. If I have an agenda, it is that my clients  become aware of and highly attuned to the third entity known as their  relationship, that they develop and exercise their muscles of curiosity and  presence to more skillfully and gracefully dance with inevitable change, and  that they come to know that they are the creators, not the creations, of their  reality.</p>
