<h1> First Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals Course in Health Care in Canada</h1>
<p>When I completed the Leadership program in 2000, I was clear that my &#8220;job&#8221; 
  in the world was to bring co-active coaching and leadership to the world of 
  health care. At the time, I figured this should be an easy sell. After all, 
  I was a trained coach and nurse with a quarter century of health care administrative 
  experience under my belt. And it made so much sense to me that co-active coaching 
  and leadership were what was missing in health care. However, not everyone was 
  in agreement at first.<br>
  <br>
  I began giving short workshops and coaching leaders and managers in the health 
  care system here in Vancouver. One thing slowly led to another, and I was included 
  as part of the training for an in-house leadership program at Providence Health 
  Care last year. This included a day&#8217;s worth of training leaders in coaching 
  skills and follow-up coaching with participants in triads over three months 
  to sustain their learning and keep them on the leadership track. As a next step, 
  I suggested the Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals course for their leaders, with 
  a hope that they would want the full curriculum and certification. <br>
  <br>
  On June 22, my dream came true. After two cancellations, and lots of hiccups, 
  I co-led the workshop with Deborah Colman, a veteran corporate coaching workshops 
  leader. The participants included heads of departments (social work, lab, IV 
  therapy, HR), the physician leader of the geriatric program, several organizational 
  development staff, labour relations and education specialists. <br>
  <br>
  There were many magical moments as these hospital leaders began to grasp both 
  the power of co-activity and our model. On the third day, one of the leaders 
  had to leave briefly to go to a budget meeting where she was sure she was going 
  to lose all but $10K of her budget to cuts. She showed up in her &quot;being&quot; 
  nametag (Warrior Princess), and not only kept her $10K, but got a total of $100,000 
  for her program. She came back to the workshop walking on air, completely convinced 
  that her confidence and coaching skills from the course had made the difference. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Now more than ever I am convinced that the power of co-activity is exactly what's 
  needed in the realm of health care. I KNOW that these skills&#8212;combined 
  with the shift in culture that comes from holding people naturally creative, 
  resourceful and whole&#8212;will provide the critical change that's so necessary 
  in the health care system and, more importantly, in the quality of care for 
  patients and their families.<br>
