<p><strong><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0601/debra.jpg" width="110" height="162" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></strong>Debra Martin, one of our lovely admissions advisors here at CTI, was born on August 28, 1953, in Oakland (which would make her 52 years old, but who&rsquo;s counting!). She&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s child&mdash;loving and giving,&rdquo; and anyone who knows Debra knows this is absolutely true! The hospital that she was born at happened to be across the street from Montgomery Wards. Her father used to joke and say that they ordered her from the catalogue, but he would follow that up with &ldquo;and we got exactly what we wanted.&rdquo; Awww.</p>
<p>Long before Debra came to join us at CTI in 2004, her first job was as a waitress at Don Pepe&rsquo;s restaurant in Livermore. The restaurant was right down the corner from a bar, so at 2 a.m., the bar crowd would show up for breakfast&mdash;which was Debra&rsquo;s first experience of customer service. She says she learned a lot there about working with the public and how to handle just about anyone! In between working as a waitress and working at CTI, Debra went to school, became one of the first Registered Dental Assistants in the state of California and then worked at the same wonderful office for 25 years. Debra says she found out about her current job at CTI from an announcement that went out to the CTI community. She was in a six-month coaching relationship with Phil Sandahl (who happens to have an article in this month&rsquo;s <em>Inquiry</em>, coincidentally) and was working on making a big life change. She was preparing to move to San Luis Obispo, but life handed her a surprise that year. Two days before Thanksgiving of 2003, Debra had a heart attack. It became clear to her over the next few months that she needed to be near her family support system. She had previously seen the job ad for the CTI position and managed to get her application in on the last day.</p>
<p>Debra has been an admissions advisor ever since. She is often the first person that a student will talk to about what coaching at CTI has to offer. She also answers questions from students who are currently enrolled. Good thing she got that early training with the 2 a.m. bar crowd! (Just kidding&mdash;or not, you decide.) Actually, in truth, what Debra likes best about her job is connecting with people. She says, &ldquo;Everyday I get to talk to people about their plans and dreams and what&rsquo;s most important to them. Then, over time, I get to witness them blossom. It&rsquo;s certainly a lot like coaching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debra is an INFP on the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator &reg; (you can also read more about this assessment in this month&rsquo;s <em>Inquiry</em>), which can also be called The Healer type. It makes perfect sense, therefore, that Debra is also a birth doula, which is a person who supports the mother/partner during labor and birth . Most folks are surprised to find out that she is not an E (extrovert), especially for the kind of work that she does. But it&rsquo;s true. Debra says she needs plenty of alone time to recharge. Her favorite things about working at CTI are sitting across from Andrew Gabel and making faces at him, connecting with all the wonderful people on staff, and knowing that collectively, we are all making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>To celebrate an accomplishment while working, Debra loves to &ldquo;bounce the bee!&rdquo; What that means for those of you who are not currently in the office with us, is that we all have miniature bouncy ball animals that are really fun to throw at the ground and see how high we can bounce them. Debra likes to try and hit the ceiling tiles on the rebound. This is an office where you can stand up and announce your latest accomplishment and everyone will applaud and cheer&mdash;FUN!</p>
<p>The biggest aha, or discovery, that Debra has made since she&rsquo;s worked at CTI is that she already has everything she needs. She also knows that nobody is better than her when it comes to making homemade cookies for the CTI staff, but she still has some learning to do around Excel spreadsheets. She adds that, &ldquo;Co-Activity shows up in my life and work by truly holding others as naturally creative, resourceful and whole, along with being curious. Curiosity always opens doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>If you could coach anyone in the world (living or dead), who would you coach and why?</strong></p>
<p>Laura Whitworth. I&rsquo;ve only met her once, but her impact was lasting. I admire her tenacity and her inquisitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite food/recipe? What food do you despise? </strong></p>
<p>My favorite food of the moment is a cheese enchilada at Mexico Lindo in Pleasanton. I despise tapioca pudding&mdash;why would you purposely put lumps in something?</p>
<p><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t know that I&hellip;</strong> am an accomplished accompanist and have played in the National Cathedral of Lithuania on the country&rsquo;s 500 th anniversary celebration.</p>
<p><strong>What are you often times found doing at 4 p.m. on any given Saturday afternoon? </strong></p>
<p>At 4 in the afternoon on any given Saturday, I am often putzing around the house, watching something on HGTV and doing some needlework.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most glorious moment/accomplishment of your life? </strong></p>
<p>The most glorious accomplishment(s) of my life are my three adult sons&mdash;young men that I am proud of and would want to know, even if they weren&rsquo;t mine.</p>
<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s your hero? </strong></p>
<p>My dad is my hero. He&rsquo;s been gone for 10 years now and I still miss him so much. He was bigger than life and hugely generous. He really saw the nugget of good in everyone he met. And, he was so funny!</p>
<p><strong>Where is your favorite place to play? </strong></p>
<p>My favorite place to play is near the ocean. I love the smells and the sounds of the sea.</p>
<p><strong>What would we find at your desk? </strong></p>
<p>At my desk you would find pictures of my boys and grandchildren, a picture of my leadership tribe, and a plaque that says: &ldquo;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&rdquo;</p>
