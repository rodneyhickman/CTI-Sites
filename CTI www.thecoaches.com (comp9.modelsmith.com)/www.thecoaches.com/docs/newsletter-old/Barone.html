<h1><strong>Challenges and  Triumphs in Credentialing: My Rocky Road (Not the Ice Cream Variety)</strong></h1>
<p>My desire to be a coach and to be credentialed were born  simultaneously, but the road that took me to the land of credentials was  anything but straight and narrow. In 2000, after losing more than 70 lbs., I  started my own business as a weight management consultant and personal trainer.  When I first heard about life coaching, I thought, &ldquo;Something that works  between the ears! My clients could use that!&rdquo; It was all about client success  to me; I wanted to help other people achieve permanent weight loss, too. I  attended a seminar with coaching pioneer Cheryl Richardson. Her advice? &ldquo;If you  are going to be a coach and a serious business owner, be a professional and get  credentialed.&rdquo; So, I went looking for a training program that was accredited by  ICF because I planned on being a PCC some day. </p>
<p>I heard people talking with great excitement about CTI at an  ICF conference, but I picked it for my training for the simple reason that the  training is done <strong><em>in person</em></strong>. I love phone seminars but, for deep learning, I  prefer a physical and kinesthetic experience. And though I made my decision on  a relatively simple turning point, I&rsquo;ve never regretted it. My gut wasn&rsquo;t lying  to me (does it ever?). I loved the way my core curriculum courses took me  deeper into knowledge, skills and my own self-development. </p>
<p>I mentioned that the road was a little rocky. Shortly after  completing my <strong><em>CCC</em></strong> course, I learned my husband (who had been  activated from the Air Force Reserves into the U.S. Air Force on 9/11) would be  deployed to the Mideast in the Enduring Freedom Campaign. My new business was  still part-time and it was my only employment. My husband&rsquo;s activation took him  from a civilian job to military service at a loss of 53% of his salary. Ouch! </p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 100">Trouble loomed on the horizon. <br />
  Sharp curve in the road!</p>
<p>I was determined not to abandon my dream of running my own  life and being a successful coach. I found a full-time job that allowed me to  work evening and weekend hours so I could run my business during the day. I  assembled elaborate babysitting schedules for my 8-year-old son. Then, I  squeezed in the <strong><em>Fulfillment</em></strong> course before my husband left the  U.S. Looking back, I know that it was my dream of autonomy and success that led  me through the rockiest times.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  That first deployment plunged me into a situation that  seemed surreal: My husband in harm's way; a son who was scared of war and very  needy; a home and yard to care for by myself; my own health (I refused to  regain ANY of the weight I had lost); a part-time business I loved; and a  full-time job that meant long hours away from my son who meant so much to me. </p>
<p>In addition, <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> training loomed out  there, beckoning me! </p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 100">It was almost a year between my <br />
    <strong><em>Fulfillment</em></strong> and my <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> course! <br />
  That felt like the longest year  of my <br />
  life, for so many reasons.</p>
<p>But, I was more committed to my dream than I was to reality.  If you are more committed to reality, everything looks like a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t  like NOs!</p>
<p>When my husband returned home, I got a spot in the next <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> course I could find. I even squeezed in <strong><em>Process</em></strong> before he had to  deploy again. He was very supportive of my training. The time I spent on my own  development was a treasure found right there on the rocky road. That treasure  quickly turned into abundance.</p>
<p>The perfect spot for <strong><em>Synergy</em></strong> appeared  when a friend offered me a little downtime at her home in L.A. All the while,  through several cancellations, CTI was fantastic about letting me work my courses  into my hectic, often unpredictable life. </p>
<p>Since I trained with a new group for each of my courses, I  knew a lot of CTI trainees. I heard great stories about certification from  them, but I vowed I&rsquo;d take that step only when my business could support me and  pay for certification as well. I was tiring of the two-job routine.</p>
<p>When my husband retired from the military, I was off to  build my business. I had fluctuated between two and five clients while  traveling my steep and rocky road. Now, I hired a fabulous coach (Ron Renaud,  CPCC, PCC) and I had my eye on &quot;CPCC.&quot;</p>
<p>Certification! What an amazing immersion into the things I&rsquo;d  already learned but at deeper levels. By the time I got there, I had more  confidence, a more thorough understanding of the principles and concepts of  Co-Active coaching, and a real desire to get on with my life. Passing my exam  was the real rite of passage for me. It took me to the most hellish place on  earth&mdash;being judged worthy (or not) by people who do not know me&mdash;truly one of  the most uncomfortable moments in my life. </p>
<p>I was touched by the grace and humanity my examiners (Keri  Kuerbis, Mai Vu, Milne Kintner) showed me. When I received my CPCC letter, what  had seemed like an ultimate achievement had transformed into yet another beginning.  I found myself looking forward. Some day, I hoped to coach with the wisdom and  love they showed me that day.</p>
<p>The long road to certification turned out to be an abundant  one in another way. Shortly after getting my CPCC, I had the required hours for  my ICF PCC credential, as well. </p>
<p>My belief in the professionalization of coaching has only  grown with my experience. I&rsquo;ve represented Wisconsin on ICF&rsquo;s national  regulatory committee for the past two years and also serve as my local ICF  chapter president.</p>
<p>I know that, as coaching thrives and grows, consistent  standards must be met. As someone who has a value of excellence, I want to be  the best coach I can be. </p>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 100">Looking back, I'm really proud <br />
  of my crooked, rocky road. It <br />
  says a lot about me. </p>
<p>ICF set the standards high, but CTI made the learning easy.  Finally, I have my full-time, thriving business. I have my autonomy. I have my  wonderful family in tact. I've got determination, grit and experience in my  tool chest. And I have my credentials, which tell the world just how serious I  am about professional coaching. </p>
<p>But, it's more than just that.</p>
<p>Although I know someone viewing &quot;CPCC&quot; and  &quot;PCC&quot; has no idea what I went through to attain those seven letters,  I do! They are a reminder to me that, when I am focused and committed, nothing  gets in my way!</p>
