<h1 style="margin-top: 0;">How to Assess the Assessments</h1>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;">An assessment can be a potent tool revealing brilliant information for the coach and client&mdash;a great asset in giving direction to the coaching; it can also be a dud. There are four basic questions to ask yourself that will help ensure the tool is useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Question 1. What is your objective?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">An assessment serves one of two functions&mdash;in rare cases, both: discovery or benchmarking. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Personality assessment aptitude and interest inventories give coach and client self-discovery information: strengths, preferences, tendencies. The MBTI&reg;, DiSC&reg;, StrengthFinders from Marcus Buckingham&rsquo;s groundbreaking book, <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em>, MAPP, Strong Interest Inventory, Kolbe, are all examples. For coaches working with individuals, these assessments give you and your client insight into how this person is wired, especially what strengths to lean into and situations or relationships that have a higher probability of success. They paint a portrait. </p>
<p>Some individual assessments are designed primarily to benchmark. In this category I would put most 360 instruments&mdash;and there are dozens on the market. Primarily used by corporate coaches, the 360 provides feedback about the subject from co-workers, supervisors and direct-reports. Inevitably, there will be learning and discovery from the process, but the objective is to establish a base line for the sake of designing on-going coaching. The LVI 360, created by CTI coach Kristie Bavaro, MBA, is a whole life approach; in addition to work relationships, she includes family and friends, as well, which enriches the discovery.</p>
<p>More and more, coaches are interested in working with teams, and there are a number of assessments available. Belbin Team Roles may be the most widely used, although there are Emotional Intelligence for Teams assessments and MBTI versions, as well. These are very useful for discovery of the individual team members, similar to the other personality assessments; they give the coach and team more information about the individuals and how the relationships work. However, for coaches who are familiar with CTI&rsquo;s Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching model, these assessments do not address the system that is the team. A team is more than the collection of the individual parts; it is a living, dynamic entity. The Team Diagnostic assessment does assess the team as a system. It is built on the ORSC model and actually fulfills both objectives: discovery and benchmarking. (Full disclosure: I am a founder, with Alexis Phillips, of Team Diagnostic International. For more information about this approach please look for the article in this <em>Inquiry</em>, &ldquo;Assess the Team as a System.&rdquo;)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Question 2: What does the assessment reveal? A corollary question for you as a coach would be, how is that useful?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Every assessment is built on a model. If you are an ENFP, you know just where you fit on the MBTI model. Behind the initials or the score is a model built on assumptions designed to reveal a picture. As a coach, to use the assessment effectively, you need to understand and be able to interpret the model. Does it make sense to you and can you see how it will be useful to your client in making better decisions?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Question 3: How do you become skilled at using the assessment?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">The Life Wheel you first used in the CTI Fundamentals course is a form of assessment: great benchmarking and an opportunity for discovery. Would you consider yourself a qualified professional coach after one afternoon of the intro course? The analogy isn&rsquo;t perfect but the point is, to really take advantage of powerful tools it only makes sense to have quality training in using the tool. Look into the credentials of the training resource and the support materials included.</p>
<p>A related question would be, what specialized training for coaches is available? Your goal, after all, is to make the most of this assessment for coaching &ndash; which leads naturally to the last question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Question 4: How does it lead to coaching?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">As coaches, discovery and benchmarking are just the starting point. The information is interesting, often personally beneficial for clients, but it is just data until you put it to work. To benefit coach and client, the assessment must lead to coaching outcomes: coach and client are able to find clear direction, better able to stay on course, to dig deeper, faster. The best assessments become the means for great conversations that lead to change, which is the heart of coaching.</p>
<p>There are other questions, too, the obvious ones: cost of the assessment, credibility of the material, validity and reliability of the instrument itself, support you can receive&mdash;especially coaching-focused or coaching-expertise support.</p>
<p>In the end, the assessment is a tool. You choose the tools that work best for you and your clients, whether you work with individuals, executives or teams.</p>
