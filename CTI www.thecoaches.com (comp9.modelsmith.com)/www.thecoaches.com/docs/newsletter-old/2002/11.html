<h2>What a Conference!</h2>



<p>
The ICF International Conference in Atlanta was full of all the passion and energy we could hope for our industry.  Coaches came from all parts of the world and with every brand of coaching imaginable, while our Georgia hosts showed us what Southern hospitality is all about!
<p>
The highlights were many including a welcoming address from President Jimmy Carter who talked about the difference coaches are making in the world.  Because the ICF mission is so in line with his personal mission, Mr. Carter asked to be an honorary member of the ICF.  We're in good company! 
<p>
Benjamin Zander, world-renowned conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra opened the conference with energetic monologues, leaps across the stage, piano playing, and stories that made the audience, laugh, cry and sing with passion.  When Ben turned 45, he realized something amazing:  "The conductor never makes a sound.  The power depends on his ability to awaken the possibility in other people."  Co-Active in his delivery, Ben invited everyone to start living in the "front row" of their lives.
<p>
CTI's co-founder, Laura Whitworth challenged us the second day by asking coaches to play their "Bigger Game". Laura's passion for changing the world was re-inspired when she was asked to take CTI training into the prison system.  The Bigger Game, a non-profit organization co-founded by Laura, brought CTI training to inmates who have transformed their lives and are now able to see the possibility of something bigger and better for themselves. ICF conference attendees donated over $11,000 to the project and were heard between sessions excitedly sharing their own bigger game. After the CCC, one inmate was quoted as saying, "Once upon a time in America, I closed my eyes. This weekend, I peeked at the world again." What a difference we are making in the world! 
<p>
<a href="http://www.blanchardtraining.com" target="_blank">Ken Blanchard</a>, contemporary author of more than 24 books, including the ever-popular One Minute Manager, and the "chief spiritual officer" of a global leadership program, was the closing keynote speaker for the conference.  Ken spoke with warmth and humor as he reminded us of why we became coaches.  He concluded by saying that "Coaching is a worthwhile and honorable profession" and "a fabulous mystery - to help human beings make life a special occasion". 
<p>
Of course the CTI booth was right in the center of it all and many new people joined the Co-Active community.  Welcome!  Many new connections and reunions were made at our Friday evening event, where Laura Whitworth and Rick Tamlyn (who was the inspirational and energetic MC for the conference) led the group in a Co-Active Leadership exercise that had the whole room laughing, crying and curious.  CTI was well represented by many of our leaders who conducted workshops for continuing education for the various coaching tracks.  We're proud of you all!
<p>
The feeling of inclusion throughout the conference inspired and called forth many coaches to take the coaching industry as a whole to the next level.  We're a young and growing profession and it's up to each one of us to do our part in guiding this industry, where we want it to go.  If you haven't already - join the professionals of the ICF.

<h2>CTI and Co-Active Space Merge</h2>


<p>
As you may know, <a href="http://www.coactivespace.com" target="_blank">Co-Active Space</a> has offered the powerful Co-Active Leadership Program created by the founders of CTI.  Leadership consists of four retreats that expand your leadership capacity and challenge you to become aware of and responsible for your impact in the world.  In the past, the two organizations stood separate for business reasons.  Today - it makes sense to bring the organizations together.  We're excited about the possibilities the merger creates in thinking beyond "coaching" or "leadership" to Co-Activity worldwide.  The good news is the same great people, programs and commitment will remain.
<p>

<h2>Keeping Our Standard of Excellence</h2>

<p>

President and CEO, Shirzad Chamine accepted the honor of re-accreditation at the International Coach Federation Conference.  CTI, the first coach training organization to be accredited by the ICF holds highly the mission and values of our professional organization.
<p>
To be an accredited coach training organization through the ICF, we operate by the ICF Standards and Code of Ethics; Have our curriculum thoroughly reviewed and meet the ICF's rigorous standards; provide fully documented leader training; provide progressive training and a comprehensive final examination for certification students, and offer unique materials that meet the ICF definition of a professional coach.  We take our programs and our profession seriously and truly set the standard for the industry.
<p>
We give great thanks to the ICF staff and volunteers for tirelessly challenging the industry to continually strive for higher standards.

<h2>The Continued Adventures of Henry Kimsey-House</h2>

<br>

Celebrating 10 years leading the industry!
<p>

Co-founder, Karen Kimsey-House joined the tour to connect with Co-Active communities in London and Oslo, where our Co-Active partners, <a href="http://www.coaching-courses.com" target="_blank">Estrella Associates</a> in the UK and <a href="http://www.startnowcoaching.com" target="_blank">Start Now!</a> in Norway have been leading courses for the last two years.
<p>
Hats off to all the community leaders and Co-Active friends whose energy and enthusiasm attracted huge crowds to these events!  Thank you all for the warm welcome and support in creating Co-Active Communities throughout the world.  This is just the beginning of community building to come!

<h2>Continuing Edge&trade;</h2>
<p>

What more can I bring the client?  How can I add more value to each and every coaching interaction while deepening my own learning and strengthening my core skills?  Whether you've got an itch for learning or need continuing education units, CTI has advanced courses to meet your needs!
<p>
If you're tired of your clients talking about their relationships without any change occurring, try our <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/registration/rct.html">Relationship Coaching Course</a>!   After all, when are you NOT in relationship?  If you thought coaching one client was fun, try coaching couples, teams and other partnerships. It is twice the excitement, twice the headaches and twice the satisfaction. (Sometimes twice the fee as well!)
<p>
Relationship coaching is different from individual coaching, as it requires you to hold several agendas and respect both partners equally.  You'll discover a new way of coaching "the relationship" as a separate entity, and show the partners to see the other's perspective, which allows new possibilities to old problems.
<p>
<i>"My coaching skills and potential have increased exponentially. This is a must for every coach serious about coaching as their profession!"</i>
<p>
Kick off the New Year, by joining Marita Fridjhon, MSW, CPCC, PCC and Faith Fuller, PH.D., CPCC, in one of the next <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/registration/icc.html">Introduction to Relationship Coaching Course</a> in Atlanta, GA, January 11th - 12th, or in San Rafael January 21st - 22nd , 2003.
<p>
The Introduction to Corporate Coaching Course (ICC) doesn't just mean coaching a bunch of suits in a major company. If you're interested in working with organizations, this course prepares you to coach in the small business, corporate and non-profit environment. You will have new information and tools to comfortably market yourself; discuss return-on-investment, establish and maintain coaching relationships within a multiple-agenda environment and tackle the corporate saboteur - theirs and yours!
<p>
No experience in the corporate world is necessary, however completion of CTI's Balance Course and registration in the remainder of the intermediate courses is mandatory. Imagine the benefit of learning what it takes to work effectively within an organization in three days rather than several months!
<p>
<a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/registration/fireheart.html">Fire in the Heart</a>, the 3-day advanced coaching retreat, successfully piloted on the Outer Banks of North Carolina at the end of October.  Through an organic unfolding process, Fire in the Heart takes the "hard work" out of coaching and brings movement without forced effort.  Coaches are then able to find and use their natural strengths to find the natural strengths of their clients. 
<p>
At the heart of the fire is a process that moves clients from bracing and avoiding fear to stepping into relationship with fear and self-doubt. As a result, they reclaim the power that they have set outside themselves.
<p>
"The thing that blew me away about the Fear and Power work was the freedom to explore fear with humor and irreverence. WOW! I always thought of fear as so serious." - Carolan Lanford-Dunn
<p>
Join CTI leaders, Virginia Kellogg and Steven Filante in the San Francisco Bay Area February 7-9, 2003 or in Boston March 16-18, 2003.

<h2>Next Stop, Israel!!</h2>

<p>

While taking the Balance Course in London, Erez Bartal was coached about his beliefs around the Middle East conflict by a Palestinian participant. Using balance coaching to see different perspectives, Erez could see his initial "truth" was that "either we (Israelis) win and survive and the Palestinians lose and die, or they win and we lose." By looking from different perspectives, Erez could better understand where others were coming from, and has committed to making a difference in his country by bringing Co-Active Coach training to Israel. The first CCC will be held in January. Thanks for your dedication and holding the vision Erez! If you know someone who lives in the Middle East and would like to connect with the new Co-Active Community, email or call Erez at <a href="mailto:integrit@netvision.net.il">integrit@netvision.net.il</a> or call 972+4+698-9818.

<h2>What's Going On?</h2>

<p>

We've grown by leaps and bounds over the past 10 years because of our excellent programs and word-of-mouth referrals from you. Thank you one and all for creating the Co-Active Coaching Community!
<p>
Our past focus was to keep up with your demand for new locations, new courses, advanced programs, etc.  Now we're taking the time to look internally to create better business practices and externally to support our Co-Active students even better in the next decade!  You may have noticed that we're already in the process of upgrading the content, look and usability of the website. 
<p>
Some of you have seen the new evaluations and others have received phone calls from our staff.  This is not "just about marketing." What we're curious about is you!  What you're up to, what you're doing with coaching, what you're needing, what you're dreaming about... Coaching is such a young and growing industry, coaches and clients are asking for more information, so they can confidently choose a coaching school or coach with confidence.  We're gathering information to help in those decisions.  Thank you for your input.  We're listening!

<h2>ICF: Call For Committee Members</h2>

<p>

The ICF has created the Internal Coaching Programs Committee whose vision is to support the design, corporate buy-in, implementation, best practices and management of organizational coaching programs. Accordingly the focus is on the support/development of coaching systems as differentiated from committees focused on the needs of individual coaches.
<p>
The committee is looking for volunteers to form an advisory support group for special projects. CTI coaches who have experience in directing or initiating a coaching initiative in their, or their client's organization as an employee or retained consultant are encouraged to join the committee. The first project will be a study/survey to determine Best Practice standards.
<p>
If you know of a CPCC or CTI student who might fit this description, or are one yourself, please send Sheridan an email with your contact information, what your background in coaching is, and whether you coach corporate individuals as an internal coach or as an external.
