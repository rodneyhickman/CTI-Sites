<br>

Community building with graduates, breakfast with leaders and special
workshops and celebrations are on the itinerary.  Henry and Karen, two of
the Co-Founders of CTI have Co-Created a workshop with their UK partners
called "Claiming Your Vision", a special workshop to delve into the skill
of geography, and bring community together to raise awareness, energy and
focus.  An evening of networking will continue to create community, talk
about the benefits of affiliating with the International Coach Federation,
form networking groups, give course overviews and celebrate CTI\'s 10th
anniversary.
<br><br>

Karen and Henry will also be leading some of CTI\'s core curriculum in the UK
and Norway and meeting with graduates and leaders to launch another ten
years of spreading Co-Activity around the world.
<br><br><br>

<span class="textHead"><br>CTI Announces New President</span>
<br>
The Board of Directors and CTI Staff welcome Shirzad Chamine, who accepted
the role of CTI\'s President/CEO in July. Chamine has been involved in the
coaching industry for the past ten years in the capacity of executive coach
and is the founding CEO of the software company, MindSteps, Inc.  MindSteps created
the first enterprise software for career development, guiding individuals
through their discovery of mission, vision, values, motivativational skills and
optimal career path.  His company attracted many business luminaries as
board members or investors including John Young, former CEO of Hewlett
Packard, Dave Duffield, CEO of PeopleSoft, Bob Swanson, CEO of Genentech,
David Mahoney, CEO of McKesson and Bob Waterman, co-author of In Search of
Excellence.
<br><br>
While MindSteps\' software has had a profound impact on thousands of
individuals at organizations such as Hewlett Packard, Visa International,
Wells Fargo and Agilent, Chamine missed the depth of the transformational
experience that is only possible through people\'s connection with each
other.
<br><br>
"When I learned of the opportunity at CTI, I knew there would be a great fit
as I have admired the work of this great institution ever since reading the
Co-Active Coaching book.  I have often wondered about the huge potential of
CTI\'s unique coaching technology and its many untapped applications to both
individual and corporate settings," said Chamine.
<br><br>
Prior to being the founding CEO of MindSteps, Chamine was senior marketing
manager/consultant to organizations such as Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard
and Autodesk.  With an MBA from Stanford, an MS in Electrical Engineering
from Columbia University and a BA in Psychology from San Francisco State
University, Chamine brings a powerful blend of business strength, vision
and spirit to the organization.

<span class="textHead">Where in the World is Henry Kimsey-House?</span>
<br>
Blow up the balloons - light the candles - and start singin\' HAPPY
BIRTHDAY!!!<br><br>
CTI is proudly celebrating its 10th year of business!
<br><br>
You\'ve probably heard rumor that one of our fearless founders has hit the
road!  Henry Kimsey-House, CPCC, MCC, co-founder of the Coaches Training
Institute (CTI) and co-author of the book Co-Active Coaching is
out-and-about celebrating CTI\'s 10th birthday!
<br><br>
Henry launched his world tour in June in San Rafael, California, with
students, course leaders, staff, people new to coaching and local coaching
groups.  Henry was then spotted in Denver, Minneapolis, Atlanta and
Vancouver with standing-room-only crowds!
<br><br>
The goal of the tour is to celebrate 10 years of Co-Active coaching and to
reconnect and build community.   Henry and Karen Kimsey-House will be
leading courses and connecting with the community in the UK and Norway.
Stay tuned for the next stop!
<br><br>
"Coaching is for anyone, not just for those wanting a coaching career.  From
the demonstration, I saw that I would be a better manager, business owner,
and life partner by learning Co-Active skills."

<span class="textHead">Advanced Courses for Continued Learning and Recertification</span>
<br><br>
The <a href="/relationship/">Relationship Coaching Course</a>
 is all the buzz!  Leaders in the field of
Relationship Coaching, Marita Fridjhon, MSW, CPCC, PCC, and Faith Fuller,
Ph.D. Psychologist, CPCC, co-lead the courses using vignette, videotape and
role-play. Using scenarios involving couples, business partners and
familial relationships, participants use Co-Active Coaching skills to move
the perspective of the relationship out of the realm of "Who\'s doing what to
whom?" to "What\'s really going on?"
<br><br>
"The Co-Active Relationship Coaching Courses gave me the foundation and
practical training to take my coaching to the next level.  My clients get
the shift and my practice is energized and expanding."
- Charles Zook, MBA
<br><br>
"I found the class profound.  I had no intention of going on with the
balance of the program, and I was moved and totally blown away by the power
of the material and the way it was presented.  I feel that this program will
make a huge difference in the growth of my coaching practice."
- Joyce Mowry CPCC
<br><br>
The <a href="/ContinuingEdge/CorporateCoaching/index.html">Introduction to Corporate Coaching Course</a> (ICC) doesn\'t just mean
coaching a bunch of suits in a major company.  If you\'re interested in
working with organizations, this course prepares you to coach in the small
business, corporate and non-profit environment. You will have new
information and tools to comfortably market yourself; discuss
return-on-investment, establish and maintain coaching relationships within a
multiple-agenda environment and tackle the corporate gremlin - theirs and
yours!
<br><br>
No experience in the corporate world is necessary, however completion of
CTI\'s Balance Course and registration in the remainder of the intermediate
courses is mandatory.  Imagine the benefit of learning what it takes to work
effectively within an organization in three days rather than several months!
Former course participants have written:
<br><br>
"Excellent and Effective!"
<br><br>
"What was most valuable was busting the myths of corporate, I now have
more of the confidence and permission needed to talk with the CEO of a
company."
<br><br><br>



<span class="textHead">Our Hottest New Course: Fire in the Heart</span>
<br>
We are pleased to announce our latest course Finding Your Voice as a
Masterful Coach
in the advanced series <a
href="/ContinuingEdge/FireInTheHeart/index.html">
Fire in the Heart</a>.  In the first
course you will go to the next level of who you are as a coach. You
will deepen your
alliance with yourself and create more alive, meaningful relationships with
your clients as you take your coaching skills to a deeper level.  Fire in
the Heart is designed and delivered by CTI Course Leader Steven
Filante, CPCC and Virginia Kellogg, MCC, CPCC.
<br><br>
The next course is October 30th in Manteo, North Carolina
<br><br><br>
