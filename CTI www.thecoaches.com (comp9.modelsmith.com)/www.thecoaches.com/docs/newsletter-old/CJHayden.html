<h1>Passive Revenue: It&rsquo;s Not  About the Money</h1>
<p>We coaches are a community of  altruists. Attracted to this profession by a deep desire to help others, we  want to give the gift of coaching to anyone who can benefit, often neglecting  our own practical needs. Many of us would happily coach without being paid, if  only we could figure out how else to make a living. This is how and why passive  revenue is exactly the right solution.</p>
<p>Too much of what we read and  hear about passive income is focused on how much money we can make. But as  coaches, that&rsquo;s not our motivation. We&rsquo;re not in it for the money. What we  really want is to help others; it&rsquo;s no wonder we aren&rsquo;t taking enough advantage  of this opportunity to help ourselves.</p>
<p>If you are open to creating a  shift in your perspective about passive revenue, explore with me the following  questions and some of my own experience in answering them:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; How can you help as many people as possible?<br />
  &bull;&nbsp; How can you have more time available to help  people?<br />
  &bull;&nbsp; How can your impact on the world make a real  difference?</p>
<h2>1. Help more people.</h2>
 <p> I started out as a coach like  most of us do, working one-on-one. Building my practice quickly over the first  couple of years, I soon had more than 20 regular clients. But then, I  discovered, I was stuck. The only way I could help one more person was if one  of my clients left. Even as clients did move on over time, I could only work  with 30-some people over the course of a year.</p>
<p>This discovery led me in two  directions, both of which resulted in passive income. The first was that I  began offering <strong>group programs </strong>so  that I could work with more clients at once. Instead of spending two hours per  month with one client, I could spend that same two hours with a dozen clients  and earn about three times as much while serving more people.</p>
<p>The second was that I began  referring coaching prospects I didn&rsquo;t have space for (or didn&rsquo;t fit my market  niche) to other coaches and collecting <strong>referral  fees.</strong> Because this gave me a financial incentive to speak with these  potential clients, I took the time to do so. As a result, more people found  coaches, more coaches got clients, and I earned extra income&mdash;a triple-win  scenario.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>2. Have more time available to help.</h2>
 <p> Working with many individual  clients and offering group programs took a great deal of time, and I discovered  I was turning down other opportunities where I wanted to be of service. If only  I had more time, I could do more to help people. So I decided to begin <strong>creating products</strong> that I could sell to  the people I was already interacting with as clients, prospects and networking  contacts.</p>
<p>My first product was a low-cost <strong>resource guide </strong>that compiled in booklet  form the same recommendations and referrals I was already making in the course  of my coaching and networking activities. I sold it to clients, people on my  mailing list and at speaking engagements.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a 50-page <strong>workbook</strong> that collected worksheets I  was already using with clients and students, and added explanations of how to  use them. Then I made an <strong>audio recording</strong> of a seminar I was giving, and packaged it with the seminar&rsquo;s handout as a home  study course.</p>
<p>Creating these products took  very little time, because they were an extension of the work I was already  doing. Because my time was at a premium, I looked for ways to leverage it by  re-using material I already had.</p>
<p>I also began to <strong>sell other people&rsquo;s products</strong>, such as  audio tapes and books composed by experts whose work I respected. I was already  recommending these to my clients, so it was a small step to start selling them  and earn a small profit.</p>
<p>Over a period of five years, I  was able to build up my passive income to the point where it exceeded what I  was earning from coaching. In other words, I bought back over half my time through  passive revenue strategies. What this created for me was an enormous shift in  my ability to be of service to the community of people I cared about. I was  able to coach, teach and write for any group I chose to serve without worrying  about being paid.</p>
<h2>3. Make a real difference in the world.
</h2>
<p>When I spoke with CTI founders  Laura Whitworth and Henry and Karen Kimsey-House, they shared with me their  motivation for training people to become coaches. &ldquo;We realized we could never  coach enough people ourselves to make a difference globally,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;But  every person we train goes out and coaches dozens or hundreds of others. We can  make much more of an impact on the world by training coaches than we can by  just coaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspired by this vision, I took  one of the group coaching programs I was leading and began licensing it to  other coaches. By offering a <strong>teaching  license </strong>for my program and training others to lead it, my work could  benefit many more people&mdash;both those who became leaders and the participants in  programs they led. Instead of impacting the lives of a few hundred people, now  I could help thousands.</p>
<p>As my program became more  widely-used, I started assembling all of my notes and examples for the program  into what ultimately became a <strong>book</strong>.  Although it did take quite a bit of time to expand my notes into book length, I  had made much of that time available by creating other passive revenue streams  first. </p>
<p>The program I created has helped  thousands of people around the world become more successful and fulfilled. The  book has sold over 40,000 copies. I couldn&rsquo;t in my lifetime coach this many  people one-on-one. But by extending my work into these other forms, I&rsquo;ve been  able to make more of a positive difference in the world.</p>
<p>So if passive revenue strategies  like these can allow you to help more people, have more time available to help  them and make more of an impact on the world with the unique value of your  work, isn&rsquo;t it time you got started?</p>
