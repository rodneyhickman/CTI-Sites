<h1> Are You Running a Business, or Are You Just Self-Employed? <br>
</h1>
<p>When you first started your coaching practice, you may have had a fairly simple 
  picture in mind. Maybe it looked like helping people to get what they want in 
  their lives while you got paid to help them. But somewhere along the line, someone 
  probably clued you in that actually, you were going to have to run a business. 
  “Okay,” you decided, “I can do that,” and set about becoming a business owner. 
</p>
<p>But wait a minute, did you really? According to Robert Kiyosaki, author of 
  <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad </em>, business owners create assets that earn money 
  for them when they aren't working. If you are earning your income by working 
  with clients by the hour, does that description fit you? </p>
<p>In fact, it's likely that you are not yet a business owner, but simply a self-employed 
  person. If there's no way for your enterprise to bring in money except for you 
  to be paid for each hour you work with a client, your business has no assets 
  that earn a financial return on their own. </p>
<p>Michael Gerber, author of <em>The E-Myth Revisited </em>, characterizes this 
  common situation rather bluntly. Gerber says you don't own a business, you own 
  a job! You can't take time off because there's no one else to do the work. You 
  can't stop working because you won't get paid. You can't sell the business, 
  because who wants to buy a job? </p>
<p>Gerber believes that the only businesses that are ultimately sustainable are 
  those in which a good part of the work can potentially be done by someone who 
  isn't the owner. That's the only way an entrepreneur can have enough time and 
  energy available to work on his or her business instead of just working in it. 
</p>
<p>If you look around at the coaches you perceive as successful—those who have 
  been in business three years or more and are making a good living—you'll notice 
  an intriguing pattern. The majority of these coaches don't just coach. They 
  teach, write, speak, consult, offer group programs or license their intellectual 
  property. They have assistants, have partners, subcontract work to others or 
  sell products. They have made the transition from being a self-employed coach 
  to owning a coaching business. </p>
<p>Is this evolution just because these coaches want to earn more money than they 
  could by coaching alone? That can be part of the reason. But financial gain 
  isn't the only motivation to consider. Here's what these successful coaches 
  have discovered: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have to spend all your time getting clients and serving clients, 
    there's no time left over to learn, grow, create and build for the future. 
    If you can earn at least part of your income through product sales, royalties 
    or fees from speaking, training or consulting projects, you can buy yourself 
    more time to continue growing. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>When you have products and programs available for prospective clients, marketing 
    becomes substantially easier. Clients can try you before they buy you by reading 
    or listening to your words, or learning from you in a group. Your visibility 
    and credibility increases because you have more to offer. Plus, many coaches 
    find it's much easier and less scary to market their products than it is to 
    market themselves. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> By making your talents available to others in formats beyond buy-me-by-the-hour, 
    your work can have a much bigger impact on the people you want to serve. When 
    people can read your book, listen to your audio, take your class, or work 
    with you in a group, it makes your gifts accessible to many more people than 
    you could ever have reached with one-to-one coaching. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are some compelling reasons to look beyond individual coaching for what 
  else you can offer your clients. If you can earn more money in less time, devote 
  more energy to your own growth, market yourself more easily and positively impact 
  a larger group of people, perhaps it's time you got started creating a product, 
  program or process of your own. Here are some suggestions for how to begin: 
</p>
<p>1. Pick a topic you know well and an audience you care about. If you aren't 
  sure what that is, keep a log of the issues your clients most often bring to 
  you. When you spot an issue that excites and energizes you to work with, that's 
  a likely candidate. <br>
  <br>
  2. Choose a delivery format for your topic that suits your skills, temperament 
  and what you see your audience already buying. This could be a simple product 
  like an e-book or audio, a group program such as a seminar or coaching group, 
  or a larger project, for example, a consulting process, assessment tool or full-length 
  book. <br>
  <br>
  3. Set aside regular time to work on your project. Get your coach or peer coaching 
  group to help you stay focused on your creation. Make it a priority—if you plan 
  to work on it only when all your other work is done, you will never find the 
  time. <br>
  <br>
  4. Don't be afraid to hire help. Almost any problem you may encounter has already 
  been solved by someone else. Writers, editors, audio engineers, instructional 
  designers and web gurus can all be hired to help with pieces of your project, 
  and the new income you earn can pay for their contributions. </p>
<p>Make a commitment to yourself to start building for the future instead of working 
  by the hour. Expand your coaching practice into a thriving business enterprise, 
  and you may just find you'll have more time to enjoy being a coach. </p>
