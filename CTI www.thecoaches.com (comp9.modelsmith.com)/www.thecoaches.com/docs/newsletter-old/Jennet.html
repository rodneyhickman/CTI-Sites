<h1>CTI Staff Profile--Jennet Lee </h1>
<p>Jennet Lee was born in Pasadena, CA, on February 25. At the age of five, her family moved to San Francisco and she has stayed in the Bay Area ever since. She says that being a Pisces helps her to swim in the moment and go with the flow. Jennet is not one of those people who complicates things in her life&mdash;she keeps things organized, streamlined and simple, which makes her the perfect candidate for the job of project administrator at CTI. She did begin small and work her way up, however, as her very first job as a teenager was doing inventory for department stores, where she says she learned that &ldquo;tracking and taking stock is a good thing.&rdquo; Gratefully, Jennet moved on in life to find us. It was a six-degrees-of-separation kind of thing that brought her to where she is today. Previously she had worked for Jim Patterson (Master Coach and CTI leader) at the Sierra Club and AmeriCorps. CTI was growing at the time and needed more administrative support. Jennet had left her position as administrative director at the University of California-San Francisco and was looking for a new environment to apply her administrative skills. Jim brought her to CTI, where her job has evolved from filling in as an administrative assistant to full-time project administrator.</p>
<p>So what does a project administrator actually do? Jennet says that her job could actually be titled &ldquo;The Ultimate Particle Wrangler,&rdquo; as she spends most of her time gathering, organizing, tracking and managing the administrative particles for various areas of CTI, including the school itself, operations, human resources and the CTI coach training faculty. She also administers the student loan program and provides basic technology support to the staff. Her favorite aspect of the job is the variety&mdash;she loves knowing something about everything (she considers herself the best at knowing how to find out answers&mdash;she may not know everything, but she does know how to find the answer!) and feels that there is always something new on the menu. It makes perfect sense, of course, that Jennet is an INTJ, the type that is known as the &ldquo;System Builder.&rdquo; They possess the unusual trait combination of imagination and reliability.</p>
<p>The best aspect of working at CTI, in Jennet&rsquo;s opinion, is the authenticity of the people. She also loves that she has the permission to fail and learn, to try new ideas and to work smarter. The best thing she&rsquo;s discovered since she&rsquo;s been here is aliveness of her &ldquo;inner kid.&rdquo; She says that &ldquo;playfulness is the spark of life,&rdquo; so Jennet likes to work hard and celebrate big! She is also the photo documenter of all CTI celebrations&mdash;we are fortunate to have her diligent records of all of our good times!&nbsp; </p>
<p>When off the clock, she celebrates by taking time out to do nothing, enjoying the feeling of completeness, then playing and having a nice yummy treat to reward herself. Jennet also says that Co-Activity shows up in her life when she is with her family. She likes just being with the members of her household and making it all work out. She loves to play together and work together with family (and she really does&mdash;two other family members are also CTI employees).</p>
<p>Some times, funnily enough, it is the simple things that elude us. What is the one thing that Jennet says she can&rsquo;t quite get the hang of yet regarding her job? Correction tape!&nbsp; Luckily for us, that&rsquo;s the only thing on the list.</p>
