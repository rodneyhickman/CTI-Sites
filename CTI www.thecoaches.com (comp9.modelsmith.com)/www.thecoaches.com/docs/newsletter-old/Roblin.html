<h1>Staff Profile&mdash;Sabrina Roblin</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/sabring2.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />Sabrina Roblin is the Vice President, School Director at  CTI. She is also our ritual keeper and space holder extraordinaire. Sabrina&rsquo;s peaceful energy calms distressed students and co-workers alike. Getting to know her better is a treat!</p>
<p>How did Sabrina get to CTI?  It&rsquo;s an interesting story. &ldquo;I was doing research for my boyfriend. He wanted to  take some classes in relationship and conflict resolution. During the research,  a friend of mine told me about CTI. I read the <em>Co-Active Coaching</em> book, came to a PR night and was sold on it  myself. We both signed up for the Fundamentals course and about the time I  finished Synergy, a job opening was announced by email for someone to  manage the Certification Program. I applied for the job and got it. My past  work experience included positions at Wells Fargo Bank and Broderbund Software,  and that experience helped me to grow into my current role as Vice President, School  Director.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;At CTI, I manage the faculty who lead our programs, manage  our alliances with the ICF and ACTO, serve on the ICF credentialing committee,  sit on the ACTO board and manage the coach training curriculum. It&rsquo;s a role  that has me hold the integrity of the programs and the quality of how they are  delivered. I enjoy working at a high level in the company and stewarding both  the work and the people doing it. I&rsquo;d have to say my favorite aspect of my job  is the amazingly talented and special people I get to work with and collaborate  with every day&mdash;the founders, management team, staff and the faculty. They all  have big hearts, and are committed to service, excellence and making a  difference.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;In addition to loving the people I work with, I love our  value of continuous learning. I am supported and challenged every day to be my  best, most authentic and powerful self. I get to bring all of myself to work,  not just part of myself, and I am constantly given the opportunity to grow. We  support each other in that. It&rsquo;s such a gift and a blessing to work in a  company that supports that!&nbsp;We are serious about what we&rsquo;re up to in the  world and we have fun doing it.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sabrina is always learning about the Co-Active way of doing  business. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m in the question of all the time at CTI. What I  like is staying awake to the question of it and always moving toward it. I work  within our Co-Active model, our values and standard business practices.  Sometimes they all work together and sometimes they don&rsquo;t&mdash;I fail at times and  keep looking to how to be more effective.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Co-Activity looks many, many different ways to Sabrina. Here  are just a few: &ldquo;It shows up in how I manage and coach my employees, how I talk  with customers about the challenges they encounter with CTI, the way I work  with the faculty, how I collaborate and design alliances with my colleagues,  how I support my own well-being, and how I support and challenge my son.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a rich life outside of CTI, as well. I have a  creative, artistic side that gets expressed through singing, writing music,  cooking and creating stained glass pieces. I love being a mom. My son is almost  16 and I love raising him and watching him grow into a young man. All I&rsquo;ve  learned through my training and experience at CTI has really served my  relationship with him. I remember before I started the courses at CTI, he&rsquo;d get  angry with me and tell me that I wasn&rsquo;t listening to him. Now we talk about  everything, and he knows I have his back and also won&rsquo;t back down when he needs  that, too. Another piece that gives me strength and supports all aspects of my  life is my interest and training in cross-cultural leadership, tools and  practices. I help my husband lead his yearly vision quests in the Canyonlands  of Utah, and I design and facilitate ceremonies for groups and individuals.  There&rsquo;s a depth and richness in creating sacred space for myself and others  that is fulfilling for me.&rdquo; </p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>If you could coach anyone in the world       (living or dead), who would you coach and why?</strong> I think it would have       to be Dick Cheney, as I make up that he is one of the most powerful men in       the world at this time and that the awareness he would get from the       coaching would shift how he sees himself and his impact on the world.       Coaching him would create a positive impact at a global level. It would       also be an opportunity to learn what&rsquo;s really going on at that level of       politics, which would be fascinating. </li>
  <li><strong>What is your favorite food/recipe?</strong>&nbsp;One       of my favorite foods is baked chicken. Baked chicken is soul food for me       and something I eat every week. One of the vendors at our local farmer&rsquo;s market       makes an especially good one that I love to eat. </li>
  <li><strong>What food do you despise?</strong> My father was a French chef, so I       grew up eating all kinds of things from a very young age. I can&rsquo;t really       say I despise anything, although sweetbreads have got to be one of my       least favorite foods. It&rsquo;s the texture that doesn&rsquo;t work for me. </li>
  <li><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t know that I&hellip;</strong>hunt       and fly-fish. My father used to take me hunting and fishing all the time       when I was young. Those times are some of my favorite memories with him. </li>
  <li><strong>What are you often times found doing       at 4 p.m. on any given Saturday afternoon?</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m usually sitting by       a pool somewhere in Central California watching my son play water polo,       cheering on the team, sharing the excitement with the other parents and       getting riled up by some of the calls that the referee makes during the       game. </li>
  <li><strong>What is the most glorious       moment/accomplishment of your life?</strong> Helping my son grow into the young       man he&rsquo;s becoming. He&rsquo;s had such a shift recently. He had the best report       card ever this last semester of school and his maturity level has taken a       leap over the last few months. It&rsquo;s noticeable even in his water polo.       He&rsquo;s playing at a whole new level, with much more confidence and passion.       There&rsquo;s nothing more rewarding and fulfilling than seeing him grow and       flourish in the world. It makes all the hard work and challenges of       parenting more than worthwhile. </li>
  <li><strong>Who's your hero?</strong> Audrey Hepburn is       one of my heroes, which is appropriate, as I was named after her character       in the original movie <em>Sabrina</em>.       She was elegant, smart, adventurous, resourceful, recovered over and over       again from challenging circumstances, succeeded in spite of them, and gave       back to the world through her work with children in underprivileged       countries. </li>
  <li><strong>Where is your favorite place to play?</strong> On downhill skis on a beautiful snow-covered mountain. </li>
  <li><strong>What would we find at your desk?</strong>&nbsp;Some       of the things you would find at my desk are LOTS of paperwork, a       collection of different colored highlighters, pictures of my husband, a       bowl full of shells from the beach in Hawaii where we had our honeymoon, a       collage of postcards from some of my favorite places, a can of Play-Doh to       remind me to play and not take things too seriously, and my big dog Angus&mdash;an       80-pound shepherd/collie mix loved by everyone in the office. </li>
