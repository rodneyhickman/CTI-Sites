<h1><strong>Certification: A Critical Path</strong></h1>
<p>Over the years, one of the  most frequent questions I have heard from coaches is, &ldquo;Should I get certified?&rdquo;  A close second is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certified already, why do I need to jump through the  ICF hoops?&rdquo; These are legitimate questions and deserve thoughtful answers, ones  that I will share with you based on two decades of coaching experience.  Additionally, I hope to provide a broader context for considering them for  yourself within your own coaching practice. Ultimately, my goal is to instill  in you a sense of why I think certification and credentialing are more  important and relevant today than ever before.</p>
<p>What I find interesting as I  considered these questions is that the answers I have given have changed  considerably over the eighteen years I have been coaching. In retrospect, I can  see that my different answers parallel the development of the profession. Let  me give you a brief sketch of how my thinking has changed.</p>
<p>When I first started coaching  in 1988, these questions were irrelevant. There was no such thing as  certification, CTI or the ICF. Coaching wasn&rsquo;t even a recognized profession. If  you said you were a coach, people said, &ldquo;What sport?&rdquo; Coaches were a diverse,  scattered lot of individual practitioners finding their way in uncharted  territory.</p>
<p>Jump ahead to 1995. Several  coaching schools have sprung up and a critical mass of coaches are finding each  other to exchange ideas and excitement about this nascent profession. A group  of us from different backgrounds, with Laura Whitworth in the lead, formed the  Personal and Professional Coaches Association (PPCA). About the same time, Thomas  Leonard founded the ICF. The two organizations would merge within a couple of  years. This marked a critical developmental milestone for the profession. What  was emerging was a shared group identity and legitimacy as a profession.</p>
<p>In this context, &ldquo;How can I  learn more?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is coaching as opposed to therapy or consulting?&rdquo; were  the questions of the day. The question &ldquo;Should I be certified?&rdquo; was still not  relevant. Certification by individual coaching schools was just beginning.  Coaches were looking to membership in a professional organization to give  credibility to their work. It was a time when we, as a community, celebrated  each new article on coaching that was published in the news. It was also a time  when regulation of the industry from the outside started to show up on the  radar. </p>
<p>Shortly after the first PPCA  and ICF conferences, a movement toward certifying coaches began at CTI and other  coaching schools. If you'd asked me then if you should have to be certified,  my answer was clear&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think the certificate meant as much as the  learning experience. I saw the rigor of the professional development that took  place in CTI&rsquo;s Certification program, particularly the supervision, as one of  the best ways to develop yourself as a professional. Coaching was still new&mdash;there  weren&rsquo;t that many coaches, consumers were not that sophisticated and your  credibility as a coach came down more to your experience than having a  credential. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today. The  profession is much more mature. The ICF has come a long way from its  beginnings. It is much more diverse, international in scope, and reflects a far  greater depth and sophistication of practice among its members. There are now more  than 10,000 members in 80 countries. It has truly become a worldwide community!</p>
<p>What is also true today is  that consumer awareness and sophistication have paralleled the growth of the  profession. Just as consumers expect their physician, therapist or accountant  to be board-certified, they expect their coach to be credentialed. They want an  objective measure of quality and assurance of professionalism. Because of its  size and scope of representation, the ICF Certification is increasingly  becoming the recognized standard of quality internationally.</p>
<p>So in today&rsquo;s context, how do  I answer the question of whether you should be certified or whether you should  be credentialed by the ICF? Well, like any good coach, I now start my answer with  a question, <em>&ldquo;How serious are you about  your professional development?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve supervised more and  more coaches and administered examinations, it has become clear to me that just  completing the courses of a given coaching school does not make you a coach. You  are ready to practice but you aren&rsquo;t fully baked. Rather, this is just the  beginning of becoming a competent professional. Becoming a masterful coach is a  journey, and we now understand it has clear stages of development, one of which  is achieving certification.</p>
<p>Today, I see certification as  analogous to receiving your college degree. Should you get your degree? If you  are going to be a professional, you bet! Certification grounds you into a  broader and deeper perspective on coaching. You gain immeasurably from the  wisdom and mastery of experienced coaches as you open your practice to  feedback. If you just want to dabble with coaching or aren&rsquo;t serious about  growing your skills, spend your money on a few good lattes and have a nice  conversation but please, don&rsquo;t call yourself a professional coach.</p>
<p>Once certified, you have your  degree, but like any professional you need some years of practice and ongoing  learning to develop mastery. The ICF credentialing process can help you define  a developmental path for yourself beyond certification. There are changes with  the new credentialing process that are now being rolled out. For the first time,  it incorporates our recognition of distinctions covering the whole spectrum of  development as a coach from Associate Certified Coach (ACC), Professional  Certified Coach (PCC) to Master Certified Coach (MCC). These new standards  represent the collective wisdom that has been gained through the years as we  have developed and broadened our perspective as a profession. We know a lot  more now than even five years ago about how we develop as a coach.</p>
<p>Setting and achieving goals  for obtaining your ICF designation will give you a clear standard for measuring  your progress as a coach. It is the equivalent of passing your boards in other  professional organizations after getting your college degree. It is the  affirmation by a community of your peers that you have achieved a professional  level of competence. What I observe, too, is that the people who go through the  process gain immeasurably by the experience in terms of learning and  confidence.</p>
<p>There is also a secondary  pragmatic reason for getting credentialed through the ICF. As consumers become  more sophisticated, they want to know you are qualified. Not having a  credential is now becoming a liability for a coach in today&rsquo;s market. Now the  certificate starts to matter to your bottom line.</p>
<p>So my answer today to those  opening questions? Aspire to mastery, commit to life-long professional  development, get certified AND obtain the highest ICF credential you can. You  will grow yourself and the profession at the same time. You will also have more  credibility as a coach as this wonderful profession continues to mature! Do it  for yourself and for the sake of your clients. It is actually much easier than  it was 18 years ago. Today you get to stand on the shoulders of the  international community of pioneers that have gone before you.</p>
