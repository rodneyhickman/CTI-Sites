<h1><strong>Leadership Through Passive Income</strong></h1>
<p>Have you ever  wondered why passive income is so interesting to coaches? Is it because we&rsquo;re  lazy and want an easy buck, for minimal effort? Or maybe we love coaching, but  want to stop doing so much of it and instead learn the ins and outs of the  Internet instead of interacting with other human beings?</p>
<p>Not hardly! I think  there&rsquo;s an entirely different and sometimes subconscious reason. </p>
<p>Passive income is  compelling to coaches because it gives us a way to deliver coaching to a much,  much bigger segment of the population than we ever could solely one-on-one.  It&rsquo;s a different way to look at it, isn&rsquo;t it? In fact, let me go just a little  bit further. I believe that coaches who seek to lead in their work will  ultimately ask themselves, &ldquo;How can I contribute to lasting change of the  greatest order, beyond myself?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of those  answers is by creating passive products of the highest quality that outlive  you. Have you ever thought about writing an e-book? What&rsquo;s an e-book after all,  right? Isn&rsquo;t it just a couple of written pages slapped together on a given  topic with a pretty cover put on? Well, some people seem to make it magically  put money in their bank accounts too&hellip;oh yes, to the tune of four and five  figures each month. Now that&rsquo;s passive income! </p>
<p>But the e-book I&rsquo;d  like to share with you is special for a different reason. It&rsquo;s written by Tom  Heck of Asheville, NC, coach and founder of TeachMeTeamwork.com, and is called <em>Team Activities on a Shoestring: How to Use  Two Normal Shoestrings to Lead 8 Fun and Engaging Team Building Activities. </em>Here&rsquo;s  just one of hundreds of comments from Tom&rsquo;s client, Don Clair, about the  powerful coaching results the e-book and TeachMeTeamwork.com helped create:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the opportunity to use your website as a resource for a learning  activity a few days ago. I was working with teens that were considered to be  challenging and viewed themselves as someone that would not fit into a team  setting. I chose an activity that allows a participant to see how challenging  life is without cooperation of those around them and how important  communication is in every situation. The activity was fun, the kids learned how  valuable teamwork is and that sometimes doing something alone is not practical.  Thank you for making this resource available to the world and especially to  teachers, treatment providers and counselors. Learning should always be fun and  you have helped me make learning fun for some very challenging students and  clients.&rdquo; <br />
    <em>&mdash;</em><em>Don Clair,</em><em>Program Development Specialist, Anthony Robbins Foundation,</em><em>Retired Drug Treatment  Counselor, Bureau of Prisons</em></p>
<p>These are words of  high praise for any coach&rsquo;s work, much less his e-book and website, yes?</p>
<p>Well, it goes on.  This 18-page e-book is truly the little e-book that could. Tom receives emails  from around the world from places as far away as remote Asia, South America and  elsewhere, telling him of the change being created as a result of his coaching  e-book.</p>
<p>In addition to the  eight team exercises inside, it&rsquo;s an example of how a coaching approach can be  replicated in print. These include debriefing or processing suggestions, so  that the teams get the most from each activity. They include guidance about  setting boundaries, creating a safe place to build trust and alternatives for  when fear occurs during the activities.</p>
<p>Does this give you  some ideas for how a coach can create passive income in the form of a leading  e-book? You can download your own copy at TeachMeTeamwork.com to see for  yourself.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ll  share about Tom&rsquo;s e-book is this: It&rsquo;s the most popular team-building games  e-book ever written and has been downloaded more than 20,000 times since he  wrote it, and it&rsquo;s free. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t  already have something, besides a sample session, that you give people at no  cost&mdash;such as an e-book or report, audio interview or sample CD&mdash;I recommend you  pursue it now. By giving so many people an opportunity to get to know, like and  trust him through something that doesn&rsquo;t require his time, Tom&rsquo;s built a  database of individuals who buy his multimedia CDs, books, assessments and even  physical teambuilding games on a regular basis. And, of course, when the time  comes, they ask him for one-on-one coaching, workshops and consulting, too.</p>
<p>For now, let me  leave you with just a few thoughts.</p>
<p>You can create  passive income many ways. Above is one leadership-based way to do it. 
  An e-book was the  central example of this article. There are countless other examples of  spectacular audio programs, podcasts, written workbooks, CD and DVD sets  created by coaches who are painting with that bigger brush and leaving a legacy  beyond themselves. The topics of these passive income products vary as widely  as how to help your child through your divorce or surviving the loss of a  family member, to peaceful pregnancies and expressing your femininity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What they all have  in common is:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>They are a solution to a problem       experienced by a group of people who identify with each other and       congregate or &ldquo;hang out&rdquo; together. (They&rsquo;re easily accessible that way.)</li>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><li>They are packaged in a way that is most       valuable to the clients. (Are they aural, visual or kinesthetic learners?       Package your passive products accordingly.)</li>
<p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  <li>They are on the receiving end of a       planned and sustained effort of people who will find it useful (and may       not be readily open to coaching in the one-on-one fashion).</li>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <li>They have a lead-in product that is no       or low-cost that doesn&rsquo;t require the coach&rsquo;s time to deliver. (Hence, the       word passive.) We call these lead-in products pink spoons.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a tremendous amount of information about  passive income in the world. You might almost scratch your head at how &ldquo;active&rdquo;  you have to be about acquiring it! </p>
<p>What works, after  more than six years of proving, testing, tweaking and refining all sorts of  strategies, tools and approaches, is the above. What doesn&rsquo;t work is if you  think passive income means easy money for little effort. What also doesn&rsquo;t work  is if you don&rsquo;t have a bigger reason than money to sustain you in the learning  curve.</p>
<p>If you want to  leave a lasting legacy of your accumulated coaching wisdom and messages,  consider passive income products. Whether you have five one-on-one clients or  50, you CAN make money and meaning in a sustainable way as a coach using a  combined approach.</p>
