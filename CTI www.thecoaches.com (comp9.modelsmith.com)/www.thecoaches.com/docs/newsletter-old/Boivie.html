<h1><strong>Magic  From the Mess: Discovering the Power of Roles in Teams</strong></h1>
<p><img width="170" height="128" src="Boivie_clip_image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://www.morguefile.com/archive/?display=111221749972" /><strong>Teams are wonderfully interesting  creatures. </strong>Sometimes a team will just roll along, everything progressing  well, with everyone getting along and getting the job done. Life is good! Then  some situation, misunderstanding or difference of opinion will get a team riled  up, and things get messy. There are undercurrents, turbulence in the system.  You know what I mean&mdash;each of us have had some experience with the good, the bad  and the ugly of teams. </p>
<p><strong>Think back to your  own experiences with teams. </strong>Remember the &ldquo;dream team,&rdquo; the one you loved to  be on? Every day was a joy. The people were skilled, aligned and full of  purpose. And now remember the other kinds: committees that were at  cross-purposes, groups that were stuck in inaction, organizations that were in  constant conflict. Usually, we say we&rsquo;re having &ldquo;people problems.&rdquo; We may  assume that these situations have been caused by certain individuals on the  team. We may even think the problem would disappear if that person were not on  the team. As a relationship systems coach, there are other and more useful  perspectives to hold in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;People problem&rdquo;  situations can be separated from individual personalities. </strong>People on a team  quite often personalize the initiator of turbulence, saying things such as:  &ldquo;Joe is difficult to get along with,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Maryanne is negative,&rdquo; to explain the  situation. However, let&rsquo;s try on another perspective, that of the team as a  functional system. Detach the behavior from the personality of the individual  and look at individuals as playing roles on the team. Joe has the role of the  Cautious One; Maryanne has the role of the Skeptic. When you really stand back  and look at what&rsquo;s happening on the team from a role perspective, other roles  may become apparent: the Initiator, the Optimist, to name just a few. Not only  is this a more compassionate perspective regarding the behavior, but it also is  useful for seeing the functional dynamics of the team.</p>
<p><strong>Roles are important to  the healthy functioning of a team. </strong>The kind of roles we&rsquo;re talking about  are not titles or external roles, such as &ldquo;manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;analyst.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re talking  about the internal roles, the functions or perspectives that individuals take  on for the healthy functioning of the system. These roles&rsquo; voices need to be  heard for the team to function well. This is as true for teams of people as it  as for intimate relationships. The roles that get played out on a team, or in a  relationship, are natural and necessary to the functioning of the system. The  natural give and take between roles is like the breathing in and the breathing  out of a system&mdash;as fundamental and necessary to healthy life as breath. </p>

The function of the  Cautious One may be to slow things down, so that a project team doesn&rsquo;t move  more quickly down a path than they are comfortable with, so things can be  thought through more fully. Or perhaps the role of Skeptic is created to play  counterpoint to an Optimist. The Skeptic may provide the team a safety net for  looking at the dissenting point of view and so help the team come to a more  considered decision. Even though some of these roles may be difficult to be  around, even a bit prickly perhaps, they exist to serve an important purpose to  the team.</p>
<p><strong>Roles in systems can  be fluid, can move around. </strong>In a completely healthy team, the roles can move  from one person in the team to another. Someone who is the voice of Caution in  one discussion might be an Initiator in another discussion. Sometimes it can  even happen in the same discussion! People do not have to be stuck in roles.  They can try out new ones, if they know that someone else will take on the role  they&rsquo;ve been playing for the team. Intentional role reversal can be highly  illuminating and useful to a team.</p>
<p><strong>Intentionally reversing roles can clarify the role&rsquo;s function to the  system. </strong>Try exchanging roles, making sure that the hand-off has fully  happened. (No taking back the role too soon!) Have the person in the new role  express the function she/he is providing. Explore the value that this point of  view is providing for the system. What is its usefulness? Whether we are  talking about a team or an intimate relationship, new understanding can emerge.  Things can settle down and start moving more smoothly. Collaboration can  increase. This is a great way for a team to &ldquo;prime the pump&rdquo; of its creative problem-solving  in the midst of turbulence. It allows new solutions to come to the surface,  deeper understandings to be created or useful perspectives to be voiced. </p>
<p><img width="171" height="130" src="Boivie_clip_image006.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://www.morguefile.com/imageData/LOWREZ/rusted.jpg" /><strong>Think back to some of your own teams or  committees. </strong>What are all the roles that you have provided for the system?  When have you been the Skeptic and when the Initiator? What other roles showed  up in other members? How easily did the roles move from one person to another?  When might you or another have been &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in a role and what did that do to  the functioning of the team? When you had someone to bounce up against, what  ideas or solutions came out of it that might not have come forward without the  spark of that dialogue?</p>
<p><strong>Magic happens</strong> <strong>when all of the voices, in all of the  roles, are allowed to speak and be heard. </strong>It&rsquo;s not necessarily a  comfortable place to be when all these voices are being expressed. It&rsquo;s not  always a pretty sight; it can feel like it&rsquo;s getting awfully messy. As a  relationship systems coach assisting the team&rsquo;s transformation, it can feel  pretty rocky. <em>AND</em> it can create  something magical, something so much better than what can be created by one  voice alone. New dreams can be created, new possibilities uncovered. This is  the power of teams, of relationships: their ability to &ldquo;make something new  happen&rdquo; is greater that the sum of all the people in the team. Transformation  and magic <em>can</em> be created from the mess.</p>
