<b>Expanding Possibilities: Next Stop Israel</b>
</span>
<p>

"On Monday the 6th I fly out to Israel to lead the first CCC in Tel Aviv with Clark.  I am very excited about this phenomenal opportunity to begin Co-Activity in the Middle East, and am grateful to Erez Bartal for his boldness and vision to make this happen.  I am also grateful to CTI and all the people who have supported this new venture.  AND I am a little scared about going to a place I have never been where there is a potential for danger and terror.  
<p>
"I remember how Mother Teresa stopped the bombing in Beirut long enough to get the children out.  Well, I am asking you powerful people to intend safety for all of the participants in this course, Erez, Clark and me, from the beginning to the end of our journeys.  I know that intentions, prayer and energetic sourcing make a huge difference.  Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.  I will let you know how this amazing adventure goes."
<p>
<em>Juhree Zimmerman, CTI Leader, CPCC</em>

<b>Courage to Act - Courage to be You</b>
</span>
<p>

Courage.  Even the sound of the word has a bold, strength to it.  Courage comes from the French word for heart:  Coeur.  When we think of heart, we picture feelings like love, joy, peace, tenderness and even sadness.  We don't picture acts of boldness coming from the heart, but they do.  The heart is our center, our core, and the source of our courage.  Courage is not a lack of fear, but a determination to push past the fear to act on our convictions - to act from the heart.
<p>
In <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the Cowardly Lion bemoans his lack of courage.  As we watch the events unfold, the Lion takes courageous actions, even putting his life at risk to save his friend Dorothy.  Courage asks us to face our fears and keep on going.
<p>
It takes courage to follow your heart, to commit to your own deepest desires.  The powers that influence you (society, parents, bosses, organizations) often convince you to become anyone but who you are.  When this occurs, you know at a deep level that you are not in sync with yourself.  It doesn't feel right.  You know something is lacking.  You want more or you want something different.  There's no joy in life.  It takes courage to step out of the conformity <em>box</em>, throw off others' expectations and be true to your purpose, your values, your gifts.  You are unique, one of a kind.  The world needs you to give what is truly you!  Courageous people have learned to listen to and trust their inner voice.  They have learned that facing their fears and acting authentically, even risking failure, is the path to personal growth, success and fulfillment.  Take heart.  Have the courage to act and the courage to be you!

<b>Networking Tip</b>
</span>
<p>

You've all heard that networking is a great way to build your coaching practice, and yet many people groan from the thought of it!
<p>
Lucky for you, your Co-Active skills are key to great marketing.  Take for instance perspective.  If you come from a perspective that networking is actually relationship building, it takes on a different feel.  The truth is, networking is about connecting with people for mutual benefit.  It requires long-term vision.  The seeds you plant are more likely to bear fruit if you carefully tend them vs. scattering seeds you ignore.  As coaches, we know how to build relationship.  Here are some tips to make your networking more successful:
<ul>
<li>Call it something else, such as <em>relationship building</em> or <em>community</em>.
<li>Have more interest in <em>giving</em> than <em>getting</em>.  It all comes around.
<li>Get more involved in activities so you can really show your stuff.
<li>Read a book on networking such as The Smart Woman's Guide to Networking, by Hadley & Sheridan (easy processes can be used by anyone), and create a plan of action.
<li>Work with your coach around your networking gremlin.
</ul>
When we come from a place of service, people will experience our coaching skills and have a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer.

<b>What's Happening in the UK?</b>
</span>
<p>

We are very excited as to the possibilities in the upcoming years.  Our experiences this year have shown us that building good relationships and respecting cultural differences is essential and cannot be assumed. Scotland gave us that lesson - thank you Scotland.
<p>
Our vision for the next three years is to have courses running across the UK and not just in London.  We will build good relationships with our neighbors with the intention of extending courses to Ireland, Scotland and Wales to support the growth of Co-Active Coaching across Europe.  It is not just about providing courses, it is ensuring that our participants can gain the information and support they need to become excellent coaches. Please see our newly designed website at www.coaching-courses.com.

<b>The Art of Saying No</b>
</span>
<p>

There are many reasons why we think we have to <em><b>do it all</b></em> but it doesn't really matter what they are.  It's time to stop and look at how we want to spend the rest of our life.  It's time to take a stand for ourself and learn one word - "No".
<p>
Obviously we can't say "no" to everything.  But we can prioritize.  We need to look at what's really important to us and say "no" to the rest.  Anything in line with your values or that moves you toward your goals gets a "yes." Anything that stands in the way of your values or goals gets a "no."
<p>
Emails are a good example.  It's so easy to respond to them that we don't stop to think about what we could be working on instead.  Before you know it, the day is gone and all you've done are a bunch of quick, easy things that didn't move you toward your important goals.  So delegate these quick, easy tasks or leave them to the end of the day, after you've done the important work.
<p>
"But everything's important," you say.  Wrong.  I know a successful CEO who would have decided on one important thing to accomplish that week and would focus on only that.  You can imagine how many people wanted a piece of his time and how everything was <em><b>urgent</b></em>.  Yet he was adamant about focusing on the one thing that would ensure success.  And guess what?  Nobody remembered that he didn't call them back, or meet with them, or respond to an email.  They just remembered the success of the big item.  
<p>
So what are your big items?  Here's my challenge -- whenever you're asked to do anything, say "let me get back to you."  Then determine how important it is to you to comply with that request.  How high profile is it?  What objectives will it achieve?  If you say no, what will the repercussions be?  Can you live with them?  If it's a low-priority item, then say "no". 
<p>
Now comes the fun part.  Watch what happens to the people around you when you start to become the guardian of your time.  Some will get slightly miffed; some will look at you with shock or curiosity.  Many of my clients found that, over time, they started getting compliments for how organized, smart and decisive they were.  So start learning to say no.  Delegate.  Treat your time as the most valuable commodity in the world.  Frankly, for you it is.
