                Colleagues,<br><br>CTI had a
                spectacular showing at the recent ICF conference.
                For those of you who were there, thank you for
                your continuous outpouring of enthusiasm and
                support, making CTI's booth the most alive and
                magnetic on the floor. For those of you who
                weren't, I would like to share some of the
                highlights of CTI's announcements that might be
                of interest to you. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana">We
                introduced our <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/business/">Business Development Program</a>,
                and the <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/">Relationship Systems Coaching Series</a>,



and participants
                at ICF were able to get an actual taste of our new
                courses.
                CTI's new Business Development Program is the
                most extensive in the industry, committed to
                making sure our graduates are not only the best
                coaches, but also the most successful coaches in
                the world. Relationship Systems Coaching is a
                groundbreaking series of courses for advanced
                coaches from both CTI and other schools, to
                dramatically expand their coaching competencies
                and market opportunities. It enables entirely new
                niche applications for coaching couples,
                partnerships, teams, and organizations. </font></p>

                        and relationships &#151; skills that are

<b>Does Coaching Work?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
Of course, we as co-active coaches know that coaching works---we've seen it in action!  But, we have probably all struggled with citing any sources that prove it beyond our own experience.  CTI is very interested in partnering with people to help support research that will demonstrate the powerful impact of co-active coaching and leadership.  One member of our community, Leigh Anne Longhurst, is doing the first ever Phd in co-active coaching through Oxford-Brookes University, and Leigh has a request.  She needs co-active coaches who are willing to participate in her study.  If you are interested in learning how you can contribute to this valuable research, please contact Leigh at <a href="mailto:leighlonghurst@hotmail.com">leighlonghurst@hotmail.com</a>.

                          Know your success formula. </strong></strong><font face="Verdana">&#147;</font>Every
                          business has a formula toward getting
                          clients. How many networking events will
                          lead to how many sample sessions, which
                          in turn will lead to how many clients.
                          Use what works and modify it to include
                          your own unique attraction. Example: when
                          I was a one-person business, my formula
                          was 3 speaking engagements (to groups of
                          10 or more) led to one bi-weekly
                          teleclass of about 6-10 people on the
                          class, which led to 1-3 personal coaching
                          clients. Once you have the formula, just
                          keep repeating it. It will save you time
                          and money.<font face="Verdana">&#148;</font>

                          <strong>2. Accept credit cards.</strong> </strong></strong><font face="Verdana">&#147;</font>My
                          business really 'grew up' when I started
                          accepting credit card payments. Before
                          that, I accepted only checks from
                          clients, and my clients would often mail
                          their checks to me late, no matter how
                          often I tried to redesign the alliance.
                          While it made many days throughout the
                          month feel like Christmas (oh look! a
                          check in the mailbox!), it made it very
                          hard to budget, make business
                          investments, etc. Accepting payment
                          through credit cards has allowed me to
                          get paid fully at the first of the month
                          from all my clients, letting my assistant
                          and me decide what to do with my money
                          rather than sit around waiting for
                          it!                          </font><p align="right"><font size="1"
