<h2>Learning and Advancement</h2>

<p><ul>
<li><b>Transform your Coaching business!</b>

<br><br>
CTI is launching an in-depth, comprehensive curriculum at the end of this September focused on the business of coaching.  Existing students, CTI graduates, and graduates of other coach training programs will realize significant value from the program.  This high impact curriculum is designed to be taken in conjunction with the Co-Active Coaching Curriculum and Certification, or can be taken as an independent course of study.

<br><br>
This exciting coursework includes training on:

<ul>
<li>Business building skills to help you market your practice and attract new clients.
<li>Key entrepreneurial skills such as creating a vision and identifying a niche, planning and follow through, and negotiating. 
<li>Operationalizing your business - handling such things as finances, taxes, and insurance.
</ul>

<br>
The business development coursework provides the flexibility for you to study just the topics you need, or design a comprehensive one-year program that will transform your existing business or get your new business up and running. 

<br><br>
Be on the lookout for an e-mail with more information later in September!

<li><b>CTI Coach Training improves Emotional Intelligence</b>

<br><br>We are excited to report that the results of our Emotional Intelligence survey are in!  We thank all of you who responded to help us assess what impact the Co-Active coach training has on building your Emotional Intelligence competencies.  Of the 25 Emotional Intelligence competencies identified by Daniel Goleman, fully 17 are either highly or moderately impacted by CTI's in-depth experiential coach training. Ninety percent or greater of CTI's program graduates report a moderate or high impact on their Emotional Awareness, Developing Others, and Communication competencies as a result of the training they received from CTI.
