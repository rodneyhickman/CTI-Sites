<b>Message from the CEO

</b>
</span>

<a name="message"></a>
<p>
<B>Dear Co-Active Coach,</B>
<p>
I have now had the honor and privilege of being at the helm of CTI for the past seven months.  I came to CTI after consulting many CTI graduates on the phone and realizing that CTI's courses had resulted in a profound and often life changing impact for them.  I had never spoken to graduates of any training or consumers of any product who were so uniformly and deeply enthusiastic about what they had experienced.  The reason for this enthusiasm became clear to me after I attended CTI's CCC (Co-Active Coaching Course).   I sent an email to everyone afterwards and called it a "masterpiece."  

<p>
During all my years leading or attending experiential workshops through Stanford University or leading public and corporate training organizations, I had never experienced a design that was so powerful in its ability to immerse the participants in deep learning while holding a fun and safe environment.  Prior to this experience I was convinced that deep and profound learning and growth experiences require difficult, painful, or long stretches of training.  Yet I saw myself and all my CCC classmates "stretch" beyond our comfort zones into skills that we never thought we had, while doing so within a context of safety, curiosity, wonder and fun.  I was astounded by the results at the end of two and a half short days.  I have come to increasingly believe that what we have created at CTI is indeed a masterpiece of experiential design work resulting in deep and lasting learning in a short period of time through an uplifting and fun process.

<p>
I am on fire about enabling the most number of people in the world to experience the gift of CTI's courses.  One uniform reaction after people take the CCC course is that this course would be valuable for anyone, not just those who want to become professional coaches.  Indeed, the course presents the Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals in such a way that people could immediately put their new skills to use in coaching, being a better manager, becoming a more successful consultant, lawyer, therapist, parent, or teacher.  We have therefore decided to change the name of the CCC to Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals, which is a more accurate description.  I would like to invite you to join me in affecting this name change.  I think you would all agree that our "Fundamentals" course is the most powerful course on the planet to teach people the fundamentals of both the skills and the being of coaching.  

<p>
Warmly,<br>

<b>So You've Met Your Future Self-Now What?</b>

<p>
The Future Self is a wonderful resource for coaches in supporting their clients towards a more fulfilling and balanced life.  

<p>
The reason the Future Self visualization is so powerful is that the subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is vividly imagined.  The more your clients visualize their future self, the quicker they embody their attributes.  The future self is constantly evolving as they move forward in their lives.  

<p>
Years ago I produced an audio tape with the Future Self visualization to use with clients and workshops.  I'll give this tape to clients after our initial meeting and then debrief them in our next call.

<p>
Once you've introduced your clients to their Future Self, don't stop there!  Here are a few simple tips on ways to use this valuable resource when coaching your clients: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Have them go deep inside (or listen to the tape) and ask their Future Self what he/she did to get past being stuck.  "You were there, what did you do?  What is my next step?"  Based on that information, have your client create action steps to move them forward.

<li>Give them a powerful inquiry. Have them look at it from the perspective of their Future Self.  How is it different from their current perspective?  Work on structures that can support your client in operating from this new perspective.

<li>Ask them to act as if they are their Future Self for thirty minutes every day.  What do they notice?  Or, have them ask themselves throughout the day, "How would my Future Self handle this situation?"  Have them try it and report back to you what they learned.

<li>During a coaching call, ask them, "What would your Future Self do/say in this situation?"  
</ul>

<p>
<em>In my own coaching practice I've been amazed at the transformation these assignments have produced.  I invite you to give it a try and watch the magic happen!</em>

<b>First Person-Relationship Coaching</b>

<p>
When I tell people I am taking Relationship Coaching courses to further my coaching skills I am often met with the assumption that I am becoming a marriage counselor. I usually smile and say, "Oh no, it is much bigger than that!"

<p>
The main reason I chose to take these courses over the plethora of other coaching courses available is that I noticed that so much of what my clients were bringing to their coaching calls were relationship-related: relationships with their spouse, boss, child, money, time, self, etc. I wanted a course where I could branch out into a new area of coaching while at the same time strengthening my skills with individual clients. The Relationship Course has more than delivered.

<p>
One of the biggest 'Ah ha' moments came during the first day when it was presented that in Relationship Coaching there is Person A and Person B and then there is the entity of 'The Relationship'  - and THAT is your client. With 'The Relationship' being your client it moves the coach out of going back and forth between each person with the focus on each individual. The coach asks 'The Relationship' directly, "What is trying to happen here?" and allows it to speak through the two people. All focus is on the relationship. Holding the relationship as creative, resourceful and whole is an honoring and extremely powerful experience for all involved.

<p>
My first Relationship Coaching session was with two business partners struggling with communication. First, we established what their individual roles (job descriptions) were as managing partners, called Outer Roles, and then looked at their Inner Roles (actions based on values or needs). In this case, one partner took on the Inner Role of maintaining efficiency while the other's Inner Role was making sure that everything was clearly understood. Both were irritated because one was constantly cutting to the chase for the sake of efficiency while the other one perpetuated long conversations so that no leaf was left unturned. Having never recognized these roles they felt frustrated and had started behaviors detrimental to their partnership. Now that these Inner Roles are specifically identified and a new understanding of how the relationship needs both roles, strategies have been implemented to honor both. Relationship Coaching has allowed these business partners to begin to shift their patterns of communication and the impact on their relationship was immediate. 

<p>
I am committed to using Relationship Coaching where it naturally shows up....and it is showing up everywhere! People are created to be in relationship to others - understanding of the 'being' and 'doing' of relationship is essential to hallmark coaching.

<b>Marketing Coaching as Community Service</b>
 
<p>
Have you looked at many coaches websites, or written your own? If you have, you know how hard it is to describe the specific benefits that a client will receive from coaching and at the same time distinguish yourself from other coaches. Every client wants, and gets, something slightly different from coaching. This can make it difficult to describe a coaching service in writing (and therefore hard to market coaching).
 
<p>
One way around this difficulty is not to market "coaching." Instead, you can create and market a community service project or program with a specific outcome. Because you design this project from what you are passionate about and the longing of a community, you can describe what the outcomes will be. This makes it much easier to communicate in writing, much easier to describe to others and therefore, much easier to market. If you have designed your project well, you are using your coaching skills and seen as a leader in that community as your project unfolds. In the process, you are exposed to potential coaching clients with whom you can have enrolling conversations.
