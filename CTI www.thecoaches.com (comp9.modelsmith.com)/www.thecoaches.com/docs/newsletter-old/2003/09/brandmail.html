I'd like to share with you a great email service I have been using for several months. It's called LetterClick BrandMail, and with it, every email I send includes my logo in color and my hand-written signature, without any extra effort on my part. It works with new messages, replies and forwards. I've heard that it includes a list-mailing feature that allows you to easily send out messages to large groups, but I haven't had the occasion to use that feature yet. This service is very inexpensive and easy to set up.<br>
<br>
I really like the way this service gives my emails a unique and professional look, and I often receive inquiries from people wondering how I got that cool-looking email. Several of my friends and fellow CPCC'ers are also now using it.<br>
<br>
