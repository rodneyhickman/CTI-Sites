Coaching has been in our culture for awhile but the definition and look of coaching are varied.  Co-active coaching makes it more real and shows how powerful it can be when the "being" of coaching is joined with the GROW coaching model, which is our "doing" of coaching."  "Whether we do a 4 hour Co-Active Coaching module or a full 2.5 day Fundamentals course there are always big "ahas!" among the sales leaders!" says Susan Valdiserri about the benefit IBM sales managers are receiving from CTI's coaching training delivered by the Bigger Game Company.

For 19 years Susan has worn many different hats at IBM, from an engineer wearing steel toed shoes to now executive coach in the High Performance Sales organization. "At the end of my first CTI workshop [Fundamentals], I realized I had finally found my vocation....this was what I was meant to do on this planet."   Susan knew her professional life was about to drastically change.  Although coaching is one of IBM's leadership competencies and one of six managerial styles, she was unaware of any implementation of individual and team coaching or deeper coaching skills/training in the company.  Her initial reaction was "I'm going to have to leave if I want to pursue coaching."   But in a moment, she made a commitment to herself to bring co-activity to the IBM sales organization.

After the Balance Workshop, Susan met with a manager who was rolling out a new high performance sales initiative and was looking for someone who had coaching experience to help train managers to exhibit more "coachlike" behaviors.  Susan raised her hand, interviewed for the job and is now involved in a broader IBM coaching initiative.  Most recently the Bigger Game Company, led by Laura Whitworth, Rick Tamlyn and Leslie Clark, delivered CTI's full coaching curriculum to a group of 30 IBM
professionals.  They completed "Synergy" in May.  "It was amazing to be a back of the room assistant and witness the power and energy of a group of IBMers going through co-active coaching training together.  I felt so proud and privileged to be a part of that team.  So many participants approached me and declared that their life has changed since beginning the training in September 2002, and they are on fire!"

"And sales leaders are hungering for this as well.   They want to know how to be effective leaders and they want to create more collaborative
relationships with their colleagues and their customers. Co-Active coaching as well as the book Leadership and Self-Deception (which is prerequisite reading for many of the coaching interventions) provides sales leaders with the skills, tools and language to allow them to be different with each
other, to trust, and to connect in a more meaningful way. This leads to
better overall organizational climate, which is a measure of what it is
like to work at a company.  According to research by the Hay Group -
Boston, a company's organizational climate ultimately impacts bottomline results."

"I feel the magic happening and what's great is that this is only the
beginning!"
