<h1 align="left"><strong>It&rsquo;s a Family Affair!</strong></h1>
<p>As a child, student, blue-collar or white-collar worker,  business owner, entrepreneur or parent, we all have one thing in common. Unless  we choose to pack our bags and build a shack in the woods, we are always in  relationship with others. And even in the woods, we are in relationship with  all that is around us. The one people-oriented relationship that is common for  most of us is our families. </p>
<p>Coaching familial relationships, whether it is with an  individual within the family or the whole enchilada, I assert, has an effect on  future generations. Let&rsquo;s face it. We are not born into this world knowing how  to be in a family. We are pretty much plopped out and presented to the world.  We are then nurtured and socialized within a family dynamic. When we grow up  and have families, we tend to parent as we were parented, even though we all  say, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do what my parents did.&rdquo; And why wouldn&rsquo;t we? If we don&rsquo;t know  what other ways of parenting are, we naturally follow in the footsteps of our ancestors.</p>
<p>As a relationship coach, I love helping people choose who  they want to &ldquo;be&rdquo; within the family context and how they want to impact it as a  result. Whether the coaching is with one member of the family or everyone, the  effect is powerful. Families get excited and nervous about being able to design  their relationship with other family members. Children get excited about  speaking their truth to parents without being judged and vice versa. It&rsquo;s not  always neat and tidy. Respect and commitment is critical. And so is having fun. </p>
<p>There are many approaches used when coaching familial  relationships. For focus and brevity, I will discuss the approach called  &ldquo;constellations&rdquo; as taught in the CTI Organization and Relationship Systems  Coaching program.</p>
<p>Constellations are used to help clients see visually and  experience kinesthetically the current structure, dynamics and roles that are  being played out in the family. They are a physical representation of the (in  this case) familial relationship, usually demonstrated through the posturing  and placement of people in a space.</p>
<p>I have used constellations with clients on the phone and in  a group setting. Both are 
  powerful ways of looking at the current family situation  (according to the client&rsquo;s perspective) and what wants to change in the family. </p>
<p>When doing a group constellation in person, it is critical  to create a safe space. Here is one example of a group constellation used to  look at a family situation. This constellation occurred during a &ldquo;Working With  Families&rdquo; class I teach at the local university. In every class, I begin with  agreements of confidentiality, respect, learning and fun. It was no surprise to  me that when I asked for someone who would be willing to look at his/her family  dynamic that most of the class put their hands up. A student was picked  randomly and when she came to the front of the room, she became my client.</p>
<p>My client talked about her current family situation and then  picked out from the audience people to represent each person, event or other  factor that had an influence on the family dynamic. It is important when doing  this in a large group to emphasize that the people to pick are not necessarily  people they know, and to go with what their &ldquo;gut&rdquo; is telling them. To show the  power of this, when this was emphasized, the client changed her mind, picking  someone she didn&rsquo;t know to represent her deceased mother. When that person came  down to the front and introduced herself, the client was taken aback as the  person&rsquo;s name was the same as her deceased mom&rsquo;s. Coincidence? When picking  people from the audience, have clients pick someone to represent themselves  first and then the next important person in the family relationship and so on.</p>
<p>Once everyone is chosen from the audience, they take on the  name of the person/event or factor they are representing. The client arranges  the people in the configuration of where each member &ldquo;fits&rdquo; in relation to the  client. It is important to remember that the first configuration that the  client comes up with may not be the true one. The client may move someone while  describing the reason for the positioning. It is important to take the time to  ensure the configuration represents the truth of the client. </p>
<p>I then have the client describe each person/event/factor, including  that person&rsquo;s role within the family context and the reason for the positioning.  I ask the client to describe what he/she believes each member of the family is  experiencing/feeling in the current configuration. The people representing  family members are asked to talk about what they are experiencing and how they  feel. I may ask them to close their eyes to help them get in touch with the  person/event/factor they are representing. Each person then gets to talk about  what it&rsquo;s like being in that particular &ldquo;position.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I ask the client what it&rsquo;s like to hear what is being said.  I have never done this where the people representing the family members did not  give insight to the client and accurately represent the perspective of the person/event/factor  they are representing. It is not uncommon to hear comments like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  why I am saying this&hellip;&rdquo; or for the client to say, &ldquo;This is really weird. They  really get what this person&rsquo;s about, what&rsquo;s going on in the family.&rdquo; The client  is then asked questions such as: &ldquo;What are you aware of when you look at this  constellation?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the impact of this configuration on you?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What  else needs to be said?&rdquo; to deepen his or her understanding and provide more  insight into current reality. I also will speak to what I am noticing. The  emotional field is also often heightened. This provides the opportunity to  increase the client&rsquo;s awareness of the impact of the emotional field on the  current family structure. </p>
<p>Everyone that I have done a constellation with has had an  &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment at this point. The process of physically configuring people into  the constellation serves to increase awareness of the relationships and roles  within the familial system.</p>
<p>The client is then asked to move the volunteers so that they  are in the configuration of how the client <em>wants</em> the family situation to look. Once this is done, the client is then asked to  notice what is different and/or the same about the new configuration. The  &ldquo;players&rdquo; are also asked what they are experiencing/feeling in this new  configuration. There is something about seeing the new configuration that  creates a shift in the client. Seeing the possibility of this new family  mapping shows the client that he/she can be a catalyst for change in the family.  The client is then asked, &ldquo;If you were to take one action step toward this new  configuration, what it would be?&rdquo; Accountability at this point is often  important, as the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; to go back to the existing family reality tends to be  very strong. </p>
<p>The client is then asked if there is anything else that  needs to be spoken. If not, the person is then acknowledged for having the  courage and willingness to open up in a group. The &ldquo;players&rdquo; are thanked, and I  ask them to shake off their &ldquo;role&rdquo; and speak their real name before returning  to their seats. </p>
<p>The process for doing constellations on the telephone with clients  is similar to the &ldquo;group&rdquo; process. The difference is that instead of using live  bodies to represent the different people, events or factors within the family  context, clients use items or draw the family configuration on a piece of  paper. Coaching then occurs with a focus on the constellation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Clients either draw or move the pieces representing their  family to represent what they would like it to be. Inquiry occurs and changes  are explored. Clients are then asked to take one action step towards the new  family constellation they created.</p>
<p>In follow up coaching sessions with clients, there is  reference to the constellation. The coaching is focused on moving closer and  closer towards the new family constellation that clients created and  experienced.</p>
<p>The impact of coaching family relationships often goes  beyond the family. Clients will frequently comment on how they are more effective  at their career and that their children are doing much better at school because  of their coaching experience. If you think about it logically, it makes sense.  Life begins at home. If you can appreciate other perspectives at home, where  emotional ties tend to be greatest, then exporting this to one&rsquo;s career or  school makes sense. Those little &ldquo;beings&rdquo; grow up to be big &ldquo;beings&rdquo; running  organizations. Coaching family systems has a positive impact in the world, as I  see it. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. How about you?</p>
