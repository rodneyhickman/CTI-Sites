<h1><strong>Staff Profile&mdash;Angie Rome  Gonzalez</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Gonzalez_clip_image002.jpg" width="100" height="139" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />Angie Rome Gonzalez is the woman with the  lovely voice and face that first greets anyone who calls or comes in person to  CTI headquarters in San Rafael. She&rsquo;s been with CTI for going on three years now and has touched many,  many lives with her deep caring and concern for student welfare. Angie is a  blessing in all of our lives and oversees this office with much love and care.  It&rsquo;s time that we all got to know her a little bit better, so look for the new  things that you didn&rsquo;t already know about Angie, and then call in and say  hello! She&rsquo;s always happy to hear from you.</p>
<p>Angie was born an Aries on March  24, 1963, in New Orleans, LA. She&rsquo;s mostly Cajun-French, with a little bit of  German thrown in (thus her maiden name &ldquo;Rome&rdquo;).&nbsp;  Her first job ever was stacking shoes at a Payless Shoe Source store in  New Orleans. She was 16 years old and took the job to feed her &ldquo;theatre  addiction&rdquo;&mdash;acting classes, university film series, costume pieces, etc. She  left New Orleans in 1990 to come out to California for a Shakespeare costuming  job in San Jose. She worked many different jobs before coming to CTI, including  selling half-price theatre tickets in Union Square in downtown San Francisco,  where she cut her customer service teeth. She eventually came to CTI through an  ad on Craig&rsquo;s List for &ldquo;Manager of First Impressions,&rdquo; a nice way of saying  &ldquo;telephone receptionist.&rdquo;&nbsp;She had years of experience in customer service  and a mom who is a life coach. She basically wrote in her cover letter that she  was the &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo; for this job. CTI agreed and the rest is history. </p>
<p>Angie started out in 2003 being said &ldquo;Manager of First Impressions&rdquo; and was  promoted to Certification Specialist not long after. She filled that role for  almost two years, then last August had her first baby. Upon her return to CTI  following her maternity leave, she chose to go back to the job that she had  first held in an effort to achieve work/life balance for herself. &ldquo;Connection&rdquo;  is in her top five values; therefore, she loves talking to students and having  the connection that happens on the phone. There is an additional reason that  Angie is so good on the phone. In her own words: &ldquo;Someone told me in one of the courses that I was a capital E (as in  extrovert) in bright red neon lights with glitter all over it. I think how that  affects my work persona is pretty obvious!&rdquo; </p>
<p>She also says, &ldquo;I love working for a company that embraces its  values in such a tangible way&mdash;we list them on our website, we read them at our  staff meetings, we explore them together as a staff and we live them to the  best of our ability.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Angie who  started the tradition of reading the values at our meeting. (She doesn&rsquo;t  necessarily like to toot her own horn, so we&rsquo;re going ahead and doing it for  her!) It&rsquo;s been a very valuable thing for all of us on staff, and we  thank her kindly.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>After Angie has completed a big  project, she likes to celebrate and relax by going to a celebratory dinner at Chili&rsquo;s, complete with margaritas and loved ones,  followed by a long soak in a lavender-scented bath. She says nobody is better  than her when it comes to connecting with people and organizing a shelf, but  she still can&rsquo;t quite get the hang of finding work/life balance since having  her baby eight months ago. Her biggest <em>aha</em> since beginning work at CTI has been her love of coaching and the coaching  courses. She says, &ldquo;Thanks to the learning that I have had as I trained to  become a CPCC, I&rsquo;ve realized that FEAR had been a motivating factor in my life for  every decision I ever made&mdash;good and bad. Being able to recognize the effect  that FEAR has on me and being able to step through it courageously is the  greatest gift I&rsquo;ve received from CTI.&rdquo; She applies what she&rsquo;s learned  about Co-Activity in the courses by listening  and really hearing what&rsquo;s going on around her in a very active way. Having a  little person at home who cannot communicate with words has really helped her hone  the skill of hearing what&rsquo;s not being said. &ldquo;I find this skill serves me in all  the aspects of my life&mdash;with coaching clients, with co-workers and with family  members.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>If you could coach anyone in the world       (living or dead), who would you coach&nbsp;and why? </strong>I&rsquo;d love to coach Peter Jackson.
