<p><img width="108" height="97" src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0606/Anderson_clip_image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" />This month&rsquo;s profile  focuses on the lovely Stephanie Lovinger. Stephanie is one of our admissions  advisors here at CTI, but she is also the resident bunny lover and humor  provider for all of us here in the office. She is a Humor type on the I Am  typing scale and that is very clear to all of us. If you hear lots of giggling  and/or outright belly laughs coming from a particular place in the office,  chances are Stephanie&rsquo;s irreverent humor is at work! Things just wouldn&rsquo;t be the  same around here without her. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at who she is and how  she came to join us at CTI.</p>
<p>Stephanie was born on October 18 in Flint, MI. She says, &ldquo;If  you&rsquo;ve seen Michael Moore&rsquo;s <em>Roger and Me</em>,  you&rsquo;ve experienced it&rdquo; (Flint, MI, that is). She then adds, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not  telling the year.&rdquo; Her first job ever was as an ice cream scooper at  Baskin-Robbins 31 Flavors. She wore a bright pink dress and pigtails, was 13  years old and was paid half the minimum wage, plus ice cream. (What a deal!) Though  she only got half the minimum wage, she did get a great workout. She says, &ldquo;My  right arm got really strong!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Wait,  that&rsquo;s only half the deal too. Hmmm&hellip;)</p>
<p>After strengthening her arm at Baskin Robbins and several  jobs later (including a number of sales and training positions for companies  such as Discover Card, Communispond and Morgan Stanley), Stephanie eventually  made her way to CTI. &ldquo;I got my CPCC in 2002. I always told myself that if a  part-time position came up at CTI that could use my skill-set, I&rsquo;d jump on it.  Then one day an email announcement came out to all CPCCs about the admissions advisor  position. Of course, I had to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephanie is now part of a team of three admissions advisors  whose role is to serve as part coach and part advisor. When a prospective  student has questions about our programs, they talk with an admissions advisor.  She says her number one priority is to help students figure out if this is the  right program for their Big &ldquo;A&rdquo; agenda. </p>
<p>When asked what her favorite aspect of the job is, Stephanie  said, &ldquo;Two things. First, no call is ever the same as another. I like variety,  and it&rsquo;s a brand new person on the line every time. Because of that, I get to  use all of the skills in the Co-Active model. From Level 2 and 3 listening, to  curiosity, to blurting my intuition. My job is just chock full &lsquo;o Co-Activity!&rdquo;  Stephanie is an ENFP on the Myer&rsquo;s Briggs Personality type indicator. The E is  great for taking with people all day long. It also helps to create her outgoing  and vivacious personality.</p>
<p>Her favorite thing about working at CTI? Stephanie loves her  co-workers. In her own words: &ldquo;I love my peeps! This organization is full of  fascinating people. It&rsquo;s also a great place to experiment at developing my  strengths and being &lsquo;leaderly.&rsquo; There is so much permission to be who you are  and contribute from there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She also loves to spend time with co-workers outside of the  office, especially when celebrating the completion of a big project. Sometimes  she&rsquo;ll go with some of the staff to Celia&rsquo;s, a local Mexican restaurant. She  finds that the margaritas there are quite refreshing. Other times she likes to  sit on her new patio at home and just say Ahhhhhh.</p>
<p>The biggest aha she&rsquo;s discovered about herself since  starting working at CTI is that people actually rely on her to bring fun,  energy and play into the workplace&hellip;and that it really is necessary. In  addition, no one is better than her when it comes to loving bunny rabbits. She  says, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get enough of these cute little creatures. Now that  everyone is on to this, I have been gifted with scads of bunny-related  paraphernalia, from a pez dispenser to a bunny-of-the-month calendar.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The thing she still can't quite get the hang of? Sitting  still for too long.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
When asked about Co-Activity, Stephanie says, &ldquo;I use it all  of the time in a million different ways. One interesting thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is  that my own brand of creativity has really opened up for me since 2001, when I  started my CTI training. Coincidence? Maybe, but I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Another  recent opening for Stephanie is that she just started teaching her favorite  exercise class. It&rsquo;s called the Bar Method. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a student for years, and  I&rsquo;m finding that I absolutely love teaching it. Who knew? It feels like this  realization is leading me to my next coaching niche.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>If you could coach anyone in the world  (living or dead), who would you coach and why?</strong> The actor, Julian McMahon.  OK, it wouldn&rsquo;t really be ethical, as I would have ulterior motives. After that  it would be Benjamin Franklin.</li>
  <li><strong>What is your favorite food/recipe? What  food do you despise?</strong> Fave food is ice cream. I don&rsquo;t much care for bologna.  And yuck to marzipan. </li>
  <li><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t know that I</strong>&hellip;like to  listen to sad music and cry.</li>
  <li><strong>What are you often found doing at 4 p.m. on  any given Saturday afternoon?</strong> Oh, probably napping.</li>
  <li><strong>What is the most glorious  moment/accomplishment of your life?</strong> When I realized that I had created a  wonderful relationship with my parents. This has been both an accomplishment  and a gift for all three of us!</li>
  <li><strong> Who's your hero?</strong> Underdog and Steven  Colbert </li>
  <li><strong> Where is your favorite place to play?</strong> Anywhere. </li>
  <li><strong> What would we find at your desk?</strong> Clutter,  bunnies and a picture of Julian McMahon. </li>
</ol>
