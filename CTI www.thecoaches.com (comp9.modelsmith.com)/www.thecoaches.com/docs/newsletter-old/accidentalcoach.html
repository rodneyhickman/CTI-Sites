<h1><strong>The Accidental Coach:&nbsp; A Synchronistic Business, A Fulfilling Life</strong></h1>
<p>As I was thinking of writing this article, something synchronistic happened: The phone rang and suddenly, I had an opportunity to appear on one of Canada&rsquo;s national TV networks to talk about coaching.</p>
<p>That event met my &ldquo;Quadruple P&rdquo; definition of synchronicity: The coming together of events which are 1. un<u>P</u>lanned, 2. un<u>P</u>redictable, 3. <u>P</u>ulled to me and 4. <u>P</u>erfect.</p>
<p>1. <strong>unPlanned</strong>. I did not have an appearance on national TV as a goal. In fact, I was not actively targeting TV stations as part of any marketing strategy at all.</p>
<p>2. <strong>unPredictable</strong>. I had no idea, not even an inkling, that this was in the works.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Pulled not pushed</strong>. Pulling events (and clients) towards me involves focusing on high-level goals and trusting that the details of attaining the goal will take care of themselves. In CTI language, it is like having a Big &ldquo;A&rdquo; goal that I articulate in this way, &ldquo;<em>I love my life, I love my work, and I attract abundantly all that I need to flourish, increase and make a difference.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; I have repeated this statement hundreds of times. It is one of my Focus Statements.TM</p>
<p>There is something about <em>pushing</em> to make things happen that doesn&rsquo;t work for me. It&rsquo;s not that I can&rsquo;t push things into being. It is just that the pushing has costs. For one thing, it takes up and consumes valuable space, time and energy. More importantly, I find that the pushing results in outcomes that often backfire. For example, as a new coach, I would sometimes pressure folks to have a sample session. The backfire is that the pushed people are likely to show up with a ho-hum attitude and, in the end, cannot enhance my business. Pushing, then, is unnatural for me at two levels: a) at a doing level; and b) from a &ldquo;being&rdquo; level, interfering with what I consider the universal flow of abundance and synchronicity.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Perfect</strong>. I propose that one cannot embrace synchronicity without trusting in two fundamental principles: </p>
<p>a)<em> &ldquo;Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is perfect.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; This is a paraphrase from poet and author, David Whyte. It just seems to make sense in the context of <em>&ldquo;Nobody gets to be wrong</em>.<em>&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>b) <em>&ldquo;There are no accidents</em>.<em>&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; If everything unfolds in some sort of perfect way, then it follows logically that there are no accidents. I hold the &ldquo;no accidents&rdquo; perspective to reflect an understanding that we have contributed somehow to the unfolding of the events around us. </p>
<p><strong>So &hellip; Just Do Nothing?</strong></p>
<p>Does all this that mean I sit around my home office and do nothing? Hardly!</p>
<p>What I have done is put myself &ldquo;out there&rdquo; by networking, meeting people, joining professional organizations, developing relationships and truly trusting that I will pull to me the perfect people, opportunities and clients. Also, I&rsquo;ve developed materials to support my corporate initiatives, and I&rsquo;ve learned about and integrated assessments that are desirable to corporate clients. I&rsquo;ve invested in a professional logo and website. I write articles. </p>
<p>Has it worked? It has. As I look back through my rear-view mirror, I share with you a few of the highlights of being an accidental coach:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coaching found me. I am a coach largely because of an invitation to join a coaching business. At the time, I had not even heard of coaching outside the sports arena. Who could predict it would connect so completely to my passion and my purpose?</li>
  <li>My first big contract came as a result of connections made with a childhood friend. He and I had not spoken for years, but he sent one of his employees to a Lunch &rsquo;n Learn I hosted. About a year later, that employee contacted me &ldquo;out of the blue.&rdquo; We quickly put together a proposal, and I won a contract for $20,000, one of three companies chosen out of 18 submissions. </li>
  <li>Two years later, that contract led to another, larger contract with the same organization. To this day, I continue to coach and do workshops there.</li>
  <li>Getting back to the national TV example, it is interesting to note that another coach was approached to do the segment. The TV producers thought they were contacting my colleague to appear on their show. In fact, they were simply contacting someone who could be a conduit to me. If that sounds arrogant or flippant, it is not meant to be. It is meant to be an acknowledgement of the mystery of synchronicity. <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is Everything Always Rosy?</strong></p>
<p>Despite the wonderful non-accidents that brought wonderful clients and contracts to me, there have been times when I questioned the feasibility of my work from a business perspective. For example, during the early part of 2003, I didn&rsquo;t make a dime. Zippo. Nada. I questioned if I would ever coach again. I actually sat in my housecoat for about 3 days, not depressed, but reflecting on my future as a coach. I felt that I had done everything I could from a business perspective. In the end, I simply surrendered all of it to my Higher Power. </p>
<p>Within a day, the phone rang. A contact I had made in another province over a year earlier remembered me when wanting a workshop. I was back in business.</p>
<p>Invite synchronicity&mdash;focus, focus, F.O.C.U.S.</p>
<p><a name="OLE_LINK3"><strong>F</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Figure out</strong> what you really, really, <u>really</u> want. This is the Big A stuff!</p>
<p><strong>O&nbsp; &nbsp;Operate</strong> from what you want, instead of what you don&rsquo;t want; i.e., health instead of &quot;not sick;&quot; wealth instead of &quot;not poor.&quot; The gremlin is a master at focusing on what you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Calibrate</strong> who you <em>are</em> with what you want. &ldquo;Doing&rdquo; your business or your life without connection to your heart makes it all small &ldquo;a.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
<strong>U&nbsp; &nbsp;Unleash</strong> (disconnect from) the voice of the gremlin.<br>
<br>
<strong>S&nbsp;&nbsp; Surrender</strong> to synchronicity.</p>
