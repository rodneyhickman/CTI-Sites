<h1> The Beat Goes On</h1>
<p> I shimmy for coaching. Gliding across the dance floor, step-touch-hip-step 
  to a Turkish karsilama rhythm while playing finger symbols with more zest than 
  skill, I am aware of my coach training as a metamorphosis of mind, body and 
  soul.<br>
  <br>
  What's changed for me? My biggest challenge is enjoying the present and relinquishing 
  the analytical chokehold I place on unfamiliar situations. This homogenous approach 
  thrives in command-and-control corporate structures. It is stifling and unsustainable 
  as a life approach. While I knew this from being coached, I didn't put the pieces 
  together completely until I started coach training.<br>
  <br>
  CTI courses moved me from the boardroom to the ballroom, where big and small 
  steps choreograph new meanings. Through the hard work of play, I continue to 
  expand my reach. Newfound strengths are supporting shifts I had previously never 
  thought possible. For example, balance coaching prompted me to revisit relationships 
  that were stagnant or strained and to try different perspectives. I stopped 
  predicting conversations and started practicing powerful questions of seven 
  words or less. I describe balance coaching as the &#8220;domino theory&#8221; 
  of life, where words, used with care, can be soft as delicate, smooth melodies. 
  Amazingly, just tiny shifts in my perspectives and their phrasing bring not 
  only positive forward action, but one shift impacts the next relationship and 
  the next, bringing vibrancy, soothing old hurts and creating momentum like water 
  rippling in a pond.<br>
  <br>
  A friend advised me that success in my own coaching practice would come through 
  small steps every day. When he said this, I remembered the simple balance exercise 
  of standing on one foot only to discover that we are always vibrating with motion. 
  How could I spice up that practice? I am learning to belly dance as a beautiful 
  daily reminder of life's rhythms. As a former executive, belly dancing would 
  not have registered to my mind in any shape or form. Indeed, the joy of coaching 
  is in the learning. Several senior executives do not know it yet: While zills 
  (finger cymbals) are not a line item on the P&amp;L, I do include them as a 
  topic teaser in their coaching welcome packs (&#8220;What&#8217;s the rhythm 
  in this organization today?&#8221;). <br>
  <br>
  Neither I, nor the boardroom, will ever be the same. That's metamorphosis. <br>
