<h1 class="style1"> Certification&mdash;Why Bother? </h1>
<p class="style2" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Becoming certified as a Co-Active coach is a big choice. It is a choice because at this point, no specific coach training, much less certification, is needed to coach and work with clients. It is a big choice because doing certification takes a lot of time, money and energy, all of which are very big things to most of us. What is so important about a program that is not technically required and is such a big commitment? In other words, why bother? You bother because you want to be a really good coach.</p>
<p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;">As a leader for CTI, the thing I am so often moved and inspired by is how much CTI students truly want be of service and give value to those they coach. They want to do a good job. Not for the sake of &ldquo;doing it right,&rdquo; but because it is so important to them that people have wonderful, dream-filled lives. This desire to be skilled and knowledgeable, and the true wanting to support and make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives, is what makes certification such a natural and integral choice for those on the coaching path. It is through the rigorous, exhilarating, humbling rollercoaster and crucible that is the Certification Program that solid, reliable skill and competency develop. The program stretches and challenges people to become the best coaches they can be and to trust the coach that they already are.</p>
<p class="style2">When I started certification almost six years ago, I was already a fine coach. I&rsquo;d done some coaching before I started CTI, and through the weekend courses, I learned tons more. I&rsquo;d gotten great feedback from my fellow classmates and from the course leaders. I was doing fine and could have started my practice and continued on my way at the skill level I was at, but like so many of the people I see in courses today, I wanted much more than to be just a &ldquo;fine&rdquo; coach. I wanted to give my best to my clients, and to myself. We all deserved that. For the first time, I realized that I deserved and wanted to be my best for me because I loved coaching so much. My clients deserved the best from me because their lives and dreams are worth it. Certification moved me far past the &ldquo;fine&rdquo; category of coaching and into the &ldquo;solidly and reliably good&rdquo; category. It is also where I got my grounding and identity as a coach. For the first time, I had multiple clients, I was getting paid, and I was coaching almost every day. Coaching became integrated into my life and coaching as a career became real rather than a dream. </p>
<p class="style2">As an examiner, I often find myself examining new coaches in the very same room where I took my exam. It reminds me not only of where I was those years ago, but how much the learning I got in certification continues to be the strong foundation for the coach I am today. When I passed my exam, it was the first big milestone in a career that I still love. It came with some wonderful successes and a few bumpy failures. I wouldn&rsquo;t change any of it, especially the bumpy failures because that&rsquo;s where I learned the most. I have had many milestones and lots of other training since then, but none more important or impactful.</p>
<p class="style2">Don&rsquo;t skip the certification milestone in your coaching journey. While I haven&rsquo;t even touched on the huge professional importance of being certified, becoming certified is about so much more than having proof that you have been through a rigorous learning program. From my perspective as a coach, course leader, CPL and examiner, giving yourself the gift of certification will, without a doubt, transform the way you coach and the way you think of yourself as a coach. This is a very, very big deal. And, a big choice. Go for it!&nbsp; </p>
