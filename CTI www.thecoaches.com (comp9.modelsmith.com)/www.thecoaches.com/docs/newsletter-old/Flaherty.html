<h1><strong>Getting Myself Out of the  Way Around Money and the Selling of Coaching!</strong></h1>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">The  &ldquo;selling&rdquo; of coaching and the money conversation are areas I have struggled  with. Gremlins lurk in my preconscious mind saying things like, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say no  when she hears my fees.&rdquo; &ldquo;If I raise my fees I&rsquo;ll lose clients.&rdquo; &ldquo;No one will  pay that!&rdquo; &ldquo;How dare I ask for that fee?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody who can pay me  more.&rdquo; (Can you hear the Whiner, Fearful and People Pleaser gremlins?)&nbsp; </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Another  gremlin says things like, &ldquo;Clients will come to me; I just have to show up!&rdquo;  (Note: This actually happens often, yet I still undervalue my services.) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  greedy wanting more money; I&rsquo;m getting by.&rdquo; &ldquo;Salespeople are vultures; I don&rsquo;t  want to be a vulture.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I &lsquo;sell&rsquo; spiritual coaching? This is my  ministry.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I place a monetary value on something so intangible and  sacred?&rdquo; Can you hear the &ldquo;Miss Spirituality 2006&rdquo; gremlin? (Who else do you  hear? I&rsquo;m curious!)</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">These  gremlins are generated by fear: of not getting enough, having enough, being  enough, doing enough, having answers, being greedy and a vulture, losing a  client or a prospect. Physically, my mouth gets dry, I clench my jaw and  throat, my stomach knots, and I stop breathing. My head starts racing. I lose  my connection with my client or prospect and my inner guidance, and go into  fix-it, do-it-right mode. If I am unable to stop the spiral, I can be left  feeling totally incompetent, providing lots of ammunition for the Judge, Jury  and Hangman gremlins.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">These  reactions signal that this is definitely an edge for me, as it is for many of  my clients! I have learned to note this fear when it crops up,&nbsp; then check in with the client to determine if  it&rsquo;s theirs or mine. If it&rsquo;s theirs, we explore it. If it&rsquo;s mine, I breathe  through it and mentally tuck it away to deal with it later. When I have not  been able to do this, the session becomes stilted, the dance is disrupted and  the fear morphs into my questioning my competency. In these moments, I have  learned to either tell on myself or take a deep breath and get back &ldquo;over  there&rdquo; with my client. Telling on myself often creates the opportunity for a  deeper intimacy with my client, and I can do that without getting  inappropriately personal: &ldquo;I just got distracted for a second,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Something  you just said got my head going. Would you mind giving me a second to get back  over with you? Thanks!&rdquo;&nbsp; Depending on our  relationship, the client may ask me to share more deeply. I&rsquo;ve found that when  I share my vulnerabilities, it gives clients permission to share theirs and our  relationship deepens. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">This  money/selling edge has affected my ability to appropriately value the service,  experience and expertise I bring to people&rsquo;s lives. More importantly, this and  my other edges affect how I relate to clients with similar issues, meaning that  I potentially hold them in less-than-empowering positions. I am selling my  clients short by not dealing with these issues in my own life.&nbsp; </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Through  the self-management tools of mindfulness, detachment and deep listening, I have  seen that these gremlins represent the obvious voices regarding my edge in this  area. They are the &ldquo;A&rdquo; team. The real seduction of these conversations is the  protection afforded from dealing with a deeper issue: what is it that I am  really committed to? There is a distinction between <em>wanting </em>what I say I want and <em>having</em> what I say I want. If I say I want to be earning what I think I deserve, do I  really mean it? Or am I uncomfortably content to stay stuck in the story of <em>wanting</em> to earn more, stewing in the  continued elusiveness, familiarity, comfortable discomfort and stories that  being in <em>want</em> creates?</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">I  asked myself this hard question and saw that I <em>have </em>been more comfortable being &ldquo;in want&rdquo; than being committed to <em>having</em> what I want. Once I acknowledged,  felt and let go of the ensuing hurt, sheepishness and activated Judge this  awareness brought, I seriously began to inquire as to what it is I want. This  inquiry raised my consciousness of how I use the word &ldquo;want&rdquo; in conversation  and how it shows up in what my clients are saying, leading to some revelatory  discussions and choices for them!&nbsp; <br />
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">
  If  I truly am committed to having what I say I want, I need to take action. I  started to take a hard look at my beliefs about money and what it means to sell  my services. As soon as I began this inquiry, people who are wealthy and  successful started to show up to support and challenge me. I am working with a  coach who is challenging my beliefs about money, selling and partnership. I am  learning facts about money from a woman who educates people about money,  empowering them to build wealth. I pass this information on to my clients.</p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">My  focus has shifted to being more focused on the having not the wanting, on the  process rather than the goal. I have restructured my fees and my approach with  prospective clients. My coaching has reached a higher level of integrity,  sharpness, connection and effectiveness, and my clients are making great  progress in achieving their goals. </p>
 <p style="margin: 10 0 0 7">Self-management  through gremlin awareness, honesty, taking a hard look at myself and changing  some core beliefs, has led to insights that benefit my clients&rsquo; lives and my  own. We all get to win! Continual self-management and growth for the sake of  the whole is a priceless benefit of being a coach, repeatedly confirming for me  that this <em>is</em> a sacred calling&mdash;and  that&rsquo;s not my gremlin!</p>
