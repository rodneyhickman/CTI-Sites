<title>A Mouse Tale</title>
<h1> A Mouse Tale</h1>
<p><br>
  Once upon a time, there were eight curious mice. They were placed together to 
  share a journey of discovery and learning, the ultimate prize being four letters 
  of acknowledgment trailing their names. They scurried about gathering kernels 
  of knowledge. Some days, their bounty was plentiful, and some days there were 
  fierce predators with beady eyes and gnashing teeth, cleverly disguised as gremlins. 
  These feisty mice stayed strong and made a pact that they&#8217;d remain together 
  until every last one of them had gathered up each and every letter no matter 
  how long it took!<br>
  <br>
  One year later, they all had their letters! Two years later, six mice are still 
  convening! They simply can&#8217;t complete! What is it about completing that 
  they can&#8217;t be with? It is that they&#8212;we&#8212;have so much to reach 
  for and so much to contribute that we are simply never done. We have created 
  a successful pod beyond the certification process. <br>
  <br>
  The mice have created a community of practice. We are truly co-activity in a 
  group. We are our own business development group. We saw a need to have continued 
  learning and development, and filled the gap. The mice are a sisterhood. We&#8217;ve 
  still not all met each other in person and yet we can&#8217;t imagine our lives 
  without each other! This doesn&#8217;t just happen. It takes work. It takes 
  continual morphing.<br>
  <br>
  Here&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve done it:
<ul>
  <li>Design and re-design the alliance</li>
  <li>Holding of a sacred, safe space</li>
  <li>Speaking hard truths</li>
  <li>Coaching on and off the weekly call</li>
  <li>Bed &amp; breakfast accommodations for traveling mice</li>
  <li>Creating a CTI &#8220;alumni&#8221; experience</li>
  <li>Having guest speakers share their wisdom</li>
  <li>Commitment to &#8220;be&#8221; coaches in the world, changing it one client 
    at a time!</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite those interested in learning more to join us on a call! <br>
