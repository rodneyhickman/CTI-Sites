<h1> <strong>A Journey of Awareness</strong> </h1>
<p>Ever experience what we call serendipity, or synchronicity? It looks something like this: You are thinking about your best friend from college and she/he calls. You meet someone new and connect so deeply it changes your life forever. Recently, a good friend registered for a workshop, unsure from where she was going to get the money to pay the balance. A few days later her sister called and offered the $500.00 she had won on a layover at the airport in Las Vegas. Serendipity?&nbsp; Synchronicity?&nbsp; Whatever we call these events, they change our lives forever. </p>
<p>The dictionary defines synchronicity as the coincidental occurrence of events (especially psychic events) that seem related but are not explained by conventional mechanisms of causality. C. G. Jung loosely defined synchronicity as &quot;a fortuitous intermeshing of events.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is my story. In fall of 1998, by chance I met man in a coffee shop and he handed me a book. He said this book was for me, not for him. Surprised, I graciously accepted the book titled <em>Initiations, A Woman&rsquo;s Spiritual Adventure In the Heart of the Andes</em>. I devoured the book as I rode the train to and from work. Each word spun me into another world. I vowed to meet the author some day. Yeah, right! What were the chances of that? The following year, on Earth Day 1999, I attended a celebration at the Pavilion in Concord, California. On the way out, late in the afternoon, hot and tired, I noticed a brightly clothed woman who was behind a table, holding THE book. I approached, picked up the book and stuttered, &ldquo;This book changed my life.&rdquo; Both stunned, we gazed at each other and then just embraced and cried. She was the author. </p>
<p>Who would have thought that receiving a book from a man I did not know would send me on my journey of awakening, awareness into learning the magic of ritual, energy work and self-growth, including coaching?</p>
<p>Recently, a sense of urgency had been overwhelming me. I&rsquo;d been struggling to figure out how to integrate my healing practice with my coaching practice. Having a serious talk with my higher power (insert your preference here, please), I asked the Universe for a sign. And&hellip;I asked that the sign be undeniably recognizable and that it guide me to integrating my business. That very evening, while having dinner in a restaurant with Christine, another friend, Linda, came in with seven others. Linda invited us to join all of them for another cup of coffee. I sat for a moment in awe. THIS was unmistakably the sign and answer to my request. You see, Linda and the others in her group were all healers. That evening, they invited me to join them the following week and participate in their healing circle. I showed up the next Wednesday and discovered how I have joined my healing and coaching practice as I worked with people. The deep connection and invitation underscored for me that I need to bring this work together with my coaching. The result was phenomenal. I am now attracting to my practice men and women who consciously desire to discover and live their soul purpose, through creating ritual and magic.</p>
<p>Synchronicity is happening all around you. Do you notice? You see, the Universe wants what is best for you. Your highest good is its agenda. Your job is to be aware and notice the answers that are there. When you know and declare what you want, the Universe responds with miracles. Julia Cameron, the author of <em>The Artist's Way</em>, explains it this way: &quot;In my experience, the universe falls in with worthy plans and most especially with festive and expansive ones. I have seldom conceived a delicious plan without being given the means to accomplish it. Understand that the &lsquo;what&rsquo; must come before the &lsquo;how.&rsquo; &nbsp;First choose what you would do. The how usually falls into place of itself.&quot;</p>
<p>I challenge you to take action today to recognize the magic of synchronicity in your life.</p>
