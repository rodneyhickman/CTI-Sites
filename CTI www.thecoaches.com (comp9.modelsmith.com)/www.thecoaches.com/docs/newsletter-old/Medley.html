<h1 align="left">Feel Comfortable in Your Own Skin</h1>
<p>Your  body is a mirror of who you are. It reflects how comfortable you feel in your  own skin, literally and figuratively. Somatic coaching recognizes that the body  is a powerful source of impact, as well as information. It honors the body and  all that it communicates as a central focus and keeps it present while  addressing other areas of a client&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p>Your  body is a map of your life's experiences, belief systems and habits, which are  reflected in how you carry yourself and move in the world. You make a powerful  impact without saying a word. Somatic coaching helps clients shift how they  experience their body as they shift their life. For example, if clients want to  move into a higher degree of leadership at their workplace and they are  carrying around a posture of a tentative 14-year-old, they need to literally  embody a new way of being. They need to develop the body of a leader in their  non-verbal communication and presence, in addition to what they say, how they  say it, and the actions they do. This holistic approach, making changes in the  body-mind, as well as shifting thoughts, belief systems and life practices,  leads to achieving greater <em>sustainable</em> success. </p>
<p>Your  body is also a precious resource. It contains the fuel, your energy, to move  you through your life. If clients are not getting enough sleep, are addicted to  adrenalin, live off coffee as their &ldquo;water&rdquo; intake, or are lacking in their  fruit and vegetable consumption, they will suffer. At a cellular level, their  body is in drag and depletion mode. Coaching takes energy and lots of it.  Clients need to build their physical reserves as much as they need to draw from  their psycho-spiritual-emotional wells. </p>
<p>In  addition to enhancing health, relaxation is an important element of tending to  the somatic aspect. When the body is more relaxed, there is greater access to  inner wisdom, source energy, and empowering thoughts and beliefs. Imagine  clients wrestling with a decision when their nervous system is on overdrive and  they are literally wound up. What would happen if they took some deep breaths,  stretched, shook out the tension, and placed their feet back on the ground&hellip;what  is possible from this place? </p>
<p>When  I began coaching, I knew that I had to integrate the wisdom of the body into my  work. Being a massage therapist, I have literally touched hundreds of bodies  and witnessed the flow, or lack, of energy leading movement classes and  workshops. How could I support clients in making changes and ignore the somatic  aspect of who they are?&nbsp; How could I hold  people&rsquo;s sacred life in my heart and not address their hunched shoulders and  ungrounded stance or sleep deprivation and dehydration? </p>
<p>I  have addressed this by including an exquisite physical health assessment to  determine the degree of energetic self-care. Clients can choose to enhance  their activity level, nutrition or restful practices as they change their  career, for example. I also incorporate a personalized version of Free the  Inner You&trade;, a movement-based program for physical, personal and global  transformation that I have created. Clients assess their level of comfort and  connection to different areas of their body, as well as a range of &ldquo;states of  being,&rdquo; e.g., playful, confident and powerful. Using this information, I offer  them movement practices to guide them to <em>remember</em> their natural state of  ease and embody their dynamic range of self-expression. This not only enhances  their physical health and personal presence, it also contributes to global  transformation by having people exercise their power of choice to literally &ldquo;be  the change you wish to see in the world&rdquo; at a cellular level.</p>
<p>I  believe that somatic coaching is a core ingredient in the success of  sustainable transformation&mdash;in addition to just feeling good. Making peace with  one&rsquo;s body is a critical step in making peace in one&rsquo;s life, as well as in the  world.</p>
