<h1> Top 10 Ways to Avoid Commitment to Your Life&#8217;s Work</h1>
<p> I have compiled a Top 10 list of favorite strategies used to avoid bringing 
  our gifts to the world. The Co-Active Coaching model holds the fundamental premise 
  that we are creative, resourceful and whole. And never more so, I might add, 
  than when we are avoiding commitment to our dreams. <br>
  <br>
  Here is my Top 10 list, offered in the spirit of celebrating all that makes 
  us human, including the breathtaking resourcefulness used to avoid our magnificence. 
  What we can make light of, we can often be more at choice with. <br>
  <br>
  Here&#8217;s to humor and playfulness in our coaching and life. <br>
</p>
<p> <b>1. Trust your fears</b>. Be certain that you will be unable to afford health 
  benefits or earn a living. Dream up your worst case scenarios&#8212;don&#8217;t 
  dream small here.<br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Say YES to everything.</b> Fill your life with distraction and drama. 
  Make sure you don&#8217;t have any time to reflect. Go for frenzy!<br>
  <br>
  <b>3. Believe that there is no connection between mental and physical well-being.</b> 
  Eat poorly and don&#8217;t get exercise. Check out those reality TV shows and 
  late night reruns.<br>
  <b><br>
  4. Seek out relationships that are demeaning to self-esteem.</b> Cultivate critical, 
  stuck, depressed friends and authority figures.<br>
  <br>
  <b>5. Strengthen your &#8220;Yes, BUT&#8221; muscle.</b> Start small here. Determine 
  the lack of feasibility in anything that you are interested or excited by. For 
  example: &#8220;I want to write, but I don&#8217;t have a good pen.&#8221; Or 
  how about: &#8220;I&#8217;d love to be a singer, but I don&#8217;t have a good 
  enough voice.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  <b>6. Stick with the three Cs: Compare, Compare, Compare.</b> Compare yourself 
  to others. Be relentless here. Allow the expertise of others to undermine your 
  unique vision and credibility. <br>
  <br>
  <b>7. Practice the Safe Step Method.</b> Don&#8217;t risk anything. This is 
  simple. If it&#8217;s not a sure thing, then don&#8217;t waste your time. And 
  besides, risk is way over-rated. <br>
  <br>
  <b>8. Look backwards.</b> Determine goals and outcome based on what has happened 
  in your life in the past. A new motto to repeat when you get a tad visionary: 
  If it hasn&#8217;t happened yet, it ain&#8217;t going to.<br>
  <b><br>
  9. Polarize your possibilities: Make either/or choices.</b> Here&#8217;s an 
  old favorite: &#8220;I can be an artist or earn a living.&#8221; Practice pitting 
  possibilities up against each other. And if you get tired of this, see your 
  options as dependent on some future success: &#8220;I can do my life&#8217;s 
  work when I win the lottery.&#8221; <br>
  <b><br>
  10. Commit and move back.</b> As soon as you commit, immediately decide you 
  need to do something different, like work at a dead-end job. At that point, 
  go back to #1: Trust your fears.<br>
