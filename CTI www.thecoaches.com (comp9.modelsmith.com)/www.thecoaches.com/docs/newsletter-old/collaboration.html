<h1>Coach &amp; Psychotherapist Collaborate </h1>
<p>Coaches and psychotherapists are change agents, yet each discipline has a different philosophy and approach. For mental health, counseling and coaching professionals, learning about and appreciating distinctions between the two fields facilitates a better result for client or patient. The following is a discussion of the more prominent distinctions between coaching and psychotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy. </strong>In Co-Active coaching, the primary assumption is that clients are emotionally healthy and have the means within themselves to obtain answers that will propel them forward, though they might feel stuck or unsure of the <em>steps to take</em> to accomplish their goals. Patients in therapy are suffering from <em>symptoms,</em> such as anxiety or depression, or have family, work and social problems that interfere with their daily lives. They usually are given a DSM-IV diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Population.</strong> A client consults a coach with a wish to achieve his or her <em>potential</em> and might say, &ldquo;Help me figure out how to change my career, enrich my relationships, spend my free time in a more satisfying way. How do I get there?&rdquo; A patient comes to a therapist with a <em>symptom</em> and might say, &ldquo;Help me eliminate the symptom so I can <em>feel</em> better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Focus.</strong> Coaching asks questions of &ldquo;<em>how to</em>&rdquo; whereas therapy more often tends to ask questions of<em> &ldquo;why</em>.&rdquo; Coaching examines lessons learned along the path to achievement. It is a forward-moving, action-based endeavor. Setting clear goals and strategizing for measurable results is the framework for the coaching partnership, as compared to therapy, where feelings, thoughts and self-exploration of coping mechanisms, and internal conflicts assume more of the focus.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitation. </strong>In the coaching relationship, activities such as brainstorming, list-generating and mutual problem-solving are used to help facilitate the client&rsquo;s agenda. The coach is not slated as the expert who diagnoses pathology, but rather the partner who has the skills to help facilitate the client&rsquo;s achievement of life goals. The coach&rsquo;s role is to assist <em>in planning the steps</em> <em>toward change</em>. The collaborative effort of the coach and client make for a partnership or a <em>structured friendship.</em> The psychotherapist serves as a <em>catalyst</em> in the change process and tends to provide an <em>environment conducive to internal change</em>, whereas in a coaching partnership, the client is already believed to be in a state of readiness for transformation. </p>
<p><strong>Homework/Fieldwork. </strong>At the close of each coaching session, the coach and client agree on a pertinent assignment that will help the client move closer to his or her goals. Sometimes, the homework is a formal assignment that is to be done by the client by a mutually decided date, whereas at other times, the assignment is simply a question (called an &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo;) on which he or she is to focus and observe in order to help remove a block or gain greater understanding. Although a therapist might ask a patient to think about a certain issue and, in some cases, suggest a homework assignment, the therapist does not consistently offer assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability. </strong>Coaches hold clients accountable for their homework/fieldwork, which is tracked or turned in as a means of measuring progress. The following questions are at the heart of coaching<em>: Where are you now? Where do you want to be? How are you going to get there? How will we know you did it?&nbsp; What did you learn along the way</em>? A discussion of what is learned is integral for deepening the experience and providing opportunity for lasting change. Although some psychotherapists may be directive in their approach, most tend not to focus on accountability as the main thrust of the change process.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance. </strong>Because coaching is more of a <em>desire </em>and psychotherapy is more of a <em>need</em>, coaching is not covered by insurance. Coaching can be deducted as a <em>business</em> expense, whereas therapy is often reimbursed or deductible as a <em>medical</em> expense.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals. </strong>Coaches would be likely to refer clients to a therapist when there are pathological patterns observed. If unhealthy patterns of behavior, which could be harmful to themselves or others, become prominent, coaches will refer clients for psychotherapy. When patients arrive at a healthier place in their lives and become emotionally ready to take more <em>action</em> toward changing their future, their therapists might refer them to a coach. Without compromising the psychotherapeutic work, the coach will help them move toward their life goals using a structured, directive and life-enhancing approach. </p>
<p><strong>Collaboration. </strong>The best treatment decision as to whether coaching, therapy or both are indicated is determined on a case-by-case basis, and is in the service of each person&rsquo;s needs, health and well-being. Here are some considerations:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a client continually breaks down crying out of nowhere, he or she might be a better candidate for psychotherapy than coaching. However, if he or she is functioning at a high level, but in a mildly depressed state, coach and client may mutually decide that both coaching and therapy would be the best fit.</li>
  <li>If the patient has been progressing in therapy, having worked through his or her dysfunctional coping mechanisms, and is presently symptom-free, the patient may be prepared to end therapy. Or, this might be the time to change the focus from internal conflicts to specific goals for external change. Patient and therapist may decide to seek a coach&rsquo;s guidance to help break through resistance or difficulty in making change. The patient may terminate therapy and further his or her personal growth in collaboration with a coach or may participate in both methodologies simultaneously. </li>
  <li>If both coaching and psychotherapy are conducted within the same time period, the coaching experience may provide more data for the psychotherapeutic process, as the snags the client experiences may be brought back into the therapy session for further enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alliance.&nbsp; </strong>In order for coaches and therapists to mutually work with a client or patient, both professionals must create a strong and comfortable alliance. Consider the following process that might occur for any one person seeking help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He or she is informed of the collaborative effort and is assured that although coach and therapist will review psychological history, as well as coaching interactions, his or her over all confidentiality will be maintained. A disclosure of information form needs to be signed.</li>
  <li>The professional who makes the referral shares treatment history or coaching history with the other professional. For example, if the therapist refers a seemingly motivated person, but one who has a long history of passivity and fear of change, it would be pertinent to inform the coach before the first client meeting.</li>
  <li>To maintain clarity, the professionals identify the mutually discussed objectives. For example, the patient might seek help from the therapist for overcoming his resistance to change while working with the coach to seek out new employment. </li>
  <li>Regularly scheduled phone consultations between coach and therapist are set up to address some of the following questions: <em>How is the client/patient responding to the coaching and therapy? Do we have any suggestions for each other?</em> For example, the therapist might inform the coach that the patient needs an emotional boost and extra support as he/she approaches a turning point. <em>Should we proceed in a different direction with the client?</em> For example, the coach might be planning to turn up the intensity to help drive the client toward more action while the therapist would concentrate on the emotions evoked as the client/patient is being challenged in new ways.</li>
  <li>Coach and therapist maintain ongoing evaluation of the alliance. <em>How are we doing? Are we getting in each other&rsquo;s way? Are we enhancing the process for the client? How can we improve? Is he or she progressing in each session, or is it time to take a break from one or the other? Is he or she ready to end the coaching, therapy or both?</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Coaches and psychotherapists work independently and in partnership, based on the needs and motivations of the client/patient. It is important that both coaches and therapists have an understanding of the target areas of help so that candidates seeking help enjoy the best possible benefit.<strong></strong></p>
