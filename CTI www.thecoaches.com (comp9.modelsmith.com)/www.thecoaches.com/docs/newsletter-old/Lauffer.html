<h1 align="left"><strong>On Being a CPCC, by a CPCC-to-Be</strong></h1>
<p>I am certifiable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My friends would say that has always been true, but now that  I stand on the brink of my CPCC certification, I state it with pride. I&rsquo;ve  completed my CTI courses and certification pod calls, survived supervisions and  coached clients for over 100 hours. All I have to do is take&mdash;and pass&mdash;&ldquo;The  Exam,&rdquo; and I will be Lisa Lauffer, CPCC.</p>
<p>Why have I chosen this path, sacrificed the hours and energy  when it isn&rsquo;t required? I did it for the same reason our clients come to us for  life coaching: I wanted more&mdash;more for my clients, my profession and myself.</p>
<p><strong>I did it for my  clients.</strong> <br />
  I believe I have a gift for life coaching, and I know that  gifts require honing. During my CTI training, I interacted with certified coaches  and CPCCs-in-training, and I could tell the difference between what I could  offer my clients and what I saw these life coaches offering. Even a casual  conversation with these folks was different. I craved the rigor that would  result in the ease and confidence these coaches possessed as they danced with  their clients, using the right skill at the right time. I wanted to tap more  into my curiosity and intuition. I wanted to listen to the words, the silences  and the environment, and ask powerful questions to forward the client&rsquo;s action  and deepen his/her learning.</p>
<p>What do I know now that I wish I had known when I started  this process? I wish I had known that the journey is the destination&mdash;that the  moment-by-moment learning was the compelling way toward achieving my  certification goal. As well, I wish I had gone with the flow more instead of  energizing myself through adrenalin and saboteur-ridden conversations in my  head. &ldquo;Flow&rdquo; coaching is less about me as a certification candidate and more  about the client. As I prepare for my exam, releasing the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; goal of  passing it and remembering that <em>all</em> coaching is about serving the client (even when the client is an examiner  evaluating me), then the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; goal melts away (how proud my coach will be  to read this).</p>
<p><strong>I did it for my  profession.</strong><br />
  Somewhere along my certification journey, pursuing  certification became partly about contributing to the life coaching profession.  I developed a sense of myself as a member of a community, as opposed to one  individual on a headset phone in her home office.<br />
  Life coaching is a young profession, one that is making its  mark on the world. I want to represent life coaching for what it can be. I  believe pursuing and achieving the highest levels of training and community-sanctioned  standards meets that goal.</p>
<p>Last week, I bumped into an acquaintance. We each shared  where our life journeys were taking us, and I told her I had become a life  coach. She had never heard of life coaching before. I described my work to her  and shared that I was finishing my certification. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  certification!&rdquo; She seemed to instantaneously give more credence to this  profession she had only just discovered. She asked questions about it, and may  even become a client. I rediscovered in that moment that, because life coaching  is young, we often have to describe to others what a life coach is and does.  When we can tell the general public that we have chosen to regulate ourselves,  that we have standards we expect our colleagues to attain and keep, we  contribute to the legitimacy of our profession. When we choose to undergo  certification even though it&rsquo;s not required, we add to that legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>I did it for myself.</strong><br />
  I pursued my CPCC because I wanted to challenge myself to a  level of rigor personally and professionally. I believe in Co-Active coaching,  and I wanted the principles, contexts, cornerstones and skills to saturate my  being. I craved the groundedness, ease, confidence and sheer bliss I saw in  certified coaches as people and professionals.</p>
<p>Have I enjoyed the process along the way? At this moment, I  shout YES! At times during the process, I said no, mostly because I had to face  myself. Oh, the blunders I made on some of those supervision tapes! And oh, the  brilliance, too. I had to face how good I am as a coach and sometimes found  that harder than looking at my failures. Acknowledge myself? Are you kidding?  And yet so vital to owning that I <em>be</em> life coaching.</p>
<p>At this moment, I look down the mountain I have scaled.  Every moment has felt like a rite of passage: gaining enough clients to enroll  in the certification program, beginning the program, reaching the mid-program  review and choosing how I&rsquo;d be for the rest of the course, having my first and  my last supervisions with each of my three supervisors, completing the course,  logging my 100th hour of coaching, and finally sending in all my  paperwork. I imagine receiving notification that I&rsquo;ve passed the exam will feel  like a rite of passage, too. Each marker along the trail has brought me closer  to the certification goal and has even more deeply imprinted on my soul what  was already there: the label &ldquo;life coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I look forward to the day (soon, I hope&mdash;wink, wink, nudge,  nudge to my examiners, whoever you may be) when I can settle into a new state of  being as CPCC. I imagine I&rsquo;ll be able to focus freed-up energy on my clients  and my practice, creating structures that will empower me to serve my clients  better. I look forward to continuing my professional development&mdash;to pursuing  training that will further empower me to develop my niches with artists, moms  and spiritual seekers. I feel energized by continuing to educate people as to  what life coaching is, and to interacting with the community that develops this  profession. And I anticipate gaining more hours and training to achieve higher  levels of certification. I dream of the day when I can put MCC behind my CPCC!</p>
