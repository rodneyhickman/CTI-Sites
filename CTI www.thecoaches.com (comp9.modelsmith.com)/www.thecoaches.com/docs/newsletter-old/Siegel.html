<h1><strong>Somatics  and Coaching&mdash;A Natural Partnership</strong></h1>
  <p>What got me excited about enhancing  my career as a somatic (body-energy based) therapist with life coaching was the  enthusiastic response from friends taking CTI courses: &ldquo;Coaching is an energy  booster!&rdquo; &ldquo;Coaching opens your energy to do things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;Energy,&rdquo; as the poet William Blake  wrote, &ldquo;is eternal delight&rdquo;&mdash;exactly what I enjoy helping to bring forth with  the people who see me for somatic therapy.

  <p>In my experience, the common ground  between somatics and coaching that makes them such natural partners is their  experiential quality and focus on energetic and intuitive awareness. Somatics  is the process of becoming aware of oneself through attention to the  ever-changing energetic patterns of the body; coaching helps people activate  and direct their life energy to achieve their goals. Both are rooted in the  critical quality of the &ldquo;felt&rdquo; sense in making decisions&mdash;the ability to feel  success, joy and connection in relationships. It is only when you can feel the  reverberations of your choices and decisions that you can know whether you&rsquo;re  on the right path for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, one of my coaching  clients in her mid-40&rsquo;s came to see me specifically for issues around what to  do to create and actualize a new career goal. Anne is very aware of herself in  her body, and particularly concerned about a lack of energy she feels whenever  she tries to take action. Just talking about trying to do so causes a drooping  in her posture and a lethargic, hopeless tone to her voice. </p>
<p>At the same time, she is an active  person who is most inspired by physical challenges. Major peak experiences for  her were hiking by herself in the Sierras and the natural birth of her son&mdash;&ldquo;the  first time in my life that I felt powerful and supported.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As I had Anne visualize herself in  the midst of these activities, she could feel the flow of energy throughout her  body and the joy this sensation produced. Her face radiated light and  happiness. Her voice resonated with conviction and connection to her spirit.  Envisioning the energetic sense of past, present and potential experiences is a  potent somatic tool that Co-Active life coaching uses to evoke a client&rsquo;s  authentic possibilities and open the pathway towards fulfillment.</p>
<p>So why has Anne been losing energy  trying on her own to find her path? She has encountered her Saboteur, which  Co-Active Coaching recognizes as the fear-shadow blocking the path to personal  growth and change. In Anne&rsquo;s case, her Saboteur likes to keep her safe by not  allowing her to test her capabilities. Its energetic quality is lethargy, a  drugged kind of numbness permeating her whole body and suffocating her  feelings. In the grip of her Saboteur, she can make no effort and takes no  risks. </p>
<p>In her decision to try coaching,  Anne has reached out for support in taking action to change her life. In our  sessions together, I have guided her through what has been a complex stage of  creating perspectives around the topic of a new career goal. This Co-Active  somatic coaching experience has presented Anne with a diverse range of new  inner geographies, each perspective having its own landscape with its own felt  quality and energy. Her perspectives have included &ldquo;Stuck,&rdquo; &ldquo;There Are  Possibilities,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Excited (with Fear).&rdquo; In a major challenge to her  Saboteur, Anne has chosen to take the perspective of &ldquo;Excited (with Fear)&rdquo;  because that is the landscape where she most clearly feels her energy and where  she feels drawn to explore. This is not the terrain where she feels most  comfortable or grounded in her body. However, in encouraging her to be with the  discomfort&mdash;supporting her in knowing that she can sit with a diverse mixture of  felt experiences, including enthusiasm, fear, vertigo, guilt, desire&mdash;Anne is  increasingly able to sense the richness of her choice. It is the place where  her love of a physical and spiritual challenge is most free to manifest, and  where her intuition flourishes.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s work with me is still in the  early stages. In looking at her progress during our sessions together, though,  I see clearly how infused the whole process of Co-Active life coaching is with  that of somatic awareness. This powerful combination allows us as coaches to  help our clients bring together body, mind and spirit to awaken the deep, inner  energetic resources that can&mdash;and do&mdash;change their lives.</p>
