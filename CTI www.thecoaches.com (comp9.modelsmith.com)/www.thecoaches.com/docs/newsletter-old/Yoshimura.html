<h1> <strong>Serving up Emotional Intelligence</strong> </h1>
<p>As I was mulling over how to approach this article, I received an e-mail from a client. Attached was a sound file named &ldquo;911 tape.&rdquo; Grateful for the distraction, I immediately opened it.</p>
<p>It was an audio recording of a woman calling 911 from the drive-through at a Burger King. She wanted the 911 operator to send down an officer to force Burger King to make her Western BBQ Burger correctly. According to the woman, she had her kids in the car and they were hungry right after Tae Kwan Do practice, and she was about to jump onto the toll way&mdash;she really needed this burger! The staff kept giving her the wrong burger, and she kept insisting they make it correctly. Burger King asked her if she wanted her money back and she refused&mdash;she wanted her burger.</p>
<p>The 911 operator told her to act like an adult, and calmly and rationally work this out with the manager. The woman said the manager wasn&rsquo;t acting like an adult. The operator refused to send down an officer and the woman demanded that the police come there to &ldquo;protect her.&rdquo; The operator replied, &ldquo;From what? The wrong hamburger? A harmful hamburger?&rdquo; The operator put her foot down and told Hungry Mama to calmly and rationally talk to the manager, get her money back and go somewhere else.</p>
<p>As coaches, we know the woman wasn&rsquo;t really angry about a basic hamburger being passed off as a Western BBQ Burger. There are probably a lot of places we could have coached her&mdash;or could we have helped in this situation? Based on her tone and inability to see alternate solutions, Hungry Mama sounded like she was flooded. She saw only one solution, and that was to get her hamburger done the way she wanted.</p>
<p>When we get angry, our blood pressure shoots up and the body does some amazing things. First, the adrenal glands pump out adrenaline, then the heart rate jumps up as much as 20 beats a minute in a single second, and then blood gets shunted from the thinking part of the brain and gets diverted to muscles like legs and arms. Once this happens, we&rsquo;re primed to fight or take flight. Sometimes this comes in handy, say, when being attacked by a saber-tooth tiger. And, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t, like when we get the wrong hamburger. </p>
<p>Even though human beings today have advanced brain circuitry that allows them to plan, solve problems, and organize and rationalize, underneath this elaborate maze lies ancient wiring called the limbic system. Also known as the emotional brain, this is the part of the brain responsible for passion, determination and desire&mdash;the juice that brings planning alive. We need emotions to survive. Fear keeps us safe from harmful situations. Love allows us to bond and reproduce. However, sometimes the emotional center of the brain doesn&rsquo;t send the right information and we might find ourselves overreacting to benign situations. The adage &ldquo;leave your emotions at the door&rdquo; when coming to work is impossible&mdash;everything we see and hear gets evaluated by the emotional center before it gets sent to the thinking part of our brain. </p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is about becoming attuned to your emotions and the emotions of others, and using this information to increase happiness and harmony within yourself and your relationships. It&rsquo;s about learning new ways to recover when life hands you the wrong hamburger. Hungry Mama only saw one solution to her predicament. She wanted her hamburger and if she wasn&rsquo;t going to get it, she was going to resort to force&mdash;the police force&mdash;to get her way. Most of us probably would have gotten angry and driven off, or just accepted the wrong hamburger because we were hungry. However, I can see how HM got triggered. Being a parent is like having a whole Pandora&rsquo;s box of emotions in itself. If my son really wanted something, I can see how my motherly instinct to give him what he wants would override rational thinking. HM wasn&rsquo;t aware of her emotional triggers. One of her values could have been good customer service, and it was being squashed. Maybe her inner critic was telling her she was a bad mom if she couldn&rsquo;t get her kids what they wanted. And because she wasn&rsquo;t self-managed, her ability to assess what could have been going on with the people at Burger King was clouded. Thus, she communicated her feelings in a manner that probably stirred up more conflict.</p>
<p>This is just a snapshot of possibilities that occurred at the drive-up window. Who knows what could have happened an hour before? The thing about stress is, these chemicals stay in your body for hours and build upon one another. Add in angry or negative thoughts, and more chemicals are coursing through the body. They actually alter the way we &ldquo;see&rdquo; situations. Emotional Intelligence is also being aware of what&rsquo;s going on in your body. New research shows that 95% of our decisions, emotions, behavior and actions are unconscious. How many times have I driven home from the office and couldn&rsquo;t recall the drive? Yet, even though the brain doesn&rsquo;t register something, the body does. Ever have a feeling that something is out of place but can&rsquo;t put your finger on what it is?</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence, like Co-Active coaching, is about bringing the unconscious to the conscious. In fulfillment coaching, we work with clients to uncover their core values and tame the voice of the inner critic, and these two things increase self-awareness substantially. Helping clients see different perspectives and turn obstacles into opportunities is central to both self-management and balance coaching. Emotional Intelligence skills are skills that can easily be learned and improved. They can be a foundation for powerful coaching and a valuable skill that can enhance coaching at every level.</p>
