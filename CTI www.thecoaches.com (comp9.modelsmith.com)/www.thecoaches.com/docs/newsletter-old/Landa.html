<h1 align="left" style="margin-top:0;"><strong>The Way of Serenity&mdash;Coaching Beyond Technique</strong></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I had recently received an email from my martial arts teacher with a blurb about serenity&mdash;which really got me thinking. What is serenity? And perhaps more importantly&mdash;what meaning, value or importance does serenity have in my personal life and in my life as a coach? Some of my answers are laid out before you in this article, in the hope that you may draw some benefit from them, both in your personal lives and also in your professional lives as coaches. Enjoy!</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Serenity: a) a disposition free from stress or emotion [syn: repose, quiet, placidity, tranquility]; b) the absence of mental stress or anxiety [syn: peace, peacefulness, peace of mind, repose, heart&rsquo;s ease]. The first thing that strikes me about these two definitions of serenity is how essential they are for truly powerful coaching to take place. The skills and techniques of coaching can be described as the <em>doing </em>aspect of coaching. And then there is the <em>being </em>aspect of coaching&mdash;the place where the <em>doing </em>comes from. There can be little doubt that serenity speaks to the <em>being </em>aspect of coaching.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In my opinion, the degree to which a coach has gained freedom from his/her own emotions, mental stress and anxieties (being in touch with serenity) is the degree to which a coach has attained the ability to see things clearly and take purposeful action. Furthermore, the degree to which coaches have gained the ability to see things clearly and take action is the degree to which they can help their clients achieve clarity and purposeful action within their own lives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The second thing that strikes me about these definitions of serenity is how apparently contradictory the state of serenity seems to be with &quot;reality&quot; as we know it. Our world, as we know it, is full of emotions, mental stress and anxieties. Our world is full of daily dramas and pressing issues, important agendas and people to meet. Where does serenity fit in with all of this? How can such an &ldquo;other-worldly&rdquo; quality such as serenity be harnessed by coaches in service of their clients and their &ldquo;real world&rdquo; problems? How can clients embrace serenity within their own hectic, anxiety-inducing and action-filled lives?</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">There are many techniques that people can use to &ldquo;become&rdquo; more serene (e.g., yoga, meditation, art, walking in nature, etc.), but I will not be discussing them in this article. What I want to offer is a fresh way in which to <em>view</em> serenity&mdash;a way that has the potential to empower coaches and clients alike towards a greater and deeper appreciation and experience of serenity within their lives. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">First of all, I would like to suggest that serenity is not something that stands in opposition to our everyday reality and that it can be cultivated within the midst of the most non-serene circumstances you might be able to imagine. I am aware of the fact that many people share this belief, and when asked about this issue, would definitely agree that this is the case&mdash;that one need not escape to the mountaintops to cultivate and achieve a deeper understanding of serenity. Nonetheless, not everyone can relate to this viewpoint, and even those who can, usually appreciate any re-enforcements they can get! Thus, I would like to elaborate shortly on this point using the example of the martial arts.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The martial arts are powerful examples of disciplines that embody the paradox of serenity in the midst of chaos and/or violence. Their ideal exemplifies the proverbial &quot;lotus in the fire,&quot; when confronted with extreme challenge. By confronting violence (I am using violence here as a symbol for an extreme challenge) on a regular basis and not shying away from it, the martial artist finds himself in face-to-face encounters&nbsp; (surprisingly enough) with serenity as well. It's almost as if serenity and challenge are two sides of the same coin. They are opposites that attract each other; they are two ends of one stick. When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other with it.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Hence, stealing this martial arts lesson and applying it to the context of every day life shows us that the challenges and hassles that are inherent in the lives of us all, contain the seeds of serenity within them. They are gifts that provide us the opportunity to experience serenity within our lives. In a reality without challenges, annoyances, imperfections, etc., there would be no context within which we could get in touch with the marvel of serenity. This is, in part, the miracle and wonder of reality as we know it.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The second aspect of serenity that I would like to highlight is that serenity is not a subjective emotional state like anger, sadness, happiness or joy. As its definition implies, serenity actually makes its presence known in the conspicuous lack of subjective emotional states. It is defined as a disposition that is free of mental stress, emotion and anxiety (i.e., it seems to be defined more easily by what it is not, than by what it is).</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">I would venture to say that serenity is actually the fabric of our existing reality. It is the fabric upon which the dramas of our lives unfold. When we are in nature we can get a sense of the ever-present serenity that is humming in the background. The swaying trees on a beautiful spring day seem to be caressed by some ungraspable essence that is assuring in its presence but elusive in its form and definition. Even within the most violent of storms (a tornado), there is the serenity of the &quot;eye of the storm.&quot; Serenity is truly an ever-present element of our reality.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Viewed in this light, serenity is not something to develop within ourselves, or to add to ourselves. Rather, it is something that we need to allow ourselves to get in touch with. Serenity is always here for us. It is all around us, and it is within us as well. It envelops our bodies, as it envelops everything within our physical existence&mdash;and all we need to do is to acknowledge it within our own experience to connect with it.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">So next time a client is struggling with a challenge and/or issue in their lives, ask him/her to uncover the gift within it. It might just be a golden opportunity to experience a dose of serenity in the client&rsquo;s life. For coaches: What if we viewed the challenges of building a successful coaching practice as golden opportunities for us to increasingly get in touch with serenity? What benefits would this hold for our clients as we develop our practice, and not only become more successful coaches, but also more serene and accepting of the challenges we face? Serenity is out there&mdash;only you can decide whether you choose to experience it or not.</p>
