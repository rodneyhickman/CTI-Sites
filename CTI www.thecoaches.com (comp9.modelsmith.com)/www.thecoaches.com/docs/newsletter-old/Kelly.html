<h1><strong>Blast Off With Your Business Vision!</strong></h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2><strong>What impact has visioning had on your clients/yourself? </strong></h2>
<p>As coaches, we work with clients to help them develop a  fulfilling vision for their life and take action to make their vision a  reality. It&rsquo;s ironic that often we neglect to create a vision for our own  lives&mdash;especially the life of our business. Do you have a vision for your  business a year from now? Two years? Just as you benefit from having a personal  vision, so too will you benefit from having a business vision.</p>
<p>A compelling and  engaging business vision will provide you with two key ingredients for business  success: direction and motivation. </p>
<p>Many small businesses don&rsquo;t have a firm vision so they  tend to wander, moving from this to that without any plan, strategy or  accountability. It&rsquo;s a situation ripe for de-motivation, frustration and  business failure. Having a vision will allow you to set a direction for your  business and is the first step in developing an achievable business plan. You  will feel more focused and empowered. </p>
<p>In addition, a vision  will help you stay motivated to take subsequent action steps even when they  aren&rsquo;t enjoyable or comfortable. Without the foundation of an engaging vision  to fire you up, many of the activities may seem hollow. The business vision is  what provides the &quot;fuel&quot; to propel you into action so that you will  be more productive and willing to step into new adventures. </p>
<p>I can guarantee that  crafting a meaningful business vision will have a positive impact on your  business success! Personally, my business really took off once I had a  compelling business vision that I felt passionate about and engaged by.  Suddenly, the rest of the work seemed to flow much more easily. Now, whenever  my work seems to take too much effort, I know it's time to revisit my vision  and get another &quot;fill-up&quot; of rocket fuel. My business vision shows me  where I&rsquo;m headed, helps me appreciate and acknowledge my progress, and also  helps me stay motivated in the lean, scary or not-so-fun times. </p>
<h2><strong>What visioning tools do you use? </strong></h2>
<p>In my own experience with entrepreneurs (including  myself), I&rsquo;ve learned that visions can take time to percolate and take shape.  Three important tools in crafting a business vision are your own patience,  creativity and persistence. </p>
<p>Another &ldquo;tool&rdquo; is the  understanding of what a business vision is and is not&mdash;the tool of creating  distinctions. Some important distinctions are described below. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A business vision is the look, feel, container  (or whatever word you use) that you want for your business at a given point in  the future. It is not a business plan, which typically focuses on the  objectives, goals and action steps needed to reach the vision. However, the two  go hand-in-hand. A vision with no plan is not effective, and a plan without a  vision will feel hollow. You can think of the vision as the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the  destination and the business plan as the &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; on how to get there. </li>
  <li>The most important &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; of the vision is <strong>you</strong>, for your own motivation and  direction. It&rsquo;s not meant to be a part of your marketing. First you must have  your own vision&mdash;all yours, for you, about you, you, only you. Later, you may  choose to include aspects of your vision in your marketing, but that should not  be your perspective when crafting your vision. </li>
  <li>There is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;better&rdquo; structure or  format for a business vision. The only guideline is that it should be  documented or captured somehow so that you can revisit and refine it later. How  it&rsquo;s documented is totally up to you! It can be written or visual or  auditory&mdash;whatever form speaks to you. The most important thing is that your  vision engage your passion and grab both your heart and mind, in relation to  your business. Plus, it should be in a form that when you revisit it, you are  able to recall the essence and power of the vision. </li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some  questions I&rsquo;ve used to begin the process: </p>
<ol>
  <li>What do you feel is your mission or purpose in life? In  work? </li>
  <li>What qualities and values do you want to honor in your  business? </li>
  <li>What personal characteristics do you want to expand/enlarge  through your business? </li>
  <li>What kind of work really excites you, and how do you want to  incorporate that into your business? </li>
  <li>What is a metaphor, object, piece of music or art, body  movement, or description that speaks to you or helps you feel the way you want  your business to feel? </li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>What structures do you use to keep the vision alive?</strong></h2>
<p>For your vision to be of any use to you, it must be kept  alive and evolving. Just as we evolve as humans, so too do our visions and  dreams. Just like your life vision, a business vision is always a work in  process. </p>
<p>I revisit and  refine/revise my vision at least once a year. It&rsquo;s on my calendar as part of my  &ldquo;end of year&rdquo; process, along with a review/revision of my Q4 business plan. </p>
<p>In addition, I am  frequently touching in with my vision throughout the year. I revisit my vision  to get motivation when I&rsquo;m in a lean period or a time where I am faced with  challenges or tasks that I don&rsquo;t enjoy. I also use my vision as a guidepost  when I am making a major decision: which choice will bring me closer to my  vision? </p>
<p>My vision is in  written form and also in a collage form. I have the collage hanging in a  visible place so I can stop and admire it. It makes me smile and feel lighter.  I also have pictures and graphics around that remind me of aspects of my  vision, so in a way I am surrounded by my vision nearly all the time! </p>
<p>Experiment and find a  structure that works for you so that you can take full advantage of your  vision&rsquo;s ability to motivate you and provide direction and focus. Stay open and  playful with new elements as they emerge in your life, heart and mind. Let your  vision breathe and evolve. </p>
