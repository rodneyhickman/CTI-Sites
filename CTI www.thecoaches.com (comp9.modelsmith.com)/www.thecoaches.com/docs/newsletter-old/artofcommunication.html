<h1> The Art of Communication</h1>
<p>You&#8217;re on the way to the airport. You get on the plane with a book that 
  you&#8217;ve been planning to read for quite some time. As you open your book, 
  you glance at the person next to you. A few minutes later, the person next to 
  you asks you a question and you reluctantly answer. You lower your book a bit 
  to be polite and after a few minutes, you find yourself putting your book down 
  and engaging in a conversation, although with a lack of enthusiasm. <br>
  <br>
  And then the person next to you, let&#8217;s call him John, makes an observation 
  about you that&#8217;s quite perceptive and sensitive. You start to become curious 
  about John and who he is. In the course of the conversation, he tells you of 
  an experience he has only shared with a few people. You let John know that you 
  have had the same experience. <br>
  <br>
  By now you&#8217;re totally engaged and listening to John&#8217;s next words 
  and closely watching for every nuance in the inflection of his voice and in 
  the way he moves. Time seems to stand still and the next thing you know, the 
  plane lands. You say goodbye and go on your way. You&#8217;re feeling empowered 
  and feel that you were just with a kindred soul. The next day, you receive an 
  email from John acknowledging your greatness, and you respond. <br>
  <br>
  We would all love to have these experiences more often. We feel heard and everything 
  seems possible. It is communication at its highest level. But unfortunately, 
  it&#8217;s a lost art! <br>
  <br>
  <i>&#8220;Too many of us have lost touch with the fire of conversation. When 
  we talk together, it is rarely with depth. For the most part, we see our conversations 
  as either opportunities to trade information or opportunities to win points. 
  Difficulties that might otherwise be resolved or even dissolved persist. And 
  often we find we simply do not have the wherewithal to genuinely consider new 
  possibilities, new options. Such miscommunication or misunderstanding condemns 
  us to look elsewhere for the creative intensity that lies dormant within and 
  between us. Yet it is an intensity that could revitalize our institutions, our 
  relationships and ourselves.&quot;</i><br>

  <br>
  By making &#8220;connection&#8221; a priority and necessity, we can transform 
  our communication. We must recognize that what we all want on a deeper level 
  is the ability to connect with another, to touch each other&#8217;s soul. Using 
  the right words is a good start, but until you have the intention and willingness 
  to master the art of communication, it won&#8217;t happen. <br>
  <br>
  Communication is the gateway to a more fulfilling life and a better world. Imagine 
  living in a world where we truly listen to each other. Listening is about caring 
  and being in the moment. As we expand our ability to focus and be present, we 
  become more available to others. Listening is about flowing and being in the 
  rhythm of life. Listening is about being on the journey of life and sharing 
  who we are and what we feel. <br>
