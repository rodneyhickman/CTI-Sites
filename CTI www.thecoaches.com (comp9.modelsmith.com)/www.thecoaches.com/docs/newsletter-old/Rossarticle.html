                                                    Last year, I flew from Denver to San Francisco to take my coaching Certification Exam. After completing a six-month program, this was the final step of getting the CPCC credential&mdash;a written exam followed by two 12-minute coaching sessions in front of examiners and video camera alike. Time to put up or shut up. While the focus and worry for my classmates had been on the oral exam&mdash;coaching live in front of experienced coaching instructors&mdash;I was more concerned with making arrangements to see friends and family in the Bay Area. Instead of wondering if I would be able to ask the right powerful question during the oral exam, I was figuring out how to get to four different suburbs without a car. Misplaced attention? Not really.

<p>Thinking back on the CTI Certification Program, I realize that it is more than a process. It is an environment. Through weekly calls with &ldquo;pod-mates,&rdquo; I became immersed in the &ldquo;being&rdquo; of coaching&mdash;what it feels like to coach well, how my thoughts and beliefs influence my coaching, and how the unspoken is always trying to emerge. Through regular homework, I noticed my reaction to each assignment. Some assignments pulled me into a topic that I wanted to explore further; others struck me as stupid from the get go, and still others challenged my beliefs. Sometimes, it wasn&rsquo;t the assigned topic that I reacted to, but rather just having the assignment. I remember at the third homework assignment hating the feeling of being back in graduate school, and confessing all of this to my pod-mates on our weekly call. The good thing about the coaching profession is that nothing gets stepped over and everything is fodder for coaching. I was promptly coached by the rest of the group. Why was I in the Certification Program? What did it feel like to be back in graduate school? What rules did I make up about doing homework? The Certification Program became a framework for me to notice myself, with my pod-mates and pod leader as witnesses. &nbsp;

<p>The Certification Program also led me to a place of seeing myself without ego, a place where I could step outside of Me and see what I looked like, without judgment. When I was a young engineer, I took a class on giving effective presentations. I remember watching myself on videotape. It was painful. In retrospect I&rsquo;m not sure I was all that bad. In fact, I could have been quite good for all I remember. I couldn&rsquo;t stand to see myself from the camera&rsquo;s viewpoint without thinking, &ldquo;Who is that woman? I don&rsquo;t know who she is.&rdquo; My ego was so fragile that I couldn&rsquo;t get past the &ldquo;who&rdquo; to see the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; Now many years later, certification required me to tape client calls and review them with a supervisor, an experienced coach trained to help me see what was happening in my coaching. After listening to hours of tapes of myself coaching clients, I learned to disconnect the &ldquo;who&rdquo; from the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; I focused on what was happening in the coaching and with the client, instead of on me. I looked forward to being alone in the car, so I could play tapes and pick up something new in the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; Then, after the supervisor reviewed a tape with me, I reconnected Me to the coaching. With each supervision call, I found out something new about myself&mdash;where I was afraid to go with clients, what I selectively listened to and didn&rsquo;t listen to, what my natural strengths were. This process of disconnecting and then reconnecting made me comfortable in my own skin.

<p>Certification not only made me a better coach; I have become a better person, too. I learned to have more compassion for the human condition, to take a fierce stand for what&rsquo;s important, to be unabashedly genuine about my own fallibility and ignorance, to accept what is without judgment. Thomas Leonard, a prime mover in creating the coaching discipline, said shortly before his untimely death, <em><span style="color:black;">&quot;Great coaching is not really about coaching skills, competencies or even proficiencies. It's about being a great person. Great people make great coaches.&quot;</span></em><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;(Thanks to Coachville and Dave Buck for this wonderful quote.)&nbsp; </span> &nbsp;

<p><span style="color:black;">So along with working out the logistics of my trip to California, the preparation for the exam took the form of being the better person that I had become. I knew everything I needed to know for the exam. I only needed to be&mdash;to show up fully. The preparation for the exam moment, under the scrutiny of strangers with clipboards, had started a long time ago&mdash;even before I began coaching training. It started when I realized that compassion was essential to being a whole person. It started when I journaled during a personal development workshop many years ago and discovered that it was important for me to speak about what I see. And yes, it started when I forgave my dead father for his volatile temper and the long shadow that it cast on the entire household as I was growing up. All of these things have made me the person that I am today. </span> &nbsp; </p>
<p>We prepare for our finest moments many years in advance. What we are truly preparing for, we have no idea at the time. We only know that we are living our lives. <span style="color:black;">When we realize we are good to go, just as we are, stepping forward becomes more than possible. It becomes how we live. No more preparation is needed to join the game of life. You come with what you have&mdash;to the bone, to the core. No more is needed. </span> &nbsp;
