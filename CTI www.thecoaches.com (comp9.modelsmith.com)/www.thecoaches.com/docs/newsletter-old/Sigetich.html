<h1>Play to Their Strengths</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Did you know that Lance  Armstrong began his sports career as a tri-athlete? Prior to becoming the  world&rsquo;s premiere cyclist, Lance spread his energy among running, swimming and  cycling. He was a good swimmer and fast on his feet as a runner, but he truly  excelled at cycling. Recognizing that biking was his strength, Lance  concentrated his efforts on cycling competitions, and the payoff is historic,  both for the world of sports and for Lance!</p>
<p>Unlike Lance, many  of our clients focus their efforts on improving and overcoming their weaknesses.  This is not only ineffective for driving sustainable personal growth, it&rsquo;s also  boring and uninspiring! Most of us were raised in the grip of society&rsquo;s myth of  well-roundedness. Early in life we learn that being well-rounded&mdash;being a little  bit good at everything&mdash;is the desirable end-state of our schooling. We&rsquo;re  taught to overcome all of our weaknesses by simply &ldquo;trying harder.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re encouraged  to practice ballet or the clarinet even if we hate it. How utterly exhausting  and frustrating! I&rsquo;m convinced that the truth of the matter is, there&rsquo;s a  better way to work with our clients. Our work isn&rsquo;t about weakness at all. It&rsquo;s  about our clients&rsquo; strengths. </p>
<p>Our strengths create  the platform from which we can excel. Our strengths fuel our passions, and  bring joy, success, fulfillment and sustainability to our work.</p>
<p>Most of us&mdash;certainly  most of my clients&mdash;have never focused on our strengths. We discount them, if we  notice them at all. For many, our strengths are the sea in which we swim&mdash;and  so, we don&rsquo;t even see them. We may be dimly aware that we sometimes overuse a  strength&mdash;say, a strength of compassion, or a strength of directness&mdash;but how  often do we really stop and assess our strengths? How often do we acknowledge  and claim them? How often do we celebrate them? For that matter, how often do  we even think about this sea of power in which we&rsquo;re swimming?</p>
<p>Shifting ourselves  and our clients to focus on their strengths is profound, tantalizing and fun  work! When we help others clearly see their strengths, we create an impact in  our clients&rsquo; lives that is next to none. When clients discover what they&rsquo;re  good at, when they understand their natural gifts, when they come to accept and  acknowledge and commit to growing and utilizing their strengths, we witness a  profound self-acceptance in our clients and release from the constraints of  &ldquo;never being good enough.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The StrengthsFinder&reg;,  presented in <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em> by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton, is the instrument I use for helping  clients assess their strengths. StrengthsFinder is rich and deep and helps create  a language around strengths not replicated in the few other instruments that  exist. I&rsquo;ve used the StrengthsFinder for three years and still marvel at the  deep acknowledgement clients give themselves when they understand their  strengths as innate, unique and intriguing gifts. Even clients who believe they  know their strengths are surprised to discover they actually know the behaviors  they excel at&mdash;not the underlying strength. </p>
<p>For example, a  senior leader in one very rational, hard-driving corporation was shocked to  discover that &ldquo;Harmony&rdquo; is one of his strengths. He&rsquo;s learned to manage and  embrace conflict, and he doesn&rsquo;t shy away from tough issues. But as we explored  the strength of Harmony, we realized that it isn&rsquo;t conflict management he is  good at&mdash;it&rsquo;s achieving the outcome of harmony among people and aligning them  with an approach, a strategy or an idea. In fact, his ability to create harmony  among disparate parties has fueled his success and draws talented people to  clamor to work for him. Because he now sees his strength in a much broader  light, he also sees many more possibilities open to him for applying his  strength!</p>
<p>Working with the  StrengthsFinder, our clients open up to bold new perspectives and many new  options. Personally, my own top strengths of Maximizer and Strategic tell me  that I excel at taking something good and turning it into something excellent,  that I can pick the right path to do this successfully, and that I quickly spot  the patterns so that I pick the right thing to transform. As you might guess,  these strengths serve me in all aspects of my life and can be applied to almost  any career, hobby, relationship, interest or passion.</p>
<p>I love the positive  relationships and expanding potential of working with my client&rsquo;s strengths!  Strengths are a powerful resource to invigorate growth and development, from the  basis of a solid understanding of the client&rsquo;s natural creativity,  resourcefulness and wholeness.</p>
<p>Inviting clients to  complete the StrengthsFinder is also very easy. They buy the book <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em> at Amazon  for $19.80. Inside the cover of the book, is a code that can be used one time  to take the StrengthsFinder instrument. This is an inexpensive way to purchase  the book and the assessment. You don&rsquo;t need any particular training or  certification to assist your clients in understanding their strengths&mdash;just the  natural curiosity and desire to learn that I know you have as a coach! And, of  course, the willingness to see strength in everyone.</p>
