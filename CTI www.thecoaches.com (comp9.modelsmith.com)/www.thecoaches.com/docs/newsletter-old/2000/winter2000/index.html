																<font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">ot long ago, I was watching a wonderful video series put together by a cosmologist named Brian Swimme called, &quot;Canticle to the Cosmos.&quot; In this series he spoke about the three principles that govern the Universe: Subjectivity, Diversity and Communion. Subjectivity is about uniqueness - everything has an identity and is whole and complete in itself Diversity is about difference - everything is different from everything else. Communion is about sharing everything is part of the same thing and shares and interacts constantly with everything else. In the coaching world we do a pretty good job living the principles of Subjectivity and Diversity. I think we are yearning for more Communion then we have.</font>
																<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">One of the magical things that occurs in our workshops is the way Communion happens along with Subjectivity and Diversity. We are all longing for the kind of intimacy created in these workshops. When we interact and share our full selves, intimacy blossoms. We realize the difference that just listening to someone can make, not to mention the impact a few dumb questions will have on the rest of our lives. When this kind of interaction is occurring frequently, people start to love themselves for the simple and profound</font></td>

That is why, over and over again, I hear in our workshops, &quot;We must be special. Surely other groups aren't this great. Does this kind of magic occur in every group?&quot; The truth is that you are special (Subjectivity), that other groups are just as great in very different ways (Diversity), and that the magic of connection and community happens in every group (Communion).</font>
																<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&nbsp; The workshop ends and we return to our lives and to this new coaching profession that we now love, and then we find that it isn't very difficult to find Diversity and Subjectivity all over the place. Communion, however, seems to be a little trickier to find. We go back to workshops, find it there, leave and then hunger for Communion back in our lives. One of the costs of becoming more successful as coaches appears to be loss of community because we become more and more isolated. Many of you have found all</font></p>
