Each two day Practicurn gives you a chance to practice... practice... practice and get lots of succinct, bottom line feedback from CTI course leaders on what's really working for you in your coaching and where you need to grow. Each course is centered around a different topic so you'll also walk away with new tools that you can begin applying in your coaching right away.</font>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">So, if you have not yet taken the Certification plunge, these Practicums are a great way to sharpen and deepen your coaching ability. If you are already certified, you will have an opportunity to tune up your skills and take your coaching to a fuller, deeper level. For those of you currently in the Certification Program, we've scheduled our Practicurns in conjunction with Certification exams because we can't think of a better way to prep for the exam.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Each Practicum is two days long, Wednesday and Thursday from 10 am - 6 pm. Tuition is $350.00 for each Practicurn or if you sign up for two or more Practicurns at one time, tuition is $300.00 each. Register early for these new courses. We expect them to fill up quickly.</font></p>
