The name of this mountain is Your Career. What will it look like at the peak? To get to the top depends largely on how well you market yourself. Here are three steps to help you reach a higher level of success.</font>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>1. Understand Your Climbing Skills</b></font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What makes you unique? The answer might be your secret for success. It could be anything from your life experience to your gift of intuition. Brainstorm! Take five minutes and write down every special thing about you. Also, ask your friends to give you their input.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">How does your uniqueness translate into superior service? In my case, my experience in extreme sports taught me ways to overcome fear. I now have methods to help other people take action and stay focused on achieving their goals. What have you learned that you can share with your clients?</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&quot;What do you do?&quot; How many times have you been asked this question? This is a golden opportunity to market your expertise. Often we reply with &quot;umm.&quot; That's perfect! Let that &quot;umm&quot; remind you to use your Unique Marketing Message (UMM). I like to respond to &quot;what do you do?&quot; with the question: &quot;Well, do you know how so many people want to be more successful in business and with their personal goals, but have a hard time taking action and staying focused?&quot; This gets the prospect curious. I follow that with my UMM: &quot;I provide the tools, the structure and the accountability to help people accomplish their most important goals. I'm a Certified Personal Coach.&quot; Your UMM will constantly evolve. just remember that it should always offer benefits.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>2. Plan Your Route</b></font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are hundreds of ways to market yourself. You could create a promo kit to send to the media and to prospects. You could speak at business groups and functions, send out monthly postcards, emails and faxes. You can also call people to say, &quot;Hi,&quot; and find out if they remember your UMM.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">No need to struggle. You can do any of these things, but you can't do all of them at the same time. The best way to avoid overwhelm and frustration is to create a marketing plan and then stick with it. Make sure that your plan is specific, measurable, attainable (with some risk), and includes goal dates and deadlines. Don't forget to look at how your own coach can be a supportive climbing partner.</font></td>

Focus on what you really want. Notice the fears that come up for you around promoting yourself. Use those fears as a friendly reminder to research what works for you and what doesn't. Follow your plan. Take action. Make it fun! Be unique! And remember to reach high!</font></p>
