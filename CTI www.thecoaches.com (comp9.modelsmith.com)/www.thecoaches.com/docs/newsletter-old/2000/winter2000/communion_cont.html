Many of you haven't.</font>
																<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Some of you are perhaps like I was, and think yourselves rugged individualists with no need for community at all. You could happily stay cooped up for days, weeks even, and never see a soul. As I look more carefully into those hermit-like times in my past, I realize I wasn't very conscious and aware. When I was conscious I felt lonely; I felt that longing for community with others. I do still seek out blissful moments of solitude or Communion with nature, leaving others of my species behind for a while. But now, I always have a community to return to that feeds me, stimulates my creativity and keeps me alive, aware and connected.</font></p>
																<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I feel an instinctive, almost global calling for a community of coactive coaches and leaders who somehow continue the magic that is started in the workshops: a community where you and I can be nourished and supported as we grow and learn together, a community founded in magnificence of all of its parts, a community that is consciously designed and strives to honor and improve that designed alliance.</font></td>
															<td valign="top" width="5" height="396"></td>
															<td valign="top" width="214" height="396"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I see the way people light up when sharing fully with each other in our workshops and I know that Communion is the next frontier for us to explore together. How do you or I make this Communion happen? How can I possibly fit it into my already overwhelmed life? Where do I find the folks for this community? These are certainly some of the questions I am asking as I write this and they stimulate many answers, most of them sourced by my Gremlin. To talk my gremlins down, I call to mind another great book, <u>A Simpler Way</u>, in which Meg Wheatley and Myron Kellnor-Rogers write about the mess. They say that creativity and new stuff comes out of the mess. The more willing we are to live with, and in fact create mess, the more likely we are to create something new and wonderful. This is how we're approaching the challenge of creating community at CTI and we hope you'll do the same. As we all leap with ungainly and sometimes graceless strides in an attempt to include Communion in our lives, we need to have the faith that out of the mess something wondrous will occur. The next frontier awaits. See you there!</font>
