Why, I wonder, in this crazy world, do people take the time to share with a friend, to email me a piece of feedback about something that isn't working, or to come and assist at the back of the room? I so appreciate this level of relationship, of participation. Clearly these people gain something themselves from giving. Still, I am awestruck by their generosity.</font>
								<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It's nothing new to say that CTI is a volunteer based organization. Much of what we have accomplished has been a result of support from out extended community. As we be in community together, organized around our commitment to coaching, we nourish and enrich each other. I do know that there is something special about the energy of CTI.</font></p>
								<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">At the heart of that difference, I feel, are the fundamental principles of Co-active Coaching; that people are naturally creative, resourceful and whole, as well as the fact that we place a high value on collaborative, designed alliances with those around us.</font></p>
								<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Also, I know that we draw to us and have in our community a very unique and special caliber of people; people who want to make a difference and who have a larger vision for what is possible in the world.</font></p>
