													experiencing dramatic growth. From senior executives at Fortune 100 companies, to the self-employed, to people in transition, people at the point of change are looking more and more to coaches for guidance and support. For professional coaches who want to increase their proficiency as well as for those interested in integrating coaching skills into their consulting practice, Co-Active Coaching presents a revolutionary new collaborative approach. Developed by three pioneers and leading authorities in the coaching field, this approach allows the client and coach to work together to identify both work-related and personal areas of development.</font></td>

This model encompasses five specific skills sets and the three key principles of coaching: fulfillment, balance and process,&quot; Fulfillment is about who we choose to be, balance is about how we shape our lives, process is about how we move through the world,&quot; say the authors.</font>
