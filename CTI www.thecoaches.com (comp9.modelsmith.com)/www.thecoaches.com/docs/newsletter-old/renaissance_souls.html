<title>How to Coach People with Many Interests</title>
<h1>How to Coach People with Many Interests </h1>

<p>
Many people confronting their next career move have difficulty pinning themselves down.  They have many interests - and selecting one direction for such people feels like putting on a straight jacket.

<p>
If you are coaching a person who has many interests, there is hope for them.  They don't have to do one thing - they can actually successfully keep several balls in the air at once - however, three or four balls in the air at once will work - more may have them spread too thin to achieve anything significant.

<h2>People with Many Interests May Been Favorably Seen as "Renaissance Souls"</h2>

<p>
Margaret Lobenstine is writing a book to be published by Penguin/Putnam next year in which she distinguishes the characteristics of someone that has many interests as a "Renaissance Soul" - someone who is more akin to Benjamin Franklin than Amadeus Mozart.  

<p>
Ben Franklin, if you remember, was a statesman, postmaster, scientist, and inventor.  He differed greatly from Mozart who played music from the age of three on and simply deepened his interest and ability in his craft.

<p>
Our culture has supported us to be more "specialists" than "generalists."  More Mozart's than Franklin's.  We expect people to choose one career direction and stick with that - lifelong.

<p>
The reality is that this 21st Century needs people with multiple interests - what Buckminster Fuller (also a Renaissance Soul - inventor, poet, mathematician, engineer, etc.) referred to as "comprehensive generalists."

<p>
I have been coaching a number of Renaissance Souls lately, having taken special training from Margaret Lobenstine.  I've probably always been coaching R.S's, helping them focus and combine possibilities rather than narrowing down too completely.   Now that I've discovered Ms. Lobenstine's concept, I have a more effective way of identifying and championing these people.  And I have discovered a new perspective about myself - I too am a Renaissance Soul, as are many coaches. 

<p>
Often Renaissance Souls are underemployed.  They and the people around them judge them as under achievers.  The reality is that they are bright, creative people, but they don't necessarily fit our culture's picture of what someone who is serious about their career would look like.

<h2>"Renaissance Souls" Can Succeed</h2>

<p>
For example, I am coaching a man in his early 30's I'll call Jim who lives on the East Coast (I do the majority of my coaching on the telephone).  His family has gifted me sessions as his coach because they don't know what to do with him.  His father was a self made man in the insurance business.  His brother is an ace IT guy.  Next to these icons in his family, Jim looks like a lost sheep.

<p>
But it's not true.  Jim is a Renaissance Soul.  When I gave him the quiz found at Margaret Lobenstine's Web site (www.togetunstuck.com), he answered 15 out of 17 questions as true.

<p>
Jim has multiple interests.  He loves music, movies, fly fishing, outdoors, reading Russian novels and more.  When he felt safe with me - that I wasn't going to advise him to get a job in which he would feel straight jacketed - he confided that he would love to work for a young, growing company - one where he could be doing public relations work to position an avant garde film or a cutting edge CD.  He could also (even at the same time) see himself working for an outward bound organization or a hip resort anywhere around the world.

<p>
I believe that each of these alternatives is possible for Jim.  Together we are looking for ways in which he can combine his interests and reach a higher level of satisfaction in his career and his life.  Yet to have any amount of success together, we first had to establish there is nothing wrong with Jim.  He is just wired differently than his father and his brother.


<p>
Sometimes people like Jim who have many interests are falsely seen as having A.D.D. (Attention Deficit Disorder).  Continuously coming up with new ideas and seeming to be distracted can look like A.D.D. or a disorder.  However, true Renaissance Souls are simply people who have many, many interests.  They also get bored easily, especially after having mastered something.

<p>
A great activity for such a person is to make a long list of interests.  From that list, they can select 3-4 interests to focus on for now.  Any new ideas go in an area of collection - a parking lot for future directions to pursue.  

<p>
Focusing on several ideas at once is foreign to a culture in which people are expected to specialize.  Yet people who enjoy keeping their options open and exploring new territory like Jim need to be engaged with several activities at once.


<h2>Multiple Interests Can Occur Serially</h2>

<p>
People with many interests have been known also to pursue their interests in serial form, first one career direction, then something entirely different.  Take for example, fashion superstar Tom Ford who resigned recently from Gucci at the top of his game as creative director after having turned a failing company around.  Ford plans to take his skills into uncharted areas - perhaps in filmmaking, according to what he's told the media.

<p>
Generally speaking, as a culture we are not accustomed to having people move from one entirely different field to another.  Yet as well known personalities like Ford pioneer a tolerance and an expectation for serial careers, we may see more and more "ordinary" people following suit.

<p>
If you find yourself coaching people who have many interests and are underemployed, unemployed or undecided about what's next for them because they have so many possibilities to sift through, here are some immediate steps you can explore with them:

<ul>
<li>Have them change their perspective about themselves - instead of thinking badly about themselves because they may seem indecisive, recognize that they are part of a growing trend - Renaissance Souls are needed for their comprehensive generalist skills in the 21st Century.<br><br>
<li>Have them identify 3-4 interests to pursue at one time - parking other interests in a future interests file.  Spreading themselves no further will allow them to accomplish more.  There is always another day for those future interests.<br><br>
<li>Be careful of falling into the trap of asking them what they want to be doing five years from now - R.S.'s have a difficult time imagining one scenario for themselves.  Better to have them imagine how they will weave together their 3-4 focal points in the coming year.<br><br>
<li>Have them find support - have them seek out others who identify themselves as Renaissance Souls - these can be among your other clients or in special interest groups Ms. Lobenstine has formed through her Web site (<a href="http://www.togetunstuck.com">www.togetunstuck.com</a>).<br>
</ul>

<p>
Like a cat with nine lives, people with multiple interests never will be bored.  But unless our culture appreciates them and we identify ways for them to thrive, we will all lose their potential accomplishments.
