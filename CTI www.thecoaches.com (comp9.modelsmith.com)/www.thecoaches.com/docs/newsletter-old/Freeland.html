<h1 class="style1">  The Power of Certification  </h1>
<p class="style2" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Completing the Certification Program has been like taking my coaching on a rocket ship to the stars. I was told by friends that it would take my coaching to a whole different level and had heard that I would probably experience some sort of shift during the course. Then, amid all of the learning, I forgot those words.</p>
<p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;">It was not easy by any stretch of the imagination. As I got further into the course, I did experience a major shift in my coaching. All of the sudden it seemed to flow so much easier and it was also more to the point. The unsolicited feedback prior to the course was that I was an excellent coach. The class showed me how much further I could grow. I broke out of the box that defined my old limitations and transported my coaching to a much higher level. What a powerful incredible shift it was! </p>
<p class="style2">I asked my clients their experience of my coaching during this process. Although they did notice some shifts along the way, the most telling observations were immediately following my exam. Even before I had the results, they noticed a change in my presence on the phone. Apparently, even the timbre of my voice changed in a way that really hit home for my clients. I had stepped more fully into my power as a coach and they were delighted!</p>
<p class="style2">My clients were very much a part of my journey. Not only were they supportive, but they were supported as well. They benefited from my growth and were thrilled to be a part of my learning. They were all cheerleaders and eager to hear of my exam results. Certification gave me the opportunity to take not only myself, but also my clients, on that rocket ship to the stars.</p>
<p class="style2">Was I nervous during the exam? You betcha! I practiced self-management to the hilt during the oral portion of the exam. I was sure I had failed. No matter what my results were, I knew this was another opportunity for me to model how to handle success or failure for my clients. Here was another chance for me to grow and learn as a coach and as an individual.</p>
<p class="style2">So what is the impact of taking Certification and the exam? Being a Professional Coach naturally places me in a leadership role. My clients look to me to show them how it&rsquo;s done. Do I push myself, do I strive for excellence? Do I face my fears? Do I walk towards them with determination and that glint in my eyes that says I refuse to be deterred from my goals, my path, my journey? If I back away in a moment of weakness or fear, do I eventually work through it and succeed?</p>
<p class="style2">While putting this article together, I did some research. One surprising piece of information was that some coaches go through CTI Certification and then stop short of taking the exam. As I thought about this fact alone, it came to me how much the process of certification stretched me both personally and professionally. The exam is the final big stretch. What a metaphor for my clients. I ask them to stretch and grow in so many different ways. By taking that extra step of getting certified, I modeled that behavior of stretching and growing for my clients. I demonstrated my commitment to myself and my profession. <span style="color:black;">And by following through to the finish line, I had this immense sense of accomplishment that made it all worthwhile for me.</span></p>
<p class="style2">Another very important part of the Certification Program was the supervision. Intellectually, I welcomed it. My initial reaction to it, though, was outright nervousness. My performance was going to be monitored, and I was feeling concerned about being picked apart in a very critical manner. </p>
<p class="style2">In my actual experience, nothing could be further from the truth. These were irrational fears of mine&mdash;stories I had created before the actual experience took place. Right before my first supervision, I did some thinking, realized the stories I had created and then got clear on what I really wanted out of supervision.</p>
<p class="style2">I wanted help with areas of my coaching that I felt could be better. What better opportunity than to quiz my supervisors on those very things? I was so hungry for this type of information that it became the driving force behind all of my questions and conversations with each of my supervisors. They were very forthcoming and ready to help. It was sheer joy to have direct information from such experienced and credentialed professionals. I felt safe in exploring every nook and cranny of my coaching. The feedback and answers they gave me were invaluable.</p>
<p class="style2">Another valuable benefit of doing the Certification Program came through the community aspect of working with my fellow pod mates and pod leader. Over a period of six months, there was plenty of opportunity for us to support one another and have it serve our learning. I now have this group of professionals and friends whom I can call at anytime to bounce ideas off of or to connect with on the latest issue.</p>
<p class="style2">My experience of becoming certified was such a positive one that I became curious&mdash;what were other coaches&rsquo; experiences? Were they the same, different or a little of both? I spoke to coaches with a variety of backgrounds and training levels. Some were not certified, some were CTI-certified and some had completed Certification through the International Coaches Federation (ICF).</p>
<p class="style2">The answers had a common thread running through them. These were all great coaches, and almost all who took certification agreed that it gave them a huge boost in their self-confidence and took their coaching to a whole different level. Their expectations were far exceeded by their experience.</p>
<p class="style2">Other questions included queries into the impact on income. Are there advantages to having become certified when enrolling clients or going after business contracts? It seems most coaches felt justified in raising their fees upon earning their credentials. That seemed logical. Another interesting fact is that some coaches felt more encouraged to go after business contracts. The increase in self-confidence seemed to translate into taking on bigger challenges. As unscientific as my poll was, it gave me new insights into my own experiences.</p>
<p class="style2">After questioning several coaches on their own experiences, I became curious about the direction of the profession at large. Will certification become mandatory at some point? Pat Williams sits on the regulatory committee for ICF, and he and the rest of the committee are currently grappling with this issue. &ldquo;Government agencies and many corporations require coaches to be licensed before they will hire them,&rdquo; says Pat. He added that &ldquo;certification and self-regulation will keep the government off our backs.&rdquo; In a nutshell, I understood from our conversation that self-regulation will deter the government from stepping in and imposing their own standards on Professional Coaching.</p>
<p class="style2">Faith Fuller, <span style="color:black;">a psychologist, a Certification Program Leader (CPL),</span> and co-creator and co-leader of the Organization and Relationship Systems Courses offered through CTI, states that &ldquo;certification is critical in order to become a good coach. You get this gorgeous set of tools in the core classes. In Certification&hellip;you have experts telling you how to use them. You are drilled and skilled in them. With the core classes, you only need one client to do the homework. Certification requires five to seven on-going clients and gives you six months of integration. The difference between the core classes and Certification is the difference between an intellectual understanding versus the experience of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2">Another CTI leader, David Darst, recalled his experience of completing certification. &ldquo;I went into it blindly not knowing the impact it would have on me and my coaching. My original motivation for doing it was because I was afraid I&rsquo;d lose the learning if I didn&rsquo;t do it. I wanted mastery.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to his own coaching practice, David wears many hats at CTI. He serves as a course leader and Certification supervisor. As a <span style="color:black;">CPL</span>, David spoke of one of the highlights of his job. &ldquo;I get to hold them (participants) for six months. It&rsquo;s a program that allows participants to be touched and moved in a way that&rsquo;s just not possible in a weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style2">So what&rsquo;s next? I&rsquo;m happy to say that I did pass the exam. With Certification behind me, I knew it was time. Time to start working with corporations and businesses. Time to bring this work to the business world as part of re-humanizing the workplace.</p>
<p class="style2">I worked in corporate America for many years and have seen the changes, the mergers, the layoffs, and the toll these take on employees. <span style="color:black;">Immediately following the Certification exam, I suddenly felt hungry for the opportunity to bring the gifts of coaching to the corporate</span> table. This new business direction has inspired me to enroll in the Organization and Relationship Systems courses. I have completed the first course, ORSC Fundamentals, with the last three scheduled for this fall.</p>
<p class="style2">The Certification journey has taken me most emphatically into claiming my power as a professional coach like nothing else could have. Now with CPCC after my name, I look forward to and greet each new challenge with a much greater confidence, sense of professionalism and integrity.</p>
