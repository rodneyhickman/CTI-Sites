<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>CTI Staff Profile&mdash;Sonja Deutsch</strong></h1>
<p>Sonja Deutsch was born right here in Marin County in Kentfield, CA, on October 4, 1973. This makes her a Libra, in case you were wondering, and perhaps lends itself well to all of the checking and balancing that she is responsible for in the Accounting Department, where she is the Accounts Payable Specialist. She hasn&rsquo;t always been in accounting, though. Sonja&rsquo;s first job ever was as a waitress and assistant manager at a European caf&eacute; in Novato. She was 14 years old. She says, &ldquo;I loved it because I was able to serve a wide variety of people from all over the world. I also enjoy connecting with and meeting new people.&rdquo; This also speaks to her background of being dually raised in the United States and Germany. She speaks English and German fluently. Even her last name means German, in German. (Which is odd for the accounting department here at CTI where nearly everyone else who works there is Russian. We were certain for a time that the prerequisite for working in accounting be that one&rsquo;s first name end in the letter a!). Indeed, when asked about what Sonja just can&rsquo;t get the hang of yet in her job, she said: Understanding my accounting crew when they&rsquo;re speaking Russian. I&rsquo;ve learned a few words but not enough to understand what they&rsquo;re saying. </p>
<p>Sonja found CTI through her coach and co-worker Svetlana. She came here about 1 &frac12; years ago after her return from San Diego. As Accounts Payable Specialist, Sonja processes all the leader invoices and pays them on time (it&rsquo;s good to know who Sonja is!). She also processes all CTI invoices and pays those, reconciles bank accounts, does analysis and helps out with the accounting crew as needed, among other things. Being that she is an INFJ, she likes the detail-oriented, problem-solving aspect of her job, which she says, &ldquo;feels like completing a puzzle every time.&rdquo; She also feels trusted in her role, and trust is a very important value of hers, as she discovered in the Fulfillment course that she recently completed. Sonja also values people and authenticity, and says that the best part of working at CTI is working with people who are like family to her and where she can learn something new every day. &ldquo;I see myself growing more every day being in this environment, and I am thankful to have landed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To celebrate a demanding project being completed, Sonja likes to jump out of her chair with arms swinging and scream, &ldquo;YESSSS!&rdquo; Sometimes she does a twirl-y jump off of her desk or a cartwheel or something, depending how big the project is, which is nothing compared to jumping out of a plane, something she did last spring. If you call in to CTI, ask her about it. She loves to re-tell the story. </p>
<p>The biggest aha that she has discovered about herself since beginning to work here is that, &ldquo;Anything is possible when I believe in myself. I have more inner strength than I realized.&rdquo; She also feels that Co-Activity looks like being real with co-workers and connecting with them on a deep level, and that is what she truly desires. &ldquo;CTI is like one big family filled with unconditional love. Even though I am detail-oriented and enjoy working in accounting, I love people much more than numbers, and need to visit with people regularly. I can&rsquo;t just sit at my desk all day.&rdquo; At the same time, Sonja says that she is devoted to getting leader invoices out as quickly as possible and will often &ldquo;sneak back into the office&rdquo; on her day off to make sure the work is done on time. It is clear that she is committed to being here, and CTI is blessed by her presence.</p>

  <li><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t know that I</strong>&hellip;am an artist. I use most mediums, have won prizes for my paintings at art showings and fairs and have sold several paintings.

<ul>
  <li><strong>What is the most glorious moment/accomplishment of your life?</strong> Well, to make a long story short, it was when my best friend and I decided to move to San Diego. I left my job of seven years at AAA. Then my best friend and I chose the city where we moved by grabbing a bunch of Southern CA maps and throwing them all in the air. When the San Diego map kept landing in our hands, we decided that&rsquo;s where we would head off to. I packed up all my stuff, moved down there with no job and not being familiar with the area. I decided to find a job I would enjoy. I saw an ad for a photographer needed and I had no experience, but I had my mind set that I could do it. I signed up, went to the training and became a photographer for schools K-12 covering all of San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties. I quickly became familiar with all of Southern CA. For me to get up and move away from my family was huge and a wonderful experience and accomplishment, as well as going for a job which I was passionate about.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What would we find at your desk?</strong> Two inspiring books, some photographs, a wish-unicorn with crystal and candle, continuous overflowing of invoices. At least two boxes of cereal at all times. A button with a quote saying, &ldquo;Do one thing every day that scares you.&rdquo; &mdash;Eleanor Roosevelt, which is pinned on to a picture of me skydiving.</li>
