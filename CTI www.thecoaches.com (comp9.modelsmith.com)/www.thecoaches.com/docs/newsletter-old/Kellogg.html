<p style="margin-top: 0;">Futurists tell us that networks, collaboration and wildly sharing information and ideas will be the hallmark of successful businesses of the next century. Successful businesses will be holding a &ldquo;double bottom line&rdquo;-- a broad definition of profit that includes reducing human suffering, realizing political and economic justice, and fostering human satisfaction.</p>
<p>Through our years as coach trainers, we know that most coaches come into the profession because they have something to contribute to the world. Over time, that focus on contribution gets lost when coaches come up against making a living. The focus settles into &ldquo;how can I get what I need&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;how can I give what is mine to give.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When you find the place to open and give freely, there is an immediate shift. Your own energy opens up and becomes more creative and flowing. There is more to give once you have given something away. This energy that comes from generosity and fullness is more attractive than any needy/ lacking energy of looking for how you can be filled. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a journey to explore your own business and how you can BOTH contribute and make a great living. </p>
<p>Sit down and relax. As you read these assumptions, pause after each one and imagine how you might apply them to your own business. Ask yourself what is possible for your business if you stepped in and owned these assumptions. <br>
You live in an interconnected web with the world. Creativity is unleashed when you partner fully with that web.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everything you give is received somewhere and sets something in motion you cannot necessarily see. </li>
  <li>Your giving is more powerful and effective when you keep your own well of energy replenished. </li>
  <li>The successful coaching business of the future will be the one that steps out of its corner and networks and collaborates wildly-- freely sharing information and expertise. </li>
  <li>Successful coaching businesses have a &ldquo;double bottom line,&rdquo; a broad definition of profit that includes reducing human suffering, realizing political and economic justice, and fostering human satisfaction.</li>
  <li>You have something unique to give. Giving randomly is wonderful, and giving when fully engaged with your unique gift is even more powerful. </li>
  <li>The way to make your work grow most powerfully is to take your attention off what you are getting, and put your attention back on what you are giving, focusing on the work that is yours to do. </li>
  <li>When business is slow, one effective solution is to give something big away.</li>
  <li> Successful businesses are not built by just wishing. You must both &ldquo;pray to God and tether your camel.&rdquo; </li>
  <li>Your being and energy is opened and transformed by giving freely. This shift in your being shifts your relationship with yourself and the world. </li>
  <li>You, as a coach, are an expert at helping people and communities engage with what they have to offer. Sharing this wildly takes the focus off any shyness you might have and allows you to share yourself more powerfully and creatively. </li>
  <li>You can contribute far more and have a greater impact than you can possibly imagine.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you notice about these assumptions? How might you shift your own business to incorporate them?</p>
<p>For the last 8 years, Virginia has built her business on these assumptions. Often her pay has come from a different unexpected place, not clearly linked to her contribution. When she has let that worry her and lost faith in these assumptions, she has said yes to work that was not really hers to do. The rule has become &ldquo;when business is slow, find a way to give something away.&rdquo; It has been the most reliable way to get the phone to start ringing. </p>
<p>The vital questions in doing business in this way revolve around the ability to both trust that giving will generate something coming back, and at the same time build a solid foundation that supports the business. We are not advocating that you simply stand in faith, and never think about where your money is coming from. And, we invite you to step into these assumptions and notice what shows up when you act from them. </p>
<p>We are on the cusp of a new way of doing business, a contribution-based business model. In it, we offer our services in one place, and our paid work shows up in another place. There is often a time gap between those, where great faith and trust is required. If we are aware of the gap, we don&rsquo;t have to give into our fear and doubt. </p>
<p>We ask you to try on one more assumption-- that the coaching profession came into being for a reason. The world needs coaching and it is time for us to step up to the full power of that. You have been &ldquo;called&rdquo; and there is more for you to contribute than you currently do and more impact possible than the great work you do with your 10 or 20 clients a week. </p>
<p>Of course, you have wanted to make a significant contribution to the world. It is what drew you to coaching in the first place. You will be more successful in your dream if you create partnerships with the individuals and organizations that are already making the differences you want to see. Philanthropy, non-governmental organizations, political parties, schools, visionary corporations, nonprofits, and human potential organizations will all do their work more effectively in collaboration with coaching. You are a vital part of creating miracles in the world. By choosing to contribute your gifts in partnership with others, a deeper definition of success is available for you and for your business. <br>
