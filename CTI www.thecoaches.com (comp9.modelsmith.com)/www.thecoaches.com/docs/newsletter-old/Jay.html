<h1><strong>Learning from the  Masters: A Path to Success for Solopreneurs</strong></h1>
<p>Of all the challenges of being a solopreneur, one of the  most challenging is <em>isolation. </em>By  definition, solopreneurs work alone. If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can start to  believe you <em>are </em>alone&mdash;completely on  your own in your quest to envision, design and implement your business.</p>
<p>Such an approach can be quite limiting; it means your  business can only grow as big as your own narrow perspective. Not knowing the  possibilities, you may hold yourself small, struggle to choose the right  actions and falter in pulling off big plans. </p>
<p>One way out of this box is to employ a practice I call  &ldquo;Learning from the Masters.&rdquo; Learning from the Masters is a technique that  helps solopreneurs expand their vision and learn not only what&rsquo;s possible, but  also how to do it. </p>
<p>In this process, you:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Find       someone who is doing what you want to do.</li>
  <li>Ask       them how they did it.</li>
  <li>Envision       yourself doing it, too. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are a coach who wants a thriving practice.  Yet, even after several years, you find yourself struggling to command the  kinds of fees and clients you&rsquo;ve set your heart on. It&rsquo;s becoming clear that  you lack some of the information you need to transform your business; after  all, if you knew what to do, you&rsquo;d be doing it. You decide it&rsquo;s time to start  Learning from the Masters. You search for a coach who <em>has </em>a thriving practice. You call her and interview her on how she  got from where you are now (struggling) to where she is (successful). <em>Then </em>you sit down and envision the  future of your business, using what you&rsquo;ve learned. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. </p>
<p>I recently interviewed coaching success story Laura Berman  Fortgang, who had valuable guidance to offer new coaches. Below follows some of  her advice. Read this now, then take a moment to use it to inform your own  vision. </p>
<p><strong>Do what you do best.</strong><br />
  Successful coaches don&rsquo;t go into it for the money, the  recognition or the status. They go into it because they love it. To really grow  your business in a hurry, develop a stellar reputation for exceptional  coaching. </p>
<p><strong>Look the part. </strong><br />
  Fortgang encourages coaches to &ldquo;look the part.&rdquo; Dressing  professionally helped her gain credibility and rapport with the professionals  she wanted to coach. Are you hoping to coach executives? Then a suit might be  in order. Planning to coach new mothers? Dress in a way that is comfortable and  welcoming. Donning the appearance that suits your clientele makes them feel  more at home with you. </p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t take no for an  answer. </strong><br />
  When Fortgang started coaching, she knocked on the doors of  a few corporations; they said no. But she knew she needed to build a reputation  that would count! When the front door didn&rsquo;t open, she searched for the back  door. She offered brown bag talks at corporations and asked friends who they  knew in the business community. Eventually, Fortgang found herself on the  inside of a world where she wanted to coach&mdash;a place she never would have been  if she had taken &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. </p>
<p><strong>Give something over  to providence.</strong><br />
  Some things you simply can&rsquo;t create, no matter how much you  want them. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hire a publicist until I had my first book,&rdquo; says  Fortgang, &ldquo;but I still got plenty of press.&rdquo; A friend from <em>Entrepreneur </em>magazine passed her name along for an article, and  someone she had once done a favor for suggested her name for <em>The</em> <em>Oprah  Winfrey Show. </em>She was on the show three days later. </p>
<p>These success stories emphasize the reality of the universe:  when you are committed to being successful and communicate your desires  confidently, the right opportunities present themselves to you. All you have to  do is be ready. Part of success is putting yourself on the path to opportunity  and trusting that it will find you.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your finances in  check. </strong><br />
  Fortgang says she suffered for two years before business  really took off. To survive the start-up stage, she suggests keeping expenses  low and having a plan for funding the business, whether it&rsquo;s giving yourself  $10,000 maximum in seed money, keeping your day job or minimizing overhead. </p>
<p><strong>Double your fees.</strong><br />
  While giving away things for free is a viable strategy for  getting started, it&rsquo;s not a great long-term approach. As soon as you have a  working client base, start increasing your fees. When Fortgang felt she had  proved herself, she stopped doing things for free and doubled her fees every  six months. That way she figured out what the market could bear. If clients  immediately agreed to her rates, she knew they were still too low!</p>
<p><strong>Invest back in the  business.</strong><br />
  One mistake many new coaches make is to spend all of their  income. Fortgang promotes a different approach: keep your finances in check and  invest any profit back in the business. Attend workshops, prepare materials,  create products or hire help so that your business can not only survive, but thrive.  Don&rsquo;t spend the money; put it to work for you.</p>
<p>Reading Fortgang&rsquo;s advice, did you discover some new ways of  thinking that can inform your vision for your business? That&rsquo;s what Learning  from the Masters has to offer&mdash;a chance to think out of the box of your own  experience. </p>
<p>As coaches, we believe that people have their own answers.  But we don&rsquo;t have <em>all </em>of the answers.  Sometimes we need to look to others to expand our own visions of what&rsquo;s  possible and how to achieve it. So the next time you&rsquo;re finding yourself  struggling to figure out your future, or the future of your work, be sure to  look around for who&rsquo;s <em>already living </em>that  vision as a source of information and inspiration. </p>
