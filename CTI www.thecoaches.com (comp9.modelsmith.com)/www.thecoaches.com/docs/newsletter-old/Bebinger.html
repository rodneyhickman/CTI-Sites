<h1><strong>Staying Motivated as a  Solopreneur, or Is There a World Outside of These Four Walls?</strong></h1>
<p>Having quit the  day j-o-b more than a year ago to focus solely on a business, I have learned a  little bit about working alone, and getting myself back on track when it feels  hard or lonely or disconnected or...</p>
<p>The biggest  challenge to me was <em>working</em> in spite  of feeling so isolated. I became a coach because it spoke to my soul, I wanted  to make a difference in this world, and I loved the transportable bit. That&rsquo;s  still true now, and I needed to learn how to do that in a way that not only  kept speaking to my soul, but also spoke to my financial condition.</p>
<p>I knew nothing  about being in business for myself, or I thought I didn&rsquo;t. I came to find out  that I did have <em>some</em> knowledge. And  what I didn&rsquo;t know, I could ask about. People are very willing to share their  expertise if you simply ask them for help. What my coach helped me see is just  what I <em>do</em> have a sense of and what <em>is</em> important to me&mdash;and how to build on  that.</p>
<p>Connection is  probably at the top of that list. Coaching is all about connection and so is  working as a solopreneur. I realized I needed to create my own connections in a  way that fit. I created a coaching circle with some local coaches. We meet  monthly, prepare lunch together and talk about our businesses. We cover a  lot&mdash;what&rsquo;s new for each of us, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, teleclasses we&rsquo;ve  taken or heard about, audio podiums we&rsquo;ve listened to&hellip;you get the idea. I also  co-lead the Co-Active Leadership Mentor Program, and stay connected through  email to friends as well as colleagues, including contacts in my previous  careers&hellip; simply to stay connected.</p>
<p>If you take a  closer look at what you do and how you do it, my guess is that you already know  what works for you, too. How do you connect with people? Where do you go to do  that? What groups have you joined (local chapter of ICF, other coaching  groups)? What calls have you participated in? When is the last time you met a  friend for lunch or went to a bookstore to browse and have a cup of coffee?  When did you last connect with someone who is NOT a coach?</p>
<p>My approach to  solopreneurship is to revel in the freedom of it, and take care of myself when  I notice the &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo; of isolation: anything from being cranky to  crawling walls. Sometimes simply doing something else for a little while&mdash;chores  around the house, talking to friend who is not a coach, etc.&mdash;refocuses my  energy. Sometimes I know that I need to be in the presence of others. And I  talk to my own coach about it. I&rsquo;ve landed in some magical spots as a  result&mdash;and can easily find my way back there with the structures I&rsquo;ve created.  Bottom line: when challenged, get out of yourself and reconnect with others.  And above all, enjoy your life!</p>
