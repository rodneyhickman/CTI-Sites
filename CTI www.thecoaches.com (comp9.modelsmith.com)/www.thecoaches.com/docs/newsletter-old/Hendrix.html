<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Assessments: Tools for Developing Leaders</strong></h1>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;">The cornerstone of my practice as an executive/corporate coach is the development of leaders at all levels within organizations. While the key to success is the relationship I build with the client, I use assessment tools extensively. People are meant to be led, not managed. Therefore, the focus is on leadership behavior and the impact that this behavior has on others.</p>
<p>While qualified to use many instruments, my primary tools are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&reg;, Step II, Form Q (MBTI&reg;) and the Polaris Leadership &amp; Management 360 Survey (Polaris). I often use them in concert: the MBTI to identify individual differences and the Polaris to gather feedback regarding others&rsquo; perceptions of them. (Both of the instruments I use are available online, which provide for easy administration.)</p>
<p>The MBTI was developed more than 60 years ago and is still being refined. The Step II, Form Q, version breaks each type down into five different sub-types (It is not uncommon for clients to have one sub-type that is out of preference with their main type. Can you imagine what it must be like to be a &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; extravert?) The MBTI assists clients in understanding how they get their energy, how they take in data, how they make decisions and how they orient toward the outer world. With this knowledge, they can also understand how others relate differently. I also stress that a person&rsquo;s type <em>is not who they are</em> but how they respond in times of stress or short timelines. In addition to combining the MBTI with the Polaris for leadership development, I also use it to improve team development and group dynamics. </p>
<p>The Polaris is a multi-rater assessment tool with 88 questions that assesses leadership behaviors and skills. It is completed by the client, his/her boss, five to six peers and five to six direct-reports. On occasion, five or six internal or external customers/clients might also participate. Once all participants have completed the assessment, the summary report is created. The report indicates the ratings, by individual or group, on each of 41 competencies in seven categories: interpersonal, communications, management, leadership, conceptual, personal and contextual. In addition, the report contains the individual ratings of the client and her/his boss. The peers, direct-reports and others are displayed as a group. Each grouping must have a minimum of three participants to be indicated. This gives the peers, direct-reports and others anonymity and the opportunity to respond in a direct and honest way. </p>
<p>After both tools are completed, I sit with the client in order to review the results of both assessments. This usually takes about two hours. Many questions, concerns and awarenesses are brought forward. My focus in this meeting is to highlight the client&rsquo;s strengths, especially the ones that he or she may not recognize. I ask questions to drill down in these areas. If the client recognized and owned these strengths, how much more successful could that person be? I also assist the client to identify two or three areas for improvement. I like to limit the number of areas for improvement so that progress can be made quickly.</p>
<p>During the next coaching session, we put an action plan together. The plan is based on what strengths the client is willing to own and on what the process may look like. We also review the areas that the client has identified for improvement, his/her goals and the actions that will move those goals forward. I then have the client draft this plan and review it with the participants who completed the Polaris. I encourage the client to: 1) thank participants for their input, 2) review the improvement plan, 3) ask for additions to the plan, and 4) invite the participants to provide ongoing feedback every 30 days, giving feedback on what, if any, changes they have seen and what else might be done.</p>
<p>After the client has reviewed the plan with all participants, we sit down and add any other suggestions in order to finalize the plan. During this session, I also highlight how the completed changes in the leaders&rsquo; behavior and skills will improve the quality of and impact on the organization, and I inquire about impact in other areas of their life. (The comments are usually something like, &ldquo;If I can do this, my spouse is going to be the happiest person on the planet.&rdquo;) The client now prepares to go forward and improve.</p>
<p>I do follow up coaching for six months to assist clients to: stay focused, celebrate wins, and support them as they work through any challenges or roadblocks. </p>
<p>On occasion, I have had clients request another Polaris assessment after a period of time in order to document changes and milestones they have accomplished.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the MBTI and Polaris are very effective tools that help leaders to identify their strengths and realize their impact on the organizations they serve. Two caveats: 1) whatever instrument the coach uses, it needs to be appropriate for the clients&rsquo; needs; 2) the coach needs to be competent and well versed in the tool(s). The ultimate impact is a very well informed leader who has a big impact on the quality and productivity of their organization. </p>
