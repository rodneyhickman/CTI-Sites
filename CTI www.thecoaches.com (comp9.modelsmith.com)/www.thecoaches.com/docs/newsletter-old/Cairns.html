<h1>Train as the Coach You Are</h1>
<p>I am honored to work with new or aspiring trainers and  educators. Most often, their skill-building needs lie not in the mastery of the  material, or even its preparation and delivery, but in <em>how</em> <em>to be </em>a trainer. How  does a trainer claim and hold the space? How are the learners engaged? What  about learners who want to go &ldquo;off topic?&rdquo; Or people who don&rsquo;t understand what  the trainers are trying to accomplish? There is a whole way of being and  understanding that is needed to be a great trainer. Fortunately, as Co-Active  coaches, you are already there. </p>
<p>Great training begins with honoring the participants.  Remember that your learners are creative, resourceful and whole. They bring  their own knowledge, experiences, perspectives and abilities to the learning.  As educators, we bring valuable information and materials to the work, but we  are not working alone with empty vessels as students; we are working in  partnership. </p>
<p>Accordingly, we must design our alliance. Adult educator  Jane Vella provides fantastic principles for creating powerful workshops and  training sessions in a manner congruent with Co-Active principles. Her <em>Learning to Listen, Learning to Teach: The  Power of Dialogue in Educating Adults </em>(2002) delineates 12 interdependent  principles for fostering learning. She powerfully confirms that sound  relationship-building and program design rely on knowing your learners, meeting  their needs and speaking to their values. If we have the advantage of knowing  our learners in advance, we can talk to them in advance to learn about their  current perspectives and environment. These conversations inform our design  before the training begins. In other cases, we may not know our learners until  they walk in the door. Providing an overview of the agenda you have initially  created allows learners to form a picture of what to expect. As much as  possible, ask your learners for feedback or reactions to the agenda and see  what lands with the group and trainers. Be honest if a learner&rsquo;s concern or  interest cannot or will not be met in the time you currently have together.  This may be a door to future work or an opportunity to explore other resources.  Periodically reviewing the agenda throughout the training demonstrates respect  for the alliance and also helps your learners orient the information they have  received in a larger frame. </p>
<p>In my own work as a trainer and educator, establishing  ground rules within a group has been a valuable tool for creating a sense of  safety, respect and community. I share with the group my expectations for the  training and our work together. For example, I might expect people to only  share what they themselves have experienced and not speak for others. I ask for  participants to respect the timeframe of breaks and return promptly, not use  cell phones, etc. I then ask the participants what they expect from each other.  The response can be simple and straightforward or deeply significant&mdash;a learning  in itself. </p>
<p>And then&mdash;coach! Or rather, train as the coach you are. Dance  in the moment with your beautiful learners and hold your common agenda. What is  present in this space? How is the physical space affecting everyone? What are  your learners offering each other and you with their body language, their  comments and expressions? What needs to happen to go to the next level? </p>
<p>Dancing in the moment during a training can be tricky at  times. You have the agenda you created and want to complete creating a powerful  magnet pulling you forward. When I am coaching an individual client, I can turn  down the volume low on the voice in my head that tells me what &ldquo;should&rdquo; happen,  how much time we have left, etc. Training requires a different type of  self-management&mdash;you need that voice, but at an appropriate volume that also  allows you to hear your learners. And where are your learners? At times, they  will race ahead of you, making connections, mastering concepts. At others, they  may need to reflect more than you anticipated. Sudden insights will need to be  acknowledged, emotional reactions accepted, perhaps going into Process about  what this means for the group. Praxis is learning by doing and becoming  conscious of the experience of learning. When learners become aware of their  own learning, two powerful things happen. First, the learning itself deepens.  Second, the learners&rsquo; commitment to the training deepens. When we as trainers  are present for our learners, we not only honor them but demonstrate how they  might remain present to their own learning. </p>
<p>At the same time, your participants have agreed to an  agenda. Your alliance is built upon this. Here, you must hold the bigger Agenda  of the purpose and goals of your training, as well as the smaller agenda of &ldquo;When  are you going to lunch?&rdquo; As our CTI leaders remind us, if you are stuck, ask  the client. In a training I might say, &ldquo;I notice that we are devoting more time  than planned to this topic. Do we want to stay with this and perhaps take less  time elsewhere, or should we make a plan to move forward in the agenda and  address lingering issues at another time?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Because we hold that our learners are creative, resourceful  and whole, we can trust them to take what they need and can use from our  training. Yes, we want to plan carefully and create a rich and rewarding  experience. Yes, we want to meet the expectations of our learners. AND we know  that with open communication, a designed alliance and room to dance, our  learners will find value. I end every training expressing gratitude for the  work we have done and challenging my learners, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; Their answers are  the greatest reward.</p>
