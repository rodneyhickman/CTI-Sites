<h1><strong>New Foundation  Visioning:&nbsp; Living Your Heart&rsquo;s Desire</strong></h1>

<p>Remember a time when you finally reached a goal or had a  dream come true and thought you would feel great satisfaction. Instead, you had  an empty feeling. What happened?</p>
<p>In this article, I want to introduce you to the New  Foundation Visioning Process so you can have WHAT you want AND also have that  SENSE OF SATISFACTION. </p>
<p>The first step is to connect to what you passionately desire  beyond the physical manifestation of the dream. The second is to create true  expectations. The final step is to hold a clear image of what it would be like  to live that vision.</p>
<p><strong>Desire. </strong>Desire is  the ingredient that connects us to our dreams through our feelings. It&rsquo;s the  resonance of vibrantly and passionately wanting your Heart&rsquo;s Desire. It takes  you deeper into the motive of your longing. </p>
<p>I have a friend who wanted to take her successful  construction company from annual revenue of $1 million to $3 million. Based on  sound analysis, it seemed like the next logical step for the business. On the  surface, it appeared that everything was in place for this to happen easily.  Yet, it wasn&rsquo;t happening. In fact, she was losing money. </p>
<p>She called me in a panic and we began to explore with more  depth what was important to her. We explored these questions: What was her  Heart&rsquo;s Desire regarding a bigger profit? What did she really want that $3  million to give her beyond the obvious? She discovered a burning desire to  support excellence by creating work for skilled artisans. She also realized  that she wanted to create a community in which these artisans could pass along  their knowledge through apprenticeships. </p>
<p>By connecting more deeply to her desire, she began to see  how many of her values would be honored in her vision&mdash;values such as legacy,  respect, creativity, connection, relationship and community. She was alive with  passion to reach this goal of $3 million so she could have a highly skilled  workforce of artisans who wanted to share their knowledge and expertise. </p>
<p><strong>True Expectations</strong>:  My friend and I didn&rsquo;t stop at the connection with her values. We explored  whether she truly EXPECTED to get the $3 million. Instead of truly expecting  this success, was she really only wishing, trying to control, doubting or  fearing? You&rsquo;ve probably known people who set a goal, and then instead of truly  expecting it to happen, they try to control and manipulate everything to  achieve it. Or they wish really hard and at the same time they doubt that it  will actually happen. Neither of these approaches is true expectation. So, what  is true expectation?</p>
<p>True expectation is the energy of aligning with the future  and grounding in the present to receive the future. To align with the future is  to connect emotionally with that desire and what it will truly give you. To  ground in the present is to look at what you are substituting in place of true  expectation, be it beliefs, thoughts, feelings, control, doubt, wishing or  fears that would get in your way of honestly expecting it to happen. These  substitutes must be released in order to receive what you believe is truly  possible.</p>
<p>My friend found she couldn&rsquo;t make the shift from $1 million  to $3 million in one year. It was too big a leap for her. She changed a few  beliefs and modified her plan from one year to two years. She now had beliefs  that could support the increased profit. Her present felt solid and grounded so  she could actually imagine living her vision.</p>
<p><strong>Imagining</strong>. Once  you are connected to what you desire, and you are holding true expectations,  the next step is to create a clear image of what it will be like to have this  in your life. How will your life be different? What do you think you will  learn? Feel the joy and wonder of having this manifest and the positive impact  it will make in your life&hellip;make it up and have fun with it. </p>
<p>The most important ingredients in creating a clear image are  your feelings. Find, create and bring your feelings to your imagining. They are  what make it real. In this imagining, celebrate having it and feel the gratitude  of living your vision.</p>
<p>My friend created a new image of her business by literally  writing a new story filled with celebration and gratitude. She gave her new  success story a title that captured the essence of her desire and vision. Her  business is now moving toward manifesting her vision and she is having a grand  time on the journey of creating her community of talented artisans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you ready to play with this yourself? Here we go.</p>
<p>As you sit here at your computer reading this, think of something  you want. To access your desire, feel the energy of wanting it. What Heart&rsquo;s  Desire gets honored by having this in your life? </p>
<p>Now ask yourself, do you really expect to have this or do  you expect to want it and be disappointed? Is there a belief or story that says  you can&rsquo;t have it? What would you rather believe instead of this limiting  belief? Or, what story would you rather tell? We often think beliefs are true. They  are just the conclusions we write to stories about our life. Since you are the  author of those stories, you can write a new one. Let go of what stops you from  truly expecting this vision to manifest in your life. </p>
<p>Once the space within you is cleared, fill it with images of  celebrating having your dream come true. Feel the gratitude, appreciation and  joy of living your dream. Create a reminder that will help you stay connected  to the feelings&hellip;and enjoy the process of creating your Heart&rsquo;s Desire. I can  assure you, the journey will be rewarding, fulfilling and fun. </p>
