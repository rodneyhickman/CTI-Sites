<h1>Coaching Couples on Money</h1>
  
 <p>(Parts of this essay appeared in another form in <i>White Crane  Journal</i>, Spring 2005)
<p>Often the most challenging thing to address in coaching a  couple is the subject of&mdash;you thought I was going to say sex, didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;d  have thought so, too, but I find that more often than not, it&rsquo;s money. And&mdash;not  surprising&mdash;the two topics are related. Consider this. What if we treated our  lovers or partners the way we treated money? Imagine periods of wild,  passionate attention, obsession even, and then nothing. Neglect.  Irresponsibility. Avoidance. Followed by periods of remorse and resolving to do  better. Balance the checkbook. Be more mindful of spending. No more debt. Even  if your relationship to money is not this dramatic, chances are it&rsquo;s  inconsistent and a cause of worry. In short: an energy drain.</p>
<p>Money: It&rsquo;s all in your head. The amount of money I have in  the bank has very little to do with my peace of mind. I can be down to my last  nickel and not have a worry in the world. Or I can have $20,000 in savings and  stay awake nights fretting. It&rsquo;s all about my relationship to money. And when  we talk about money in a relationship, it isn&rsquo;t very long before we&rsquo;re talking  about love, sex and security. We also end up talking about our tribe, the  family. My grandfather&rsquo;s warnings about the Great Depression, bad business  deals, and missed opportunities all became part and parcel of my own money  story. Being that we were French meant that we hated spending money (almost as  much as the Scots were said to). It is useful to remind ourselves of what our  family stories are about money.</p>
<p>What then are the parallels between our money story and the  story of our love relationships? Where have we felt most secure or insecure in  these relationships? What supports us in relationship and what tends to erode  our support? How does this compare to our relative security or insecurity about  our finances? How have we handled and managed money within these relationships?  When and how are we able to feel generous in our relationships with others and  in the world? </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little excerpt from my money story: My father was  heavily in debt long before it was fashionable. In the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, we lived  in a wealthy suburb of St. Louis  and were considered to &ldquo;have money,&rdquo; though we never seemed to have any actual  cash. I used to sign my name at the gas station each time I filled the tank.  From the beginning, money was abstract to me, a little unreal. We had a cook, a  yard man, a laundress, all of whom made less at our house than when they worked  for the neighbors (and somehow everybody knew this). We attended private  schools. My sisters made debuts, and many of my friends ended up never having  to do a lick of work because they had trust funds. Abstract and confusing. My father  bought the cheapest of everything, which meant it always broke and we had to  replace it several times. He would come into a room where we were sitting and  turn out all but one light. He got irate if I left the ice box door open too  long. It was a waste of electricity. Any money I was given, I was made to feel  I didn&rsquo;t deserve, and often when I asked for something I was told we couldn&rsquo;t  afford it. When it appeared anyway, I felt guilty. </p>
<p>My sister once described the feeling perfectly. Here we were  in a big house with servants polishing the silver, and it felt like we didn&rsquo;t  know where our next meal was coming from.</p>
<p>It makes a kind of weird sense that I grew up to be poor and  proud of it. I thought it was politics. I was a Marxist, had a bad case of white  liberal guilt, and a nasty sense of superiority, largely unconscious. Here&rsquo;s  how it went. I thought owning property was theft, so I rented. I didn&rsquo;t own an  automobile, but if I had one, it would be old and beat up. I bought clothes at  Goodwill. You get the picture. Whenever I saw someone driving a Volvo, I was  filled with resentment. People who were financially secure had sold out.  Economic struggle and distress were marks of good virtue, a sort of outward  sign of inward grace. Once I got ahold of this thinking and saw how  self-righteous it was, I could begin to let go of it. Once my thinking shifted,  I could begin to make a living wage. None of this happened overnight, but it  was interesting how consistently things changed, once I changed my thinking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I saw clearly what my money story was, I could make  choices about how I wanted to change it. So I say, write your money story. The  whole thing in detail, from your first memory of money right up to your most  recent overdue bill. Notice your attitudes about money and where they might  have come from. Notice how deep or superficial they are. Notice which ones you  are ready to change or let go of. Then write the new story, the story you want  to live. Again, begin at the beginning if you need to. Rewrite history. Imagine  the best possible relationship you can have with money and that you are already  there. Write in the present tense. Get really specific about what&rsquo;s in place in  your life that supports this relationship. After you&rsquo;ve finished, look back over  what you&rsquo;ve written and see what steps you can begin to take to make that  happen. Write them down. </p>
<p>Have your partner do the same. Then if you&rsquo;ve been together  long enough for there to be one, write the story of money in your relationship.  Then write the story of how you want it to be and compare notes. In this way,  you&rsquo;ll have all the information you need to design a new alliance around money  in your marriage or partnership.</p>
