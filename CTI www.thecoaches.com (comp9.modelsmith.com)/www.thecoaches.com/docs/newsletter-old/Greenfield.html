<h1>CTI Staff Profile&mdash;Marsha Greenfield</h1>
<p><img src="Greenfield photo.jpg" alt="Marsha Greenfield" width="150" height="226" hspace="10" align="right" />It&rsquo;s a little known fact that we have a satellite office in  Sonoma County, where all details regarding our Leadership Program are covered.  Marsha Greenfield is a member of our staff who works in the Sebastopol office  as our Retreat Services Administrator. We here in the CTI office thought it was  about time that we got to know our co-workers over yonder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lucky for us that Marsha is truly knowledgeable about  herself so that we can get to know her more easily. Like many of us in the  coaching field, she has done many assessments and knows how to use them in  life. For example, when asked about her birthday and birthplace, Marsha said,  &ldquo;I was born on September 2nd (50-something years ago), a Sunday  child with Sun and Moon in Virgo, Leo ascending, and born on a solar eclipse in  Buffalo, NY.&rdquo; Impressive! She says her family returned to Canada shortly after  she was born, so she was mostly raised in Toronto, where she went to McMaster  University for her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Social Work/Psychology. We&rsquo;ve got a  Canuck in our midst!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Marsha&rsquo;s career path has been eclectic and widely varied. In  her &ldquo;first real job ever,&rdquo; she got to travel to all of the capitol cities of  Canada on a research project, assessing program funding. Her next employment  leap took her to I.Magnin on Union Square in San Francisco, where she was the  department manager, even though, she says, &ldquo;I never could quite shake off that  blue jeans feeling inside of me.&rdquo; &ldquo;At one point,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;I even took  drafting classes, and designed and sold moveable records storage systems. Then  there I was&mdash;one day an international purchaser for HearthSong, a children&rsquo;s toy  catalog, the next, a student of gerontology at Sonoma State, working part time  at the CTI Leadership office. I had been introduced to the former program  director, Eloise Tweeten, by a mutual friend. Now I wear the Retreat Services  Administrator hat for programs operating at the Mother Tree, Retreat 5:  Leadership Mastery and Spain. This means everything from recruiting and  training assistants to managing the course materials. I am co-managing the  Leadership office daily responsibilities with Donna  Hess, since Eloise&rsquo;s departure last month. The Leadership office is small, so  in one day I may take a phone registration from Norway, water the plants,  contract a Retreat 5 location, confirm a ropes course event and let our Mother  Tree chef know that someone is allergic to shellfish, while booking a hotel  room and updating a timeline. I can also discuss PAL vs. NTSC technology with  Henry while hopping on one foot and rubbing my belly (just kidding!)&rdquo; </p>
<p>Marsha is an ENFJ on the Myer&rsquo;s Briggs personality type  indicator, with &ldquo;an emphasis on the N and J,&rdquo; which would explain why variety  and dancing with particles are the aspects of her job that she likes best. It&rsquo;s  important to her to share laughter in such a small office, and she loves her  visits to the Mother Tree retreat center. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a slice of deep breath Sonoma  County peacefulness that I tell every potential participant about at any  opportunity.&rdquo; Marsha uses every ounce of the social/enterprising  Virgo-with-a-#8-soul-type-aspect of her personality on the job. Regarding her  insights, she says, &ldquo;When I put it all together, it all fits into my  self-awareness package, but I don&rsquo;t have time to think about it much! Balance  is really my personal goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her favorite part of working at CTI is the positive and  magnanimous people who work here and the humanitarian ambiance created. &ldquo;And of  course,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;the Courses!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her  favorite way to celebrate a completed project is to take a big stretch, a  relaxing walk, have a few deep breaths and a cup of her favorite tea with a  sweet treat, and then complete it with a nice pat on the back.</p>
<p>Marsha&rsquo;s biggest &ldquo;aha&rdquo; since beginning her work at CTI is  that there are many possibilities, so you have to be clear about what you want.  She says that no one is better than her at planning trips to faraway places in  her daydreams, but what she really still can&rsquo;t get the hang of is not losing  the tops to her pens. She applies her learning about Co-Activity in all places  in her life, saying that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s got to be space for everybody&rsquo;s needs or else  it doesn&rsquo;t work for anybody.&rdquo; She adds, &ldquo;Consistent Co-Activity with my teenage  boys might just be the most difficult challenge I face, but I&rsquo;m a good Level 3  Mom and I keep trying!&rdquo;</p>

    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><li>If you       could coach anyone in the world (living or dead), who would you coach, and       why? <em>A rap singer (like Eminem) because so much&nbsp;negativity and       pain&nbsp;is being expressed in the music&nbsp; to so many teens, for so       much money, that it would be incredible to reach deeper into&nbsp;some       higher values&nbsp;to share with young, impressionable audiences.</em> </li>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <li>What       is your favorite food/recipe? What food do you despise? <em>I       love seafood, salads, sushi and especially any/all recipes that include       Meyer lemons at this time of year. I make a&nbsp;great&nbsp;lemon/berry       cheesecake! I&nbsp;despise parsnips. </em></li>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  <li>Most       people don&rsquo;t know that I&hellip;<em>backpacked in&nbsp;South America,       Southeast Asia and Nepal. Also, that I have three cats, two bunnies, one       golden retriever and assorted fish friends at home. </em></li>
  <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0">  <li>What       are you often times found doing at 4 p.m. on any given Saturday       afternoon?&nbsp; <em>4 p.m.&nbsp;Saturday may       find me putzing in my garden, relaying my teens somewhere around the       county, arranging a flower vase or picking a movie to see with my husband       Peter.</em></li>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <li>What is the most glorious  moment/accomplishment of your life? <em>I have many glorious travel memory  moments&mdash;from samba dancing in Brazil, to trekking in Nepal, sunrise at Macchu  Pichu. But most recently, in 2005, I love that I created and produced &ldquo;Pieces  of Peace,&rdquo; an intergenerational reader&rsquo;s theater collection of plays about  peace throughout time and cultures. It was a very powerful, very successful  venue for co-acting 14- to 74-year-olds and a great fundraiser. I also love  that I spearheaded, organized&nbsp;and chaperoned my son's 8th grade  Waldorf School class trip on a tall ship to Catalina Island. These were  essentially &ldquo;volunteer second jobs&rdquo;&nbsp;and yet&nbsp;I wouldn't have traded  one&nbsp;hour for the&nbsp;fulfillment I received in return.</em> </li>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <li>Who's       your hero? <em>My mother was posthumously described as a saint for her kind,       graceful, sensitive&nbsp;ways. Besides my mom, I don't have a specific       person in mind. I admire people who live exemplary lives according to their       higher values and inspire others to do the same. </em></li>
    <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"><li>Where is your favorite place to play? <em>At  the beach, camping, swimming, dancing, dining, luxuriating, any place new and  different, traveling. Play is a feeling more than a place!</em></li>
   <p style="margin: 10 0 0 0"> <li> What would we  find at your desk? <em>Inspirational quotes and symbols, flowers,  lots of paper, tea and a list! I like the quote that says, </em>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;&nbsp;is a slogan for an  interesting life.</li>
