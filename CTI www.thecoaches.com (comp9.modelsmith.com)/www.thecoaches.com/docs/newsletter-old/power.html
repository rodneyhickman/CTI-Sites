<h1> The Power and Impact of Co-Activity</h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in the presence of Co-Active coaches, leaders and managers, you can feel it immediately. There is a qualitative change of energy in the room. Some people call it unlimited possibility; others call it an invitation to be fully alive. I call it love.</p>
<p>When Co-Activity exists, authenticity and intimacy are naturally created. Safe and courageous space leaves room for the unexpected to occur. Energies become unleashed that mingle to form something both previously unimagined, yet absolutely desired, by each person in the Co-Active interaction. There are no strangers in a room full of Co-Active people. There is only a hunger to be deeply known and to fully know the other person.</p>
<p>Co-Activity is about falling in love with the magnificence of humanity in all of its diversity. Each one of us yearns to be seen as special. Each one of us yearns to make our unique imprint on this world. Co-Activity honors just that: our individual and collective contributions to this divine enterprise that we call life. </p>
<p>I hear it when I talk with my clients and feel the excitement moving back and forth between us like a quick game of ping-pong, even though my clients may be 8,000 miles away on another continent. I see it every time I walk into a CTI Certification Exam and feel the heartfelt commitment on the part of each Certification candidate to honor our Co-Active model as they coach their clients. I feel it when I hear about managers in Capgemini and other large corporate institutions who are embracing their authentic experience without sacrificing the bottom line.</p>
<p>I saw it when I went into the federal prison in Englewood, CO, to do the first Certification Exam for two of the prisoners there&mdash;two men who were initially convinced that they were unworthy to live fruitful and productive lives but who nonetheless prevailed, against all odds, and made the Co-Active model their lives&rsquo; work; two men who have inspired other prisoners to inspire each other to be their naturally creative, resourceful and whole selves.</p>
<p>I see it in our Co-Active Leadership program. Each retreat contains magical moments when the power of intention, connection and presence coalesce into outcomes not previously thought possible. I see it in each graduate&rsquo;s leadership project. These projects, rather than merely being assignments to be completed to finish the program, are often the seeds of powerful ongoing international programs that serve the needs of many.</p>
<p>I see it in the practice of relationship. The backbone of Co-Activity is relationship. When people hear the word relationship, many immediately think of romantic relationship. Yet, as social beings we are interdependent and are constantly relating to everyone and everything around us. We are in relationship with others and ourselves all the time. Thus, Co-Activity constantly nurtures what is most natural to us.</p>
<p>Co-Activity at its best encourages diversity and connection at the same time. All are welcome at the Co-Active table. Co-Activity&rsquo;s most potent gift is its ability to transform conflict into learning and cooperation. Co-Activity and its practice of deep democracy allows divergent points of view to be heard, to be respected and to create decisions that serve all members of the community.</p>
<p>The power and impact of Co-Activity is yet to be fully realized. Although each year its influence expands and it enjoys increased national and international prestige, Co-Activity yearns for more. Imagine if governments operated in a Co-Active manner. Imagine if the corporate bottom line turned into providing fulfilling, balanced lives for their employees and their customers while generating enough wealth for all. Imagine if families were based upon the principles of Co-Activity. Imagine Co-Active educational facilities. Imagine a world where diversity is treasured, creativity is honored, and possibility and abundance are overflowing.</p>
<p>Remember the first person that introduced you to Co-Activity? Remember the experience that you had of yourself and of them? Imagine that this is your calling: to share the experience of Co-Activity. As we bring Co-Activity into our daily lives, we can&rsquo;t help but influence others. Co-Activity is no longer just about coaching. It is a loving way of being that requires your participation. To know the true power and impact of Co-Activity, we have to look no further than our own lives.<br>
