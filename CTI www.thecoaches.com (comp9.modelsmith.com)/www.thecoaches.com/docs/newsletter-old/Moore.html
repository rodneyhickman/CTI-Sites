<h1><strong>The Enthusiastic  Solopreneur: Tools for Maintaining Motivation</strong></h1>
<p>As Ralph Waldo Emerson quipped, &ldquo;Nothing great was ever  achieved without enthusiasm.&rdquo; The most successful coaches seem to have  enthusiasm in spades, and this enthusiasm propels their coaching careers&mdash;and  their clients&mdash;towards greatness. However, sometimes the isolation of the  solopreneur life can threaten a coach&rsquo;s enthusiasm. If this happens to you, try  to recapture it with some of these strategies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Choose a Clearly  Defined, Motivating Niche</strong>
</h3>
<p>Perhaps nothing inspires coaches more than a well-chosen  niche. Coaches who are drawn to their niche feel compelled to help their  clients. &ldquo;When you discover your mission, you will feel its demand. It will  fill you with the burning desire to get to work on it,&rdquo; said W. Clement Stone,  author of <em>Success Through a Positive  Mental</em> <em>Attitude.</em></p>
<p>If you are not strongly drawn to your target clients, step  back and figure out why. Perhaps you feel obligated to pursue clients from your  former career field. Or, perhaps you chose a niche simply because it seemed  lucrative. </p>
<p>Although prior experience and financial viability are very  important factors when choosing a niche, don&rsquo;t let them trap you. If you don&rsquo;t  like spending time with dentists, don&rsquo;t target them as clients just because  they can afford coaching, or just because you once worked as a dental  hygienist. If you lack enthusiasm for your niche, it will be hard to stay  motivated as a solopreneur. Instead, brainstorm with fellow coaches about  another potential niche. You deserve a niche that utilizes your talents and  experience, and has clients that can afford your services, but also one that  motivates you.</p>
<p>Some coaches lose enthusiasm for niches that are defined too  broadly. It&rsquo;s hard to feel drawn to an unwieldy category like &ldquo;women&rdquo; or even  &ldquo;mothers.&rdquo; If your niche is too broad, try honing it to something more  identifiable, such as &ldquo;working mothers with small children,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;small  business owners who are mothers of small children.&rdquo; Doing so will give you a clearer  picture of your ideal client. It will also make your marketing more targeted  and cost-effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Implement Structures</strong></h3>
<p>Structures can function powerfully as both reminders and  motivators. If your enthusiasm for your practice flags, dream up some inspiring  structures.</p>
<p>Kinesthetic coaches may respond to structures involving  physical movement (such as dancing) or touch (such as fingering a special  object or wearing particular clothing). Invigorating music often motivates  auditory coaches, whereas attractive, stimulating images can spur on visual  coaches. Because many coaches spend a lot of time on their computers,  interesting computer screensavers can also be helpful triggers. (On a personal  note, whenever I feel tired, I rely on the vibrant, international images on my  website to revive me.)</p>
<p>Creating an ambitious business plan can also generate  excitement. A business plan articulates your goals, and also sets benchmarks  against which you can measure your future progress. Use it as a structure to  propel you forward.</p>
<p>The process of committing a business plan to paper will  bring the plan to life. In the words of economist Arthur Toynbee, &ldquo;Apathy can  be overcome by enthusiasm, and enthusiasm can only be aroused by two things:  first, an ideal which takes the imagination by storm, and second, a definite,  intelligible plan to carry the ideal into practice.&rdquo; An aggressive business  plan&mdash;especially when systematically reviewed and refined in a structured  way&mdash;can keep you on track.</p>
<p>After drafting a big-picture business plan, list the  identifiable next steps to achieve your goals&mdash;and set actual deadlines. If you  get bogged down by lists of tasks, try some of David Allen&rsquo;s organizational  strategies described in <em>Getting Things  Done. </em>The book gives helpful tips for managing information and task  overload, and getting more accomplished more efficiently. </p>
<p>Rewards can also be powerful motivators. Allocate a block of  time for an unappealing task (setting a timer if necessary), and reward  yourself with a treat at the end of the time. Chocolate has motivated many a  discouraged coach!<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Create an Inspiring  Workspace</strong></h3>
<p>Some coaches feel enlivened when they cross the threshold of  their dedicated workspace. If your workspace does not inspire you, alter the  space to suit you, even if you share it with others. Subtle changes to the  room&rsquo;s layout or d&eacute;cor&mdash;even temporary ones like importing a favorite pillow or  photo&mdash;can change its atmosphere and make the space your own. </p>
<p>Coaches who use a variety of workspaces sometimes rely on rituals  to personalize each environment. For some, it&rsquo;s the habit of opening the  client&rsquo;s folder and reviewing the notes from the last session. For others, it&rsquo;s  looking at a client&rsquo;s photo, lighting a candle or sitting in a certain chair  before a telephone call. Regardless, make the physical space conducive to  coaching, whatever that means to you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Connect Regularly with  Other Coaches</strong></h3>
<p>Connecting regularly with other coaches combats the  isolation that plagues many solopreneurs. If there is a local ICF chapter,  commit to attending its meetings; not only will you interact with fellow  coaches, but you will learn new techniques to improve your coaching.</p>
<p>Staying in touch with CTI classmates also counteracts  loneliness. Consider barter coaching with a current or former CTI peer. Before  each coaching session, spend 15 minutes discussing each other&rsquo;s career progress  and sharing practice tips. This will help you build a sense of community and  solidify a referral network.</p>
<p>In addition to hiring your own coach, look for opportunities  to be mentored by a more experienced coach. Unlike coaches, mentors provide  specific career advice&mdash;and perhaps pass on overflow clients. Some mentors will  even teach you the business and share specific practice tips. (In my case, I am  extremely grateful for the terrific mentoring I have received from fellow  lawyer-coach Debra Bruce, CPCC. Thanks, Debra!)&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you live far away from other coaches, plug into the  coaching world through CTI&rsquo;s community calls (which can be found on the  Co-Active Network) and ICF&rsquo;s special interest group calls. These calls are  information-sharing goldmines and marvelous motivators. If your specialty niche  doesn&rsquo;t yet have a sub-community, consider creating one. </p>
<p>Attending the ICF Conference will also expose you to hundreds  and hundreds of other coaches from around the world and their &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo;  The infectious enthusiasm at the conference will invariably renew your love of  coaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Vary Your Routine</strong></h3>
<p>Solopreneurship allows coaches to dabble in a variety of work-related  activities, keeping those that inspire and discarding the rest. What a luxury  to try new pursuits!</p>
<p>Consciously creating variety in your day can alleviate  tedium. Try allocating your time among a cornucopia of activities; in addition  to coaching clients, write articles, blog, network and tend to business  matters. </p>
<p>Ongoing professional development also keeps you fresh.  Whether you take advanced coaching classes, participate in conference calls or  teleclasses, or read articles and books, your clients will benefit from your  ongoing learning. You might try a new &ldquo;improv&rdquo; technique gleaned from a free  teleclass or brainstorm about some crazy new perspectives for your next balance  coaching session. (&ldquo;What would Karl Rove&rsquo;s perspective be?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Keep track of which activities you enjoy most, and which are  most lucrative. Then, farm out the activities that you avoid or postpone, or  those that are not cost-effective to handle personally; for example, you might  hire a ghostwriter to draft your newsletters or a bookkeeper to manage your  billing. Doing so will free your time for more inspirational duties. </p>
<p>Sometimes mixing up your client base adds spice to your  practice. If you primarily coach clients by phone, cultivate local clients to  coach in person (meeting at Starbucks if you don&rsquo;t have an appropriate office).  Also, consider taking on a client outside your niche to keep you facile and  stave off boredom.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Design Strategic  Alliances</strong></h3>
<p>Many solopreneurs rely on strategic alliances with other  professionals to grow their client base. Teaming up with other coaches or  professionals in complimentary fields to offer services (like workshops) or  create products (like books) will broaden your appeal. Brainstorming with other  professionals can also improve your career enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Think outside the box about potential strategic partners.  For example, if you specialize in coaching upwardly-mobile young professionals,  consider a strategic alliance with others who serve the same client base&mdash;such  as personal shoppers, money managers or art consultants. Not only will these  alliances create another mini-community for you, but they will also give you  terrific cross-referral opportunities. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Utilize Personal  Strengths </strong></h3>
<p>We usually enjoy doing what comes easily to us, and we are  bound to be successful at doing what we naturally do well. As a result,  identifying your individual strengths and tailoring your coaching practice  accordingly can magnify your enthusiasm for your coaching practice. </p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t articulate your natural strengths, read <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em> by Marcus  Buckingham and Don Clifton, and take the Gallup Poll-sponsored online  assessment. Identifying your natural talents, and redirecting your practice to  maximize these strengths, will make your practice more enjoyable. For example,  coaches gifted in &ldquo;winning over others&rdquo; will love using their natural people  skills through frequent networking. Those who are talented in &ldquo;input&rdquo; should  look for ways to share their wisdom with others by writing articles, speaking  publicly and the like. Knowing what you do best and consciously looking for  ways to use those skills in your practice will enhance your business. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Emphasize Enthusiasm</strong></h3>
<p>Even the most enthusiastic solopreneur is bound to lose  enthusiasm on occasion. Develop a few strategies to bolster your enthusiasm on  those rainy days when your enthusiasm dwindles. Make sure that the strategies  resonate with you, given your special talents and outlook. Just like your  clients, you are a uniquely talented individual. The world awaits your  greatness&mdash;and your enthusiasm!</p>
