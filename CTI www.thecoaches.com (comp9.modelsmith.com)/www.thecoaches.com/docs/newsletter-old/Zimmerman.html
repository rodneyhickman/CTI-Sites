<h1><strong>Getting  Coaching Credentials&mdash;What Does it Matter?
</strong></h1>
<p>The <em>Concise  Oxford Dictionary</em> defines &ldquo;credential&rdquo; as evidence of a person&rsquo;s  achievements or trustworthiness, usually in the form of certificates,  references, etc. The word credential comes from the root &ldquo;credence,&rdquo; which  means belief. It is derived from the Medieval Latin word &ldquo;to believe.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What do we believe about ourselves as  coaches? Are we trustworthy? Do we want to have our achievements recognized? What  is important about all this?</p>
<p>The decision to seek credentials was  based on my values. For me, the three biggest values that motivated me to seek  International Coach Federation (ICF) credentials as well as the credentials  from CTI are professionalism, commitment to excellence and responsibility. </p>
<p>I want to be part of a profession that  holds high standards and that has a professional body that can regulate its  membership. While coaching doesn&rsquo;t yet formally meet all these criteria, the  ICF is the closest thing to a regulatory body that we have. At the first ICF  Research Symposium, Dr. Anthony Grant of the University of Syndney, Australia,  quoted experts who define a profession as having:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>a shared body of knowledge</li>
  <li>significant barriers to entry</li>
  <li>formal qualifications at the university level</li>
  <li>regulatory bodies with the power to admit, discipline and sanction       members</li>
  <li>an enforceable code of ethics, and</li>
  <li>some form of state-sanctioned licensing or regulation. (Anthony M.       Grant, Keynote Address, ICF Research Symposium, 2003)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Grant also added to this that a  profession must have its own research base and evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>There are now &ldquo;barriers to entry&rdquo; to the  professional organization, albeit not significant. There is a move toward  academic qualifications in coaching and certainly the ethical standards have  been in place for many years. The ICF has worked hard to create and maintain  credentialing standards to uphold professionalism in coaching. The other  criteria for a profession will eventually be met. I am proud to be a  professional coach at this early stage of its development and want to be part  of the growth of even more coaching professionalism.</p>
<p>Excellence in coaching practice is not  guaranteed by having a credential, and not being credentialed does not mean  that a coach isn&rsquo;t excellent. However, having specific and measurable criteria  for admission to the ICF as a credentialed coach is a standard that encourages  quality practice, as does the requirement for continuing education. The rigor  is important to ensure that people with ACC, PCC and MCC credentials meet the  standards.</p>
<p>This leads to my third value, the  responsibility associated with being of service. By being a credentialed coach,  I am declaring to the world that I adhere to the ethics of my professional body  and follow the prescribed standards. One purpose of ethical standards is to  protect the public. It is important to communicate to the public that coaching  practices and outcomes matter, and that there is somewhere people can turn to  if they have an issue with a particular coach or the coaching profession. Another  purpose is to ensure consistency and quality of coaching practice from  credentialed members.</p>
<p>As a trainer of coaches and a faculty member  of CTI, I want to model professionalism, excellence and responsibility as a  professional coach. By doing this, I feel I am contributing to the growth of  professional coaching into a true profession, one that is working toward having  its own body of knowledge and its own research. </p>
<p>Coaching as a new profession is only as strong  as its weakest link. We as coaches must be strong <em>and</em> professional. If you consider yourself a professional coach and  do not have ICF credentials in addition to the credentials from your training  program, I challenge you to get them as a stand for the future of coaching.</p>
