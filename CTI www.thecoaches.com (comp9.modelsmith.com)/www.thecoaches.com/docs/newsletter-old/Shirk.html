<h1> <strong>Organizational Impact of Co-Active Coaching</strong></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>What&rsquo;s All This Fuss About ROI?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Sure-fire ways to determine return-on-investment from dollars spent on organizational learning efforts have eluded learning and development professionals since organizations began paying close attention in the 1970s. When corporate leaders invest dollars in coaching services, coaching skill-building workshops or consulting to set up internal coaching programs, they certainly should be asking: <em>How will I know that the benefits of coaching will surpass the financial cost? </em>We need to be prepared to respond to that question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Today there are numerous studies that provide empirical evidence for the positive ROI resulting from coaching on its own, or when combined with other strategies, such as 360-degree feedback (Bolch 2001; Thach 2002; Luthans and Peterson 2003; Wales 2003; Wilson 2004). As aficionados and practitioners of our particular flavor of coaching, what evidence do we have that Co-Active coaching specifically is useful in organizations? What distinguishing features of Co-Active coaching <em>in particular</em> align with what we know about how adults learn and perform in organizations? Fortunately, research does give us good reason to feel confident that Co-Active coaching is a value-added organizational practice.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>What About Those Cornerstones?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Let&rsquo;s consider the cornerstones of Co-Active coaching&mdash;first and foremost our stance that the client is <em>naturally creative, resourceful and whole</em>. Studies from numerous fields including healthcare, education and business management show that when leaders hold the assumption that the other&rsquo;s capability is high, performance will tend to be high. (Rosenthal and Jacobson 1968; Livingston 1969; King 1971; Eden and Shani 1982; Eden 1992). This positive self-fulfilling prophecy, known as the Pygmalian Effect, has a reverse cousin known as the Set-up-to-Fail&nbsp; Syndrome: employees who are perceived by managers to be mediocre tend to perform at a lower level than their counterparts (Manzoni and Barsoux 1998). We can say confidently that when managers stand firmly in a perspective of confidence, the impact on organizational results will be positive. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Other cornerstones of Co-Active coaching also support the premise that valuable organizational outcomes result from coaching. The practices of following the client&rsquo;s agenda, dancing in the moment and including the client&rsquo;s whole life foster climates in which employees are valued, encouraged to focus on development that is most relevant and meaningful to them, and where they are viewed and interacted with as multi-faceted human beings with whole lives. As demonstrated by a landmark study by the Gallup Organization (Buckingham and Coffman 1999), we know that when employees experience their work in these ways, performance and productivity improve. In his book that resulted from the study, author Marcus Buckingham&rsquo;s description of a great manager is quite similar to the way we would characterize the role of a Co-Active coach. He advises managers to &ldquo;&hellip;do everything you can to help each person cultivate his talents. Help each person become more of who he already is.&rdquo; (p. 141) </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<h1>Impact of the Designed Alliance</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The Co-Active coaching model places explicit emphasis on the <em>designed alliance</em> that is formulated between coach and client. Research indicates that results from coaching in organizations occur most when the quality of the relationship between coach and client is strong (Wales 2003). The relationship created by the designed alliance provides a climate of trust between the educator (a coach in this case) and the learner, and must be continually re-created to remain strong (Daloz 1999). </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<h1>Organizational Impact of Leaders as Coaches</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">In addition to the value that occurs from the coaching recipient&rsquo;s productivity, organizations benefit from the increased learning that happens for those who build competence as coaches within organizations (Rider 2002). Coaching skills, particularly coaching approaches such as Co-Active coaching that are non-directive in nature, correspond closely to the skills of emotional intelligence identified by psychologist Daniel Goleman (1997). The competencies of emotional intelligence&mdash;organized in the clusters of self-awareness, social awareness, self-management and relationship management&mdash;have been found in numerous studies to be an important factor in leadership and organization effectiveness (Jay 2003; Wasylyshyn, Gronsky et al. 2004).</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
<p>We need to be prepared to practice what we preach. When we train coaches to tighten accountability around actions that clients take, we ask for three things: <em>What will you do? When will you do it? and, How will I know? </em>The same goes for our own accountability as coaching professionals&mdash;organizational clients want to know that, assuming they fulfill their part of the bargain, <em>What will they get? When will they get it? and, How will they know they got it? </em>As we begin to work more and more within organizational settings, we must become adept at defining ways that we can measure, in partnership with our clients, the specific return realized from coaching.</p>
