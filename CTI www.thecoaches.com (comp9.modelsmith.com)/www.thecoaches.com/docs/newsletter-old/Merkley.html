<h1 align="left" style="margin-top:0;"> A Visual Approach to Co-Activity: Graphic Coaching </h1>
<p style="padding-bottom:12px;">Did you know that researchers estimate that upwards of 72% of the North American population are visual learners and thinkers? This means that the vast majority of our coaching clients think and learn better when visuals are used. However, the standard mode of coaching&mdash;over the phone&mdash;is an auditory medium that naturally benefits only 12-18% of the population!</p>

    <td width="271" valign="top"><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with using visuals or graphics with my coaching clients. I call it &ldquo;Graphic Coaching.&rdquo; I work both face-to-face (using large sheets of poster paper to graphically &ldquo;record&rdquo; my client&rsquo;s thoughts, ideas and experiences) and also over the phone (using pre-prepared visual templates either assigned as homework between calls or filled out live while on the call). </p></td>

<p>The creation of my Graphic Coaching practice has been a natural evolution. For the last decade, I&rsquo;ve been involved in a niche consulting industry called Graphic Facilitation. We are consultants, facilitators and others kinds of group leaders who use all sorts of visual methods to help groups of people think and work together&mdash;mostly in strategic planning, dialogue and visioning kinds of settings. While I enjoy helping groups of people make decisions and move forward, my true passion is doing that for individuals. </p>
<p>As I took my CTI training (and also alchemical hypnotherapy training), I naturally began to experiment by using the graphic techniques not with groups, but one-to-one with people, drawing out their thinking so they could literally SEE it. I believe in the CTI model that my clients are creative, resourceful and whole, and that they have their own best answers inside of them. My role as a Graphic Coach is to literally draw those answers out of them!&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Best Applications of the Graphic Methodology:</strong></p>

    <td valign="top"><p>Not every coaching situation lends itself to the graphic approach. I have found it works best to help people construct personal visions and action plans, and is also great in helping identify the &ldquo;gremlin&rdquo; or &ldquo;inner critic&rdquo; thinking that is interfering with a client&rsquo;s ability to manifest what they desire. </p>

<p>I tend to use graphics in the up-front or assessment stage of working with a new client. We sketch out their past, present and desired future, and identify some of the patterns, negative thinking and blocks that are standing in the way of their vision. We then construct action plans to link their vision to their current reality. </p>
<p>After working visually (either in-person or via templates emailed back and forth), we default to more traditional telephone coaching. Using the Vision and Action Plan, we co-actively built, as a guiding North Star for our work together. These tools guide and act as a springboard for the ongoing coaching&mdash;allowing plenty of room for process along the way&mdash;zigging and zagging where the client needs and wants to go. The graphics are a starting place, which often shift and change as the client grows and changes. </p>
<p><strong>The General Benefits of Graphic Coaching:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gathers thinking of your client into one central place, gets you literally &ldquo;on the same page.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Focuses conversations yet allows for roaming room.</li>
  <li>Helps clients see their best and worst thinking.</li>
  <li>Makes coaching work more tangible and sharable&hellip;clients see their work and progress and can easily share it with others (therapists, business advisors, loved ones, etc.).</li>
  <li>Improves your ability to market/sell your coaching work (you can show what clients can expect to get).</li>
  <li>Enables you to create systems and products from repetitive processes (helps you create physical and electronic products as another stream of income).</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Graphic Resources:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Graphic Coaching is a relatively new phenomenon&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t found other coaches yet who are using the name and methods like I am, but I&rsquo;m sure they are out there (please get in touch if you are!). If you are intrigued by this way of working, here are a couple of sites to get your creative juices going:&nbsp; </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Start Experimenting and Have Fun!</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">I&rsquo;ve found that clients are very receptive to this way of working. If you want to work in-person, &ldquo;at the wall&rdquo; with clients, then purchase large size poster bond paper (most art stores carry it &hellip; same paper that architectural CAD machines use). Or, experiment with creating your own small size templates that you can fax or email to your clients. Many Graphic Facilitators offer training in the basic drawing and graphic techniques. Check out the IFVP directory (in the site listed above) for a practitioner in your geographical area. You&rsquo;ll have to take those base skills and tweak them a bit for the coaching environment, but it is worth it to do this experimenting and help create a new coaching niche.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have fun in your discovery and welcome to the wonderful and productive world of Graphic Coaching!</p>
