<h1> Self-Awareness Brings Transformation </h1>
<p> Quite simply and profoundly, coaching has transformed my life. Today, I&#8217;m 
  a life coach, relationship coach, leadership trainer and CTI Leader. I have 
  a background in the sciences, as well as social justice non-profits. (Can you 
  tell I&#8217;m eclectic?) I met my first coach, Alan Becker, CPCC, at a non-profit 
  fundraising conference. I was struck by the powerful question on his brochure: 
  &#8220;You work for a non-profit because you want to change the world&#8230;well, 
  are you?&#8221; My answer was &#8220;NO!&#8221; and this led to the painful 
  awareness that my dreams and goals seemed to have slipped through my fingers.<br>
  <br>
  During my design session with Alan a couple of months later, I told him that 
  I wanted to tap into my creativity, to explore the fine arts and writing. I 
  especially wanted to write about my experiences as a birth mother, having given 
  up a child for adoption when I was a teenager many years ago.<br>
  <br>
  That&#8217;s where we started. Then, over a few months&#8217; time, I was able 
  to know what I really wanted, deep down, was to find my biological daughter 
  and to have her in my life. This awareness, of course, brought up the gremlins 
  who told me that she wouldn&#8217;t want to be found, or that I wouldn&#8217;t 
  be able to find her, or that if I did, and she agreed to meet me, she would 
  reject me. After all, who would want to find out that her birth-parent was a 
  struggling, middle-aged lesbian? And then, what about the possibility that my 
  daughter was no longer alive, or had a debilitating illness, or was drug-addicted, 
  or&#8230;, or&#8230;, or&#8230;the list was endless.<br>
  <br>
  Alan helped me discover that what I wanted more than anything else was to know 
  that I had done everything possible to make a connection with my daughter. I 
  needed to know what had become of her and to let her know that I cared deeply 
  about her and wanted to be a part of her life. This was more important to me 
  than avoiding any of the gremlins&#8217; scenarios.<br>
  <br>
  I also discovered the strength to pursue it and the courage to face all the 
  unknowns. Once I got into action, things happened very quickly. Seven months 
  after I hired Alan, I had my first phone conversation with my daughter. When 
  I hung up the phone, every cell in my body felt different&#8212;even my DNA 
  seemed to have changed as a result of making that connection. My life was transformed.<br>
  <br>
  Over the next few years my life blossomed. My daughter and I got to know each 
  other and enjoy our budding relationship. I&#8217;ve had several fabulous coaches 
  over the years who have helped me navigate the emotional terrain of getting 
  to know my daughter, creating relationship with her, and letting go of the imaginary 
  child&#8212;and relationship&#8212;I had dreamed of over the decades.<br>
  <br>
  I decided to become a coach. This is how I would truly make a difference in 
  the world. I took CTI&#8217;s coaching courses, went to Leadership, auditioned 
  to become a CTI leader and found myself in front of the room, leading CTI courses. 
  I also brought coaching to the non-profit world that I care so passionately 
  about. I took CTI&#8217;s Relationship Coaching courses and the Seven Entrepreneurial 
  Skills course and became a leader in those curricula, as well.<br>
  <br>
  One of the benefits of being a CTI leader is that I get some truly valuable 
  coaching from our students. In Summer 2004, at a Fundamentals class in Chicago 
  Metro, I was the demo client for the Sunday-afternoon Process coaching tag team. 
  In that coaching session, I gave voice to a part of me that was still in pain 
  about my decision to give up my daughter for adoption, and was still blaming 
  others for having made that decision. The safe and courageous space of the CTI 
  Fundamentals class made room for me to see this inner victim, without making 
  her wrong. Seeing and hearing her full-force (and she had a lot to say!), I 
  knew there was more work to be done to clear this victim perspective. Within 
  days, I had owned the awareness the victim was protecting me from: I owned that 
  the events in my life that resulted in giving my daughter up for adoption were 
  all initiated by me&#8212;that it was my responsibility. And, that I could love 
  myself regardless and not regret the past. My life changed, again.<br>
  <br>
  A week later, I was talking with another leader about the &#8220;Secret Self&#8221; 
  concept we work with in the Geography class of the Relationship Coaching series. 
  I realized that I have a Secret Self who believed that she could go back to 
  the hospital where my daughter was born, and that the baby would still be there, 
  waiting for me. This part of me believed she would still be three days old, 
  as she was in 1970 when I signed the final adoption papers and left her there. 
  How amazing! Of course my conscious mind knows better, and yet, that Secret 
  Self has impacted my thoughts and feelings every day of the past 34 years, with 
  a sense of urgency that there was something very important I should be doing. 
  Now that this Secret Self has caught up with reality, my background thoughts 
  and feelings are lighter, easier, and I can better experience the joys of life.<br>
  <br>
  The awareness, the healing and the growth go on. Once again, I am shifting into 
  action on this issue. I&#8217;ve brought my new awareness back to my business 
  plan and vision that I created in the Seven Entrepreneurial Skills class. I&#8217;m 
  creating a series of retreats for birth-mothers and others who have experienced 
  loss or trauma, a safe haven to explore feelings, get to know Secret Selves, 
  face gremlins, and process and integrate life-changing experiences. <br>
