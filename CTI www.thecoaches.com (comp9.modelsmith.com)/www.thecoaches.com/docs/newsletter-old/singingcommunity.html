<h1>Do What You Love and the Community Will Follow</h1>
<p>My greatest joy in life is creating community. I love gathering people together to celebrate. My coach calls me the &ldquo;set designer&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m always hosting events that bring my family and friends together for something fun and thought-provoking. The most important thing I&rsquo;ve learned from all my years of creating community, to paraphrase Marsha Sinetar, is &ldquo;Do what you love and the community will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved to sing, but I&rsquo;ve never had any formal training. I sang at summer camp, Sunday school, family celebrations and to my children. Three years ago, I met a woman who reawakened my love of singing and inspired me to create a community of women who also love to sing.</p>
<p>Betsy Rose is a singer, songwriter and the founder of Womansong Circle, a monthly drop-in singing community in Berkeley, California. Betsy and I were both presenters at a workshop three years ago. She sang and played guitar and taught us songs about motherhood, sisterhood, war and the seasons. She showed us how to use our voices to release tension, to express our emotions and to see them as powerful tools for change. She has been leading her song circles for six years, but they are too far away for me to attend. So I invited her to my home along with a circle of friends to share her amazing gifts with them. She led us in an hour of singing and, when it was over, everyone who attended wanted Betsy to come back again. </p>
<p>With the help of a friend who provided a community meeting room, I&rsquo;ve been hosting quarterly song circles with Betsy for the past three years. Through word of mouth we have created a community of several hundred women who love to sing, with an average of 25 showing up each quarter to sing for two hours on a Saturday afternoon. We never know who will show up, yet the results are always beautiful. We don&rsquo;t rehearse and we don&rsquo;t perform. We just come to experience the joy of song and the wonderful energy that fills the room. Betsy makes singing fun and teaches songs that are easy to learn and have beautiful melodies. Many of them she writes herself. She says we don&rsquo;t sing enough in our culture.</p>
<p>Last year some of us wished we could sing more often than quarterly. I boldly suggested we give it a try without Betsy and offered my home. It was risky and scary to wonder whether we could sing without a leader or whether anyone would even show up! But I didn&rsquo;t let my gremlin discourage me. Whenever my gremlin starts stirring up my self-doubt, I remind myself that I&rsquo;m doing what I love and just inviting others to join me. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so passionate about singing that I&rsquo;m always recruiting for my singing community. I simply share my joy and enthusiasm and when a person wants to know more, I try to enroll her. I usually ask if she likes to sing and so often her first response is &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t sing. I&rsquo;m not good.&rdquo; Then I always say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about sounding good. Do you like to sing?&rdquo; Most of us in the group do not read music and some even have trouble hitting some of the notes. But we all share the same joy for song. I don&rsquo;t take it personally when someone says &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because I know singing doesn&rsquo;t appeal to everyone. I&rsquo;ve also been able to let go of the need to achieve a certain number of attendees. I&rsquo;ve come to trust that exactly the right people always show up.</p>
<p>Now, a dozen of us get together monthly and sit in a circle in my living room and sing for two hours. I look forward to singing every month. I feel energized and rejuvenated after I sing. I know I&rsquo;m breathing better and I have more confidence in my voice. Recently, I sang a short solo at a friend&rsquo;s retirement party and loved doing it. I&rsquo;ve been singing to my 18-month-old granddaughter since the day she was born. Whenever I call her and get the answering machine, I sing her a song. </p>
<p>I have tried to create a Co-Active community in which we all contribute to the group process. At our circles we flip through our songbooks and someone says, &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s sing &lsquo;Amazing Grace,&rsquo;&rdquo; for example, or &ldquo;Does anyone know &lsquo;White Coral Bells?&rsquo;&rdquo; We teach each other our old favorites and love singing rounds because of the harmonic effects. One of our favorite rounds is <em>Dona Nobis Pacem</em>, which we sing every time. </p>
<p>This year, I called two newspapers to see if they&rsquo;d be interested in a story about our song circles. One did a feature story in January and the other did a feature story in September. Both stories generated a huge turnout. Fifty women came each time&mdash;half because they had read the article. One of the participants called me after singing for the first time and told me it was a spiritual experience for her.</p>
<p>There is amazing energy created in our circle of singers. We open our hearts when we sing. We send out healing energy to those in our community and we soak it in ourselves. At a recent circle, Betsy asked the 50 women in the room to sing a song to my husband and me. He had suffered kidney failure several months before and had had a difficult recovery. The song was called &ldquo;We Are Sending You Light,&rdquo; and she wanted us to receive healing energy from the group. As I sat there bathed in the glow of smiling faces, I felt tears streaming down my cheeks. For the first time in weeks, I felt a calm wash over me. I call our circles &ldquo;Spas for the Spirit&rdquo; because we connect to something larger than ourselves when we sing songs that affirm who we are and what truly matters to us. </p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned about the power of community is that by doing what we enjoy and inviting others to join in, we spread joy around, and it comes back to us in ways we never could have imagined.</p>
