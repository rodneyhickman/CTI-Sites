<h1>Article Submission Guidelines</h1>

<p>
We are currently accepting articles for our newsletter on topics of interest to coaches and building the Co-Active community. Articles should be between 500 and 1000 words in length. &nbsp; We retain the right to edit articles as needed. All articles submitted will be used at the discretion of CTI.&nbsp; We do not publish everything that is submitted.&nbsp; While we do not pay for articles that are published, it is a great way to increase your visibility in the coaching profession. Please send articles (including a short bio that has a way to contact you) for each month's newsletter to <a href="newsletter@thecoaches.com">newsletter@thecoaches.com</a> by the first of the month. Please also be sure to send a quick note to the same address indicating your interest in writing something so we can plan for your article to be included.
