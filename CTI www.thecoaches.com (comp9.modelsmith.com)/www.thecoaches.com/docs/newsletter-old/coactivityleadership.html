<h1> Co-Activity, Leadership and Your Future in Organizations</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Co-Active refers to the fundamental nature of a coaching relationship 
    in which the coach and client are active collaborators. In Co-Active coaching, 
    this relationship is an alliance between two equals for the purpose of meeting 
    the client&#8217;s needs.&#8221; <br>
    (Co-Active Coaching, Whitworth, Kimsey-House, 1998)<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> When co-active coaching first came on the scene in the business world, many 
  were skeptical about how and for whom it would work. Today, we have some water 
  under the bridge and can look at the successes of co-activity with more informed 
  eyes. Observing the past six-plus years, we see that co-activity has and is 
  successful in the organizational culture because it is based on respect for 
  both the client and the coach, and treats the client&#8212;whether an individual 
  or the whole organization&#8212;as &#8220;naturally creative, resourceful and 
  whole.&#8221; (Whitworth, Kimsey-House, p.3)<br>
  <br>
  This CTI creed might have been in danger of becoming yet another &#8220;feel-good&#8221; 
  slogan of the 1990s were it not for its depth and meaningful applicability to 
  the leadership of organizations. In today&#8217;s extreme ebb-and-flow work 
  environment, the question is no longer, &#8220;Can we afford to take the time 
  to treat each other with respect and see each other as naturally creative, resourceful 
  and whole?&#8221; but rather &#8220;How can we integrate this human aspect into 
  the leadership of our organization in a truly authentic and consequential manner?&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  There are new breeds of leadership out there, such as Transformational-Change 
  Leadership (Anderson &amp; Ackerman, 2001) that call upon leaders to direct 
  change by being willing to be transformed themselves in a healthy creative, 
  resourceful and whole fashion. No longer are employees willing to buy into empty 
  slogans and company traditions for answers to their feelings of emptiness in 
  the workplace. Instead employees are demanding that their leaders &#8220;let 
  go of or build off of their old approaches, and guide the process of transformation 
  differently. In particular, they must transform their beliefs about people, 
  organizations and change itself&#8230;.&#8221; (p.3)<br>
  <br>
  Leaders are being asked to show care for employees in a truly authentic manner 
  and to guide the organization from the place of mutual trust rather than the 
  age-old dictatorship that has worked (one perspective) thus far. This servant-leadership 
  philosophy sees leaders as &#8220;people who choose to serve first, and then 
  lead as a way of expanding service to individuals and institutions.&#8221; (www.greenleaf.org). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Applying the principles of co-activity, therefore, has become tantamount to 
  the successful leadership of the organizational culture. Few, if any, authentic 
  leaders that undergo personal and corporate transformation succeed without the 
  skills of active listening, accountability (yes, I label this as a skill because 
  it, too, can be learned) and the willingness to see others as &#8220;naturally 
  creative, resourceful and whole.&#8221;</p>
<p> The value of co-active leaders to organizations is HUGE. Leaders who aren&#8217;t 
  afraid to: question old ideas, share knowledge, admit when they&#8217;re wrong, 
  treat others with respect and who believe in change&#8212;all of which are elements 
  of co-active coaching&#8212;are worth their weight in gold. Keith Hammonds&#8217; 
  article in <i>Fast Company</i> magazine (2000) looks at the major changes the 
  Ford Motor Co. underwent in order to create leaders with skills parallel to 
  those founded in co-activity.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Ford has always attracted and nurtured capable managers and technicians, 
    but it has failed to do the same for change agents and leaders. So, as part 
    of the auto maker's cultural overhaul, Ford is embarking on a sweeping attempt 
    to mass-manufacture leaders. It wants to build an army of &quot;warrior-entrepreneurs&quot;&#8212;people 
    who have the courage and skills to topple old ideas and who believe in change 
    passionately enough to make it happen.&#8221; (<i>Fast Company</i>: Hammond, 
    2000)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> No matter what your leadership style, if you employ the principles of co-activity, 
  you are more likely to create a leadership role for yourself in this whitewater 
  world of work. <br>
  <br>
  So now what? We as coaches have these great set of skills, and we are witnessing 
  the future of leadership becoming more connected and more accountable&#8230;how 
  can we ride this transformational wave successfully? </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;A leader will only command the level of loyalty he or she is willing 
    to give to others.&#8221;<br>
    (Winston Churchill taken from <i>The Leader&#8217;s Digest</i>, Clemmer, 2003)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It is time to &#8220;be the change you want to see in the world&#8221; (Gandhi). 
  It is time for personal-leadership mastery starting from within. As a coach, 
  you can and must lead by example, which means living your life <i>knowing</i> 
  that you are creative, resourceful and whole, and treating yourself with the 
  dignity and respect you deserve. Others will see this in you and sense your 
  strength of character. Treat others with this same gracious attitude and they 
  will see you as their champion. Take this co-active transformational leadership 
  to your work environment and you will be recognized as a consistent leader who 
  does not waste time talking about what could be/should be. Rather, you are seen 
  as a person whose word is her/his bond. <br>
  <br>
  From this personal-leadership mastery will come trust (self-trust and trust 
  earned from others), which is arguably the most important cornerstone of any 
  and all successful organizational leadership strategies. As with any coaching 
  relationship, be clear about your personal goals as you transform yourself from 
  the inside out and know what changes are important to <i>you</i> (for example, 
  increased ethical behaviour, openness to new ideas, allowing for mistakes in 
  your daily life, letting go of anger, remaining conscious about your choices, 
  etc.). <br>
  <br>
  Focus on your personal transformation so you will be better able to understand 
  your needs in the organization&#8212;and beyond&#8212;and be able to make conscious 
  and informed choices. These are the attributes of a good coach, leader, manager 
  and CEO. Being willing to undergo constant transformation and learning to improve 
  yourself and those around you makes you unafraid of change&#8230;and the bottom 
  line of any organization looking for leaders is that they must be capable of 
  growth and change.</p>
