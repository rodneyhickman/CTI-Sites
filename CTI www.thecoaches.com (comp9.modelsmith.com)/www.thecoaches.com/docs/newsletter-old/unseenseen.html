<p class="style8">Increasing Awareness about Diversity Within the Coaching Profession&mdash;Making the Unseen Seen</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">Diversity is a big focus in many corporations these days. It&rsquo;s no wonder, when companies like Coca Cola and Wal-Mart are involved in multi-million-dollar lawsuits filed over racism and discriminatory actions. Coca-Cola paid out more than $200 million on a race-discrimination settlement. Wal-Mart, the world&rsquo;s largest private employer, currently has a class action lawsuit for gender discrimination filed against it, in which potentially 1.6 million women will be covered.</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">Perhaps these startling statistics are some of the reasons why there are so many lawsuits:</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">White, Euro-American males make up only 33% of the population in the United States, yet they occupy about</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="style3">
  <li><span style="color:black;">80% of tenured positions in higher education</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">80% of the U.S. House of Representatives</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">84% of the U.S. Senate</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">92% of Forbes 400 executive CEO-level positions</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">90% of public school superintendents</span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">99.9% of athletic team owners </span></li>
  <li><span style="color:black;">100% of U.S. presidents</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="style3" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">Increasing awareness around the topic of diversity within corporations means more than locating offices around the globe. Being an inclusive company takes more than hiring people of diverse backgrounds. That&rsquo;s just being physically diverse. </span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;">The parts of diversity that are often overlooked are the intangible aspects of diversity, like becoming aware of mainstream values and modes of operating, challenging personal biases and stereotypes, and making it acceptable for people to express more of who they are at work. Many corporations are still figuring out how to do this.</span> </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The topic of diversity covers so much more than ethnicity and gender. For this article, I&rsquo;m writing from the aspect of ethnicity since this is the area in my life that I&rsquo;ve been unfolding the past few years.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">As a fourth-generation Japanese-American woman, I&rsquo;m bi-cultural. While I&rsquo;m fully American, I was raised with many Japanese cultural values. This may sound cut and dry, but what comes along with being bi-cultural is that sometimes my personal values conflict with my cultural values which conflict with mainstream values. </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">For example, one of my core values is full expression. This often conflicts with the Japanese value of, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bring attention to yourself&rdquo; (which can be construed as selfishness). This, in turn, keeps me from speaking up in meetings and promoting myself.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">This &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bring attention to yourself&rdquo; cultural value is prevalent in many Asian cultures, and it could explain why so few Asians are among the top levels of management in corporate America.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Here&rsquo;s the catch-22 about cultural values: sometimes they serve me and sometimes they don&rsquo;t. And, because they&rsquo;re usually running unconsciously, I&rsquo;m often unaware of how much power they hold over me. Just like any value, cultural values can become hot spots when they&rsquo;re covered up. Often, we unconsciously give up cultural values because they don&rsquo;t fit with the corporate culture or mainstream way of thinking. </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The hard part about looking at diversity is that racism, oppression, sexism&mdash;any of the &ldquo;isms&rdquo;&mdash;are invisible and insidious in nature. They&rsquo;re elusive and covert, and can be easily denied, often leaving the victim second-guessing their feelings. Often times, racism for instance, is expressed in subtle ways, such as stereotyping. We all have stereotypical racial images in our minds, in part due to conditioning by the media and I believe in part because of the brain&rsquo;s need to figure out and sort people for safety reasons.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">For Asian Americans, the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; stereotype of being the model minority or good at math works against us doubly if we&rsquo;re outspoken or not mathematically inclined&mdash;it appears as if something is terribly wrong with us.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">So, what does this mean to the coaching world?</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">As a client and participant in many coaching workshops, I&rsquo;ve found that ethnic diversity is rarely addressed. In CTI coaches training, diversity is interwoven through the work of Arnold and Amy Mindell in Organization and Relationship Systems courses. </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Through concepts like inner, outer and secret roles and Lands work, I found a channel where I could bring all parts of me to the coaching sessions&mdash;what a relief! We practiced triad coaching using scripted vignettes that included same-sex couples. I was excited when there was one mixed-race couple.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">This is an effective way to infuse diversity in coaches training. And, there&rsquo;s room to grow.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In regards to increasing diversity within the coaching community, I believe this starts with having more culturally diverse workshop leaders. And, more importantly, by encouraging these leaders to bring all parts of themselves, whether or not it&rsquo;s within mainstream understanding. </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In her book, <em>Breaking the Bamboo Ceiling</em>, career coach Jane Hyun talks about an unconscious bias called &ldquo;homosocial reproduction.&rdquo; This is where managers tend to hire people who look like and remind them of themselves. We are magnets to what seems familiar, so wouldn&rsquo;t the adverse apply? Wouldn&rsquo;t the diversity of the coaching community naturally change if the leaders were more diverse?</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In the movie, <em>What the Bleep Do We Know</em>, the Native Americans in the Caribbean couldn&rsquo;t see Columbus&rsquo; ships because they had no concept of a ship. Only the Shaman noticed the waves coming off of the water and wondered what caused them. After staring out to the sea for several days in contemplation and wonder, he finally saw the ships.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Diversity is like that&mdash;we only see what we know, and we must constantly stare out into the sea of what we don&rsquo;t know. The brain is wired to see only what we think is possible or know to be true.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">I believe as coaches, we must continuously expand our scope of diversity through being curious and having courage. Jeaneen Schmidt, my wonderful co-assistant at Leadership, once asked me what it was like being Japanese American, and I felt a dam of emotions release through that simple question. I felt like she really saw me that day and it felt great being seen!</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Think about areas where you may not &ldquo;see the ships&rdquo; off the shore and where you may be unconscious about what&rsquo;s really happening. Diversity can be a sensitive and scary topic to broach, so seek out books like <em>Blink</em>, by Malcolm Gladwell, and <em>Sitting in the Fire</em>, by Arnold Mindell.</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">I believe for coaches to truly coach people of diverse backgrounds, we must continue to educate ourselves on what it&rsquo;s like to be a person of color, to have varying abilities, to have different sexual orientations, to have different educational levels than others, or to just plain be different.</p>
