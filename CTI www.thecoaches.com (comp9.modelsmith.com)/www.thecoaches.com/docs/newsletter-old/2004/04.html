Dear Co-Active Coaches,<br><br>

We're excited to tell you about upcoming changes in The Inquiry.  Beginning in May, The Inquiry will be published monthly and will focus on a specific coaching or leadership topic each month.  The topics for the next few months are:<br><br>

<ul>
<li class="no_bullet">May - Coaching as a profession:  Honoring the power of the unique relationship and skills of coaching.  Why does it work?  How can it be put to use more broadly?  What is holding it back from broad adoption?<br><br>

<li class="no_bullet">June - Coaching as a catalyst for learning about relationship and communication:  What have you learned about new ways of being in relationship; about communication?  How are your relationships and your clients' relationships different as a result of coaching?<br><br>

<li class="no_bullet">July - Leadership:  What is leadership?  What does the world need in terms of leadership?  What impact is possible?  What keeps us from stepping into leadership?<br><br>
</ul>

We invite you to submit articles and share your insight on these topics.  It is a fantastic way to increase your visibility in the coaching profession.  Please send articles and business tips to <a href="mailto:newsletter@thecoaches.com">newsletter@thecoaches.com</a>.  <a href="http://www.thecoaches.com/newsletter/submission_guidelines.html">Read the detailed submission guidelines.</a><br><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Many people confronting their next career move have difficulty pinning themselves down.  They have many interests - and selecting one direction for such people feels like putting on a straight jacket.<br><br>

If you are coaching a person who has many interests, there is hope for them.  They don't have to do one thing - they can actually successfully keep several balls in the air at once - however, three or four balls in the air at once will work - more may have them spread too thin to achieve anything significant.<br><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>To Do or To Be?<br>
What is My Purpose?</b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Doing, doing, doing. It seems that we're all in a constant rush to do more and more. Why? Could it be that we're taught that to be something we have to do everything? Or is it that we find no purpose in our lives except through what we do?<br><br>

The answer is yes. There is more to life than this, but to experience it we have to change our perspective from that of a person whose purpose is to do, to that of a person who's purpose is to be.<br><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
So you've gotten through the sample session and the time has come to ask for them to be your client. You speak the 5 most important words, "Will you be my client?" and you wait for a response. The client says, "No thank you".</font></p> 

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Oh, no! What does that mean?! What comes up for you when you hear a "no"? We know that our inner critic can have a field day with this. If we get clear with the CLIENT on what that answer means, we can silence our critic. When you hear NO, get curious with your client. Ask them, "What does that 'no' mean? Does it mean, 'No, not right now?' Does it mean, 'No, not ever?' Does it mean, 'No, I need you to ask me again?' " </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Sometimes clients get scared when we ask them to step into their lives and create big things. The word "NO" comes out as a default answer before they even have time to think about what they are answering "NO" to. Get clear on what "NO" really means to them, not what you think it means. Once you are clear, then you can move forward on how to proceed or not to proceed with this client. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
If the answer, is a definitive "NO" not ever, then move on and say "NEXT!" There are too many people out there in this world who want what you have to offer! Letting go of this client opens the door for someone else!<br>
