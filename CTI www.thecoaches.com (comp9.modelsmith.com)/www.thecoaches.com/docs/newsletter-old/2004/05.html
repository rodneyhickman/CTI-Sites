<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are
delighted to announce that we have a very enthusiastic and experienced team to
lead the new CTI-UK.&nbsp; Together they
represent a vast amount of proven experience in spreading both co-active
coaching and leadership.&nbsp; In this
transition, they have been generously supported by Linda Taylor and Stuart
Durrant (Estrella Associates) who have done such a brilliant job spreading the
fire of co-activity in the UK.&nbsp;
Linda and Stuart have been true pioneers in our community who have put
CTI on the map in the UK through their sheer drive and commitment.&nbsp; They partnered closely with CTI to
choose their successors to ensure a bright future for the precious legacy they
leave behind.&nbsp; Please join us in
wishing them great success in the new endeavors they will take on after a much
needed and deserved vacation.</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now a
word from our new CTI-UK partners: </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are
honoured that CTI and Estrella&nbsp;chose us to hold the&nbsp;torch of
co-active coaching for the next stage of its journey! Linda and Stuart from
Estrella poured four years of love, care, attention and sheer hard work into
opening up the UK and Europe to the impact and power of co-active coaching. </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As many of
you already know, we share in&nbsp;their passion, enthusiasm and commitment.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;team
is headed by Martyn Lowesmith,&nbsp;Zo&euml; Windsor and Andy Denne who between them
have been co-active coaches for over 13 years. Like Linda,&nbsp;Martyn and Andy
were&nbsp;members of the inaugural&nbsp;UK group who were all trained&nbsp;back
in July 1999 by Laura Whitworth&nbsp;and Phil Sandahl.&nbsp;We (Martyn, Zo&euml; and
Andy) continue to run our own highly successful personal and corporate coaching
practices and bring with us many years of business experience to help move the
impact of co-active coaching in the UK to the next level. </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is our
intention that this big fire of transformation that we are all building across
the world continues to burn brightly and spread its reach further in the UK in
all walks of life. In the UK co-active community, as elsewhere, there is an
amazing vibrancy&nbsp;passion and conviction that we have all contributed to
and built. And it is ready and hungry for&nbsp;more impact and more momentum.
As a team, we are here to support and&nbsp;co-actively create, nurture and call
forth&nbsp;new&nbsp;ways of making that happen for us as individuals and as a
group. </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To that
end, we are committed to:&nbsp;creating initiatives to stretch, challenge and
support existing and future co-active coaches in the UK; extending the range of
opportunities for co-active coaches; increasing the availability of
both&nbsp;public and corporate courses; and much, much more!</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whilst we
are carrying this torch we are here to co-create the future of co-active
coaching in the UK. We would love you to contact us with&nbsp;any comments,
inputs or ideas that you have!&nbsp;</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you
for all of the support and good wishes that we know you are sending us. And we
are looking forward to meeting and being in conversation with many of you over
the coming months.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Shirzad Chamine, CTI's CEO, will be moderating an upcoming panel discussion at the Commonwealth Club of California,  America's oldest and largest public affairs forum. The topic will be the  current education crisis and how businesses can effectively get involved.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Due to the enormous budget cuts in education, businesses and educators are faced with a crisis in how they will be preparing the workforce of the future. A dramatic increase in offshore outsourcing for qualified employees is further highlighting the urgent need for this collaboration.

It will have a vibrant dialog about the greatest opportunities for powerful alliances between business and education.

This panel discussion presents an ideal venue to also explore the potential role of coaches in transforming education. The panelists range from a prestigious economist specialized in this area, to corporate executives, to a school-to-career expert, to a high school director.

                                </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By Judith
Cohen, CPCC, MCC</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Webster's Unabridged Dictionary
first defines profession as "an open declaration, public avowal, acknowledgment
or claim". Lastly, it defines profession as "the occupation to which one
devotes oneself, a calling in which one professes to have special knowledge
used by way of either instructing, guiding or advising others or in serving
them in some art as the profession of teaching."</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It takes guts to make an open
declaration, a public avowal that people deserve to live fulfilled and balanced
lives AND that coaches can help people achieve this very lifestyle. It takes
even more courage to publicly declare and avow that each person is a
magnificent being, born naturally creative, resourceful and whole. What
vulnerability, optimism and commitment this profession demands of us! Co-Active
coaching is not for the faint of heart. Co-Active coaching is an active and
constant professing of values and stands that support our clients' deepest
desires and most powerful actions.</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What is this special knowledge that
Co-Active coaches maintain? It is our deep belief in our own naturally,
creative resourceful and whole selves. It is a faith born of experience with
both success and failure.&nbsp; It is
our own willingness to fully live into our Big "A" agendas no matter what
circumstances confront us, no matter how loud our gremlins are shouting. And
most importantly, it is the constant co-creation of our relationship with our
own coaches, the individuals who support our desire to achieve a fulfilled and
balanced life.&nbsp;

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Come Alive!&nbsp; The Artful Play of Coaching.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have been
looking at what distinguishes a competent coach from a masterful one. Of course
experience plays a huge part, as it often takes time to move into that
unconscious competence. The other quality that I have noticed is that a
masterful coach knows how to play. They know how to play themselves and they
know how to have their clients play. By play I don't mean just doing the up and
fun stuff; I also mean able to play with the stuff that is hard and not so fun.
So I got together with an expert in Play, Gwen Gordon, and we have put together
a workshop that trains people how to play and trains coaches how to play with
their clients.&nbsp; (Gwen teaches play at the Institute for Transpersonal
Psychology and the California Institute of Integral Studies.)</p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have
prided myself in the fact that CTI's workshops have always been filled with
play and are highly entertaining as well as skill building. &nbsp;With this
workshop, we are now teaching others how to create this play for themselves and
their clients. </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I playfully
invite you to join Gwen and me in this playground of masterful coaching.

your coaching niche involve working with "baby boomers"?</b></font></p>


<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first
wave of the "baby boom" generation is just reaching their early 50's and
receiving their invitations to join the American Association of Retired People
(AARP).&nbsp; This generation is
redefining the image of growing older and the AARP magazine has been
re-inventing itself to focus much more on the needs of this group. AARP
magazine is working on a project involving coaching and topics of special
interest to baby boomers.&nbsp; This
might include changing careers, getting back in the dating game, risk-taking,
reviving long-lost goals, changing body image --- the possibilities are hugely
varied. The project is still in it's early stages so the magazine is not yet
sure what shape it may take. </p>



<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They are
looking for certified coaches who specialize in working with baby boomers or
with issues that may be of special interest to baby boomers. If you are a CPCC
interested in possibly participating in this project, send your contact and
specialty information to <a href="mailto:kathy@thecoaches.com">kathy@thecoaches.com</a>.&nbsp; Please reference "AARP" in the subject
line. </p>
