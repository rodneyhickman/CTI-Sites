<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
As the largest coach training organization in the world we take seriously our commitment to supporting you in achieving world-class coaching competencies.  As part of that commitment, we have made improvements that we believe take our Certification Program from a great program to "best in business".  In addition, we are making it quicker for you to get started by changing the eligibility requirements for beginning Certification.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b>New Eligibility Requirements</b><br>
Beginning with students entering Certification in May 2004 (applications due April 1, 2004), you can register for Certification after you have completed Process.  In the past, we have required that you complete Synergy before registering for Certification.  You will still need to complete Synergy before taking your Certification Exam and we highly recommend that you complete Synergy during the first half of your Certification Program.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b>Program changes and additions</b><br>
One of the biggest additions to this program is the creation of twelve CDs.  This 12-CD set includes lectures and powerful coaching demonstrations by our faculty and founders with introductions and debriefs by CTI co-founder Karen Kimsey-House.  
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
We have reorganized the order of the weekly topics for a better flow.  We have also reformatted our Certification Manual, making it easier to read, and making the directions clearer.  
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b>What stays the same</b><br>
The student to faculty ratio remains at a low 9:1, you still get a variety of learning models, including our new CDs, individual supervision, an intimate learning community, and lots of opportunities to broaden your skills through a library of recorded teleclasses and a calendar of live calls.

      Join the "Open Mic" on Energy Management.  Call in to both share your experiences and raise issues that challenge you now with regard to your clients' energy.  What energizes them?  What does a coach do to find and enhance energy?  The organizers of this call share an assumption that vital energy of the body is influenced by the mind and vice versa.  Furthermore, Spirit plays an integral role in energy management.  We want to take the mystery and fear out of the concept of spirit.

<b>Struggling to Get the Clients You Want?</b><br>
<b>Here are Some Troubleshooting Tips</b><br>
Building a successful coaching practice takes time, consistent effort, passion, and some specialized knowledge.  And the individual steps along the way might look quite different from one coach to another. However, if you are struggling to fill your practice and are not converting at least one client out of six prospects within five hours of active marketing, here are a few things to check:
<ul>
<li>Are you accurately qualifying prospects?  
<li>Are you running out of prospects?
<li>Are you giving prospects a powerful sample session?
<li>Are you delivering maximum value? 
<li>Are you reasonably organized in your prospecting and contacting?  
<li>Is your pricing on target for the particular group of prospects you are targeting? 
<li>Are you putting in enough time?  
<li>Are your doubts and fears clouding your marketing efforts? 
</ul>
