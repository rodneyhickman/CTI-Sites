<h1>Tap Your
Inner Wisdom: &nbsp;Free Writing to Empower Your Coaching
Practice</h1>

<p>
Free writing can connect you with your deeper truth. Set a timer for ten
minutes and write. Do not stop to think, to edit, or to make the writing neat
or coherent. Let your wisdom flow and see what emerges!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;1. <b>Discover your unique brand. </b>Set the timer for ten minutes and use the prompt "I am...?".&nbsp; See what your writing reveals to you.
Read through the writing and underline key words that express your unique
brand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;2. <b>Unearth the benefit of your coaching. </b>Spend ten minutes writing about the
value that your clients get from your coaching. Get into your client's
perspective. Use this to develop your Hottest Ultimate Benefit statement. <br>
<br>
3. <b>Make marketing easier.</b> If you are working on a piece of marketing writing and don't
have the right words, stop trying. Use a free write to dump all of your
thoughts on the page on the topic. Then go back and highlight pertinent words
or phrases that illustrate your point. Use the free write as a place to gather
your ideas.<br>
<br>
4. <b>Clear the emotional field.</b> If you are struggling with a client and don't have a coach
buddy to clear with, set the timer for ten minutes. Begin writing and vent, let
your wisdom surface and see what solutions your writing can provide for you.<br>
<br>
5. <b>Capture your coaching expertise.</b> After client calls, use a ten minute free write to express
any ideas that came up during the coaching. These post-coaching writing
sessions are an invaluable way to capture your coaching wisdom. You can use these
writings to notice patterns in your coaching and then use the information for
marketing materials. <br>
<br>
6. <b>Connect with your clients.</b> Do a free write with a client on the phone. Go for three
minutes and then read the writing. This is an incredible way to tap into deeper
wisdom of the client. You will be amazed at the synchronicities that may arise.<br>
<br>
7. <b>Gain confidence.</b> Are you nervous about cold calling? Use a free write before the call to
dump all of your concerns. Your wisdom will begin to take over and encourage
you to make the call now. <br>
<br>
8. <b>Collaborate powerfully.</b> Working with another coach on a project? Do a free write
together on your topic and see what your wisdom unearths. Read the free writes
aloud and see where you intersect and where you complement each other. <br>
<br>
9. <b>Develop programs.</b> Do a free write on your favorite topics. Let your mind wander over the
most inspiring presentations that you have given or listened to. Brainstorm
topics that you are passionate about. <br>
<br>
10. <b>Gather your expertise. </b>Do a free write to explore subjects for articles you can
write for your newsletter or other publications. Write as many as you can in
ten minutes, then highlight topics that you could begin to write immediately. <br>
