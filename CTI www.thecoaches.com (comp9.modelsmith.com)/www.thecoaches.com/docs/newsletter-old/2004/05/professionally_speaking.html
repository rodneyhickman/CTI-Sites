<h1>Professionally Speaking...</h1>

<p>Webster's Unabridged Dictionary
first defines profession as "an open declaration, public avowal, acknowledgment
or claim". Lastly, it defines profession as "the occupation to which one
devotes oneself, a calling in which one professes to have special knowledge
used by way of either instructing, guiding or advising others or in serving
them in some art as the profession of teaching."</p>



<p>It takes guts to make an open
declaration, a public avowal that people deserve to live fulfilled and balanced
lives AND that coaches can help people achieve this very lifestyle. It takes
even more courage to publicly declare and avow that each person is a
magnificent being, born naturally creative, resourceful and whole. What
vulnerability, optimism and commitment this profession demands of us! Co-Active
coaching is not for the faint of heart. Co-Active coaching is an active and
constant professing of values and stands that support our clients' deepest
desires and most powerful actions.</p>



<p>What is this special knowledge that
Co-Active coaches maintain? It is our deep belief in our own naturally,
creative resourceful and whole selves. It is a faith born of experience with
both success and failure. </p>

<p>It is our own willingness to fully
live into our Big "A"- agendas no matter what circumstances confront us, no
matter how loud our gremlins are shouting. And most importantly, it is the
constant co-creation of our relationship with our own coaches, the individuals
who support our desire to achieve a fulfilled and balanced life.</p>



<p>Is coaching an occupation, as
Webster's Dictionary might indicate? </p>

<p>Emphatically not! We occupy nothing.
We do however hold a safe, courageous and abundant space in which our clients
can discover the power of their own personal magic. We are the invitation for
our clients to occupy their dreams, their hopes as well as their fears and
their pains. We are neither pre-occupied nor occupied with our clients. </p>

<p>Instead we are present in the moment
and thus able to remind our clients of the power of living a life based upon
honoring their values, owning their honest experience and choosing perspectives
and actions that are beneficial and fruitful for themselves and others.</p>



<p>We are each instruments of Co-Active
coaching and as Co-Active coaching professionals we each need to be committed
to playing our instrument with dexterity and virtuosity. A virtuoso lives and
breathes his or her music 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Virtuosity is a
lifestyle, a constant practice that consistently calls you forth for the rest
of your life. As long as you are a professional Co-Active coach, virtuosity
requires that you keep your instrument in tune, that you submit to the rigors
of daily practice and that you remain committed to the learning in any
situation, no matter what.</p>



<p>What does it mean to be Co-Active?
We all use this word and yet how many of us consciously and deliberately
profess Co-Activity? In my experience, Co-Activity is a state of being. It is
truly knowing oneself and at the same time deeply knowing another. As
professional coaches, Co-Activity requires that we absolutely commit to the
deepest yearnings of our clients. Co-Activity demands responsibility. It is
being able to see and to respond to the magnificence that is in front of us (or
to the voice in our headset) as well as responding to our own magnificence. And
in the magnetic pull of being so known, we can't help but embrace each other.</p>



<p>The Co-Active model is a declaration
of the unity and wholeness of each individual life and of the collective lives
of the communities in which we all live. Co-Active coaching is the consistent
profession of our integrity and our commitment to the wonder and enactment of
the multiplicity of possibilities available to us all. As Co-Active coaches we
are the doing and the being of our profession.</p>



<p>We who engage in the Co-Active
profession are ourselves called forth to call others forth into their own
magnificence. In order to call forth our clients professionally, we must truly
demonstrate all the principles, contexts and "above the line" skills of which
we profess special knowledge. To do any less is to make this into work rather
than the sacred profession of experience we know Co-Activity to be.</p>
