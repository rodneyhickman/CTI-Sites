<h1>Coaching: A Powerful Tool to Impact the Lives of our Younger Generation</h1>


<p>
<i>"To know what you prefer instead of humbly saying Amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer, is to have kept your soul alive."</i> Robert Louis Stevenson

<p>
     We have only now begun to realize the degree to which the lives of the youth majority lack direction, focus and clarity. As a rule, our young people are not sharing with their parents what is happening inside their hearts and minds. Human beings in their teens - especially in their twenties - are striving for independence, separating from their parent's values and beliefs in order to establish their own identity and individuality, often distancing themselves from the emotional connection to their parents which can make communication so difficult. They want to find their own way.

<p>
Statistics report, however, that feelings of depression, disillusionment and discouragement are most rampant among our budding individualists - among those whom we will need most in the next few trying decades; young people, particularly those in their twenties.

<p>
This is a generation struggling with their identity and what they want to do with their lives. Listen to the media, and you will likely come to the same conclusion. What difference would it make if we could help this generation truly clarify their dreams, their strengths and their personal values? What difference would it make if there was someone to support, encourage, and listen to them - someone who is professionally trained to help refine and then put into action what they want out of life? What difference would it make if our younger generation learned the tools that would assist them in creating fulfilling, passionate lives?

<p>
Imagine.

<p>
What difference would it make for parents and teachers to learn coaching strategies to apply to their conversation with young people? Would they reach a new level of understanding and powerfully impact the lives of those they serve? 

<p>
Would powerful listening and questioning skills, as well as parents beginning to see their children as resourceful, creative and whole in devising their own solutions impact markedly the quality of life at home and in our classrooms?

<p>
Why does coaching work? It follows the person's agenda without judgment and, at the same time, encourages the person to push to the next level. By the way of a positive synergy between coach and client, a momentum is created which encourages clients to reach their goals and maximize their potential. Confidence is increased. Empowerment results. Relationships improve. Goals are realized. 

<p>
Coaching clients who come up with their own answers are much more likely to follow through with change and action, as opposed to those who are told what to do by an expert. Therein lies the key...The societal and business landscape of the coming decades is such that simply having a map may not suffice. Sometimes, you will need to bring a guide.
