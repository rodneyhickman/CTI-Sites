<h1>The CALL to Action Marathon- Register Today!</h1>

On October 3rd, 2004, 150 coaches and leaders will come together to participate in the Portland Marathon to raise money and awareness for CTI scholarships, Time To Change prison project and other leadership projects.

You've raised over $2,500 from your community of family and friends. And most importantly, you've created a connection to your body and deep sense of well being for yourself.
