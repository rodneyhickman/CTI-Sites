<h1>Cubic "Knowticing" In Business</h1>

<p>
I am constantly looking for ways to remind my clients of how powerful they really are, of options they may have forgotten about, and of strengths they haven't fully used. And ways to remind them of dreams they may have set aside.

<p>
Listening and recognizing what is truly important to this person, not to me, is, as you know, a key part of coaching. Sometimes I use an image to guide an exploration. One approach is to have a client imagine he or she is inside a large glass cube that represents their business. The idea is to plant a simple structure that they can play with between coaching calls. Seems to work quite well.

<p>
The six sides of the cube represent:
<ol>
<li>Forward: what I see most easily (or think I do, or ought to)?
<li>Behind: what I know least about (or ignore)?
<li>Bottom: where I stand firmly (or refuse to move from)?
<li>Top: what I see as my limits and opportunities?
<li>Left: where I am easy and compassionate, or less than careful?
<li>Right: where I am tight and maybe harsh and inflexible, or is it strong?
</ol>

<p>
By focusing on just one side of the cube at a time and doing so with some intensity, I create a lens, and uncover what might not be obvious at first glance. Each of the six sides of the cube provides a different view, prompts different questions, and suggests different answers about the business. And, wonder of wonders, it surfaces all kinds of great coaching segues that are not necessarily just business. Great. The whole person shows up.

<p>
By expanding their view to include new perspectives and greater awareness about themselves and their business, they become more able as a businessperson. The choice of word that they use to label a particular side can be a great place to start.

<p>
Focus on the bottom of the cube. What is the first word that comes to mind when considering the bottom of the cube and your business? Set that word aside.

<p>
Now notice the differences in labeling that side. Did I think of "floor" or "basement" or "graveyard" or "ground" or "history" or "foundation" or ... ?

<p>
What do I "knowtice" by focusing on the bottom of the glass cube from these different labels as the starting place? The word "knowtice" means "to notice something that is powerful to me-even if at first I am not sure how; the sliver of knowing in noticing."

<p>
I don't know what word you set aside. For the purposes of this column I am going to use the word "foundation," where I stand firmly (or refuse to move from). For the moment, pretend that you are my client and we are talking about your business. Questions that might arise by focusing on the business "foundation" include:

<ul>
<li>What can I absolutely count on in this company?
<li>What am I holding down with both feet, which is either something that has the potential to erupt, or, something that is about to sprout?
<li>What is the treasure that I can dig up from my foundation, the place/market/industry/values that I planted?
<li>What is the opportunity that I am reluctant to embrace because it is not grounded here?
<li>What is already here that doesn't belong?
<li>Where does the foundation need attention/repair/enlarging/or ... ?
<li>What opportunity is blocked by a weakness in our foundation?
<li>And for all of this, what now?
<li>What am I noticing?
<li>What am I "knowticing?" (that sliver of knowing in the noticing)
</ul>

<p>
By focusing only on the floor of the cube, just for today, some new knowing arises. Some new questions take form. Some new answers become clearer. This view of the bottom of the cube is not one that we often take.

<p>
Try this with your clients. Of course your questions will arise from their answers, but the above can provide a possible sequence that might occur. Use the label that you had set aside earlier and generate your own questions. Use the client's label to begin your question string. Then ask them to:
<ul>
<li>Notice the differences in themselves. (perspectives, gremlins, etc)
<li>Notice the "to do" list that naturally arises.
<li>Notice the increased clarity about their business and about themselves.
</ul>

<p>
It's all good because they now have a wider, more complete picture of their business. If you did this for yourself, you will know what I mean. Take ten minutes and try it.

<p>
The theory behind this type of experience is that within ourselves (our deep motivations, our memories, our wants) we have many powerful resources we can use to move forward. Yet we do not access all of our resources nor confront all of our personal roadblocks by approaching the search in the same old way. It is amazing how much this type of simple, free-flowing and yet focused questioning can increase our awareness. The idea of the simple structure is to play a bit, give the client a take away to keep them exploring and discovering well beyond the coaching call. Nothing complicated here. They can do it anywhere, and they will. One can also play with the cube as a whole, "what is the size of your cube in annual income?". And lots of other questions. Above all, having fun in the coaching process keeps things loose and moving easily. Clients will pick this up and run with it. No need to laboriously go through each face of the cube in six successive sessions as they will pick up that which attracts them and tell you. The image can be used time and again as you notice this or that in the client's language and tie it back to the cube. Fun.

<p>
And yes you can use it in arenas other than business. Please do.
