<h1> Reflections on the Similarities Between Coaching and Psychotherapy </h1>
<p>As a beginning coach and very experienced psychotherapist, I am intrigued by ongoing discussions about the differences between coaching and therapy. Much attention focuses on the apparent differences but there has been little discussion on the similarities. This article addresses, in my opinion, the many ways in which the two professions overlap.</p>
<p>There are many different forms of psychotherapy, such as psychoanalysis, psychodynamic psychotherapy, transpersonal psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, solution-focused therapy, etc. One cannot simply compare or contrast coaching with psychotherapy without taking into account the many different forms of psychotherapy, as well as the different models of coaching.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I have outlined what I see as the similarities between coaching and psychotherapy within the construct of CTI&rsquo;s coaching model.</p>
<p><strong>The client is naturally creative, resourceful and whole</strong>. This beautiful concept honors the innate strength in all of us to move forward in our lives towards that which is healthy, fulfilling and rewarding. I believe that human beings can be emotionally wounded and also naturally creative, resourceful and whole. Clients do their own healing. Therapists assist that process just as coaches assist the process of their clients&rsquo; fulfillment. While therapists historically have viewed clients as &ldquo;broken&rdquo; and needing to be &ldquo;fixed,&rdquo; a more enlightened therapist understands the innate resources in all of us to do the best we can with what we have to live our version of a fulfilling life. An individual seeking a therapist for childhood abuse may be the same person seeking a coach for help in obtaining a fulfilling job. Emotional wounds from childhood co-exist within a whole, resourceful and creative individual. The role of therapy may be to heal those wounds; the role of the coach may be to help the client move towards fulfillment in a rewarding career.</p>
<p><strong>The agenda comes from the client</strong>. Competent, effective therapy is about the client&rsquo;s agenda, not the therapist&rsquo;s. While there may be times a therapist is very directive in addressing a particular issue with a client, the overall agenda is still client-driven. One difference, however, is that in coaching, the client is encouraged to come to the call with a specific topic to be coached on. In therapy, the client may not always have a specific agenda for each session, but the agenda unfolds within the process of that session as the therapist follows the client&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching addresses the client&rsquo;s whole life</strong>. This cornerstone is very similar to therapy&rsquo;s focus on &ldquo;the person in the situation&rdquo;; that is, viewing an individual within the context of his/her entire life and not in a vacuum. While therapy sometimes addresses only one aspect of a person&rsquo;s life, the competent therapist is aware of identifying with the client other areas that may be related to the client&rsquo;s presenting problem. Coaching also may address only one area initially, but the coach is aware of the overall process, fulfillment and balance of the client&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><strong>The coach dances in the moment with the client</strong>. This cornerstone offers a lovely metaphor within which to look at the beauty and magic of the therapeutic relationship at its best. When therapist and client are deeply connected and the space is flowing naturally and with aliveness, magic happens in the therapy as it does in coaching. Coaching offers the therapy community an elegant description of those integral moments of engagement that make therapy work.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Creating a safe and courageous space</strong>. This is an essential component of both coaching and therapy. Quality therapy, as with quality coaching, occurs within the context of a positive space and a relationship based on trust, good rapport, authenticity and, when appropriate, straightforward, directive and challenging questioning of the client.</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong>. Effective therapy can only happen when the therapist listens well. While therapists aren&rsquo;t necessarily trained in identifying the three levels of listening that CTI has beautifully delineated, they certainly are trained in understanding their own internal process (Level 1) and listening on a deeply connected level with the client (Level 2). While Level 3 listening is not necessarily a focus in traditional psychotherapy, therapists adopting a more transpersonal psychology model are attuned to Level 3 listening even if not identifying it as such.</p>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong>. The importance of harnessing one&rsquo;s intuition, unfortunately, is not necessarily identified as a useful therapeutic tool. There are many skilled therapists, however, attuned to their own intuition who use their inner wisdom very artfully and skillfully in therapy with their clients. Again, therapists who adopt a transpersonal model recognize the importance of intuition and inner wisdom and use this knowledge in their work with clients. </p>
<p><strong>Self-Management</strong>. The importance of self-management is crucial to effective, quality therapy. Therapy training addresses the therapist&rsquo;s counter-transference, that is, the therapist&rsquo;s unique reactions and feelings to a client and/or a client&rsquo;s issues. The self-management of counter-transference reactions is an integral aspect of quality therapy, as it is with quality coaching. </p>
<p><strong>Curiosity</strong>. While curiosity is an important aspect of coaching, it is less well emphasized in therapy. Curiosity, however, is inherent in any good therapy, as the therapist, with curiosity, learns about aspects of the client&rsquo;s life, passions, pain, inner world and outer reality. While inherent in therapy, curiosity is more emphasized in coaching.</p>
<p><strong>Forward the action/deepen the learning</strong>. This aspect of the coaching model best resembles certain types of therapy, such as solution-focused therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy, which are very goal-directed. These therapeutic models tend to focus less on the processing of feelings and more on taking action steps toward identified goals. Yet all therapy is essentially about helping clients deepen their learning and move forward in life. A stereotypical criticism, however, especially of psychoanalysis, is that therapy merely allows clients to continue to process feelings without emphasizing the importance of moving forward with the insights developed. Certainly this criticism is well warranted for some psychotherapies and some therapists, but it is not reflective of the entire profession.</p>
<p><strong>The principle of process coaching</strong>. Process coaching is similar to psychotherapy in its focus on the clients&rsquo; emotions, deepening the experience of accessing emotions and creating a rich, full internal world. When conducted within a safe and courageous space and within the four cornerstones of coaching, the principle of process coaching is, in my opinion, where coaching most resembles therapy.</p>
<p><strong>The principles of balance and fulfillment</strong>. Achieving balance and fulfillment in one&rsquo;s life are certainly part of any good therapeutic process, although it is not necessarily named as such nor is it emphasized in therapy training. Therapy helps clients to lead more fulfilling, balanced lives. The emphasis, however, is on the elimination of certain emotional symptoms rather than on the attainment of fulfillment. In this area, therapists would benefit greatly from coaching training and techniques to understand the importance of re-shifting the emphasis, when appropriate, in the therapy with their clients.</p>
<p>I hope this article has helped to clarify where these two professions overlap. Of course, there are differences between them. In my opinion, however, it is only when the similarities are recognized and acknowledged that those differences then can be truly understood and appreciated.</p>
