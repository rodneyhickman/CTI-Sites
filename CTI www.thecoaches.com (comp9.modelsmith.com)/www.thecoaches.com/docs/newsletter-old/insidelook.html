<h1>  <strong>Coaching vs. Therapy: An Inside Look</strong> </h1>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re in the middle of your third session with a new client, when he shares about his history of depression over the last 10 years. He goes through periods of withdrawing from others, sleep disturbance and feelings of deep sadness. During these periods, he feels hopeless and helpless. You learn that he had been slipping into one of these periods shortly before hiring you as a coach. Although he continues to slip into a state of depression, your energy, support, enthusiasm and genuine interest in him has been invaluable. He has been inching forward in meeting his goals, showing up on time and is benefiting from the relationship. He comments that he has made more progress with you than with any number of therapists he&rsquo;s seen in the past. Have you unknowingly been doing therapy with this client? Does this client need therapy instead of coaching? What should you do next? </em></p>
<p>Some version of this story will sound all too familiar to anyone who has been coaching for a while. The lines between coaching and therapy can seem fuzzy at times and yet it is imperative that as coaches and as a profession, we clearly distinguish coaching from therapy. One only needs to look as far as Colorado for concern. Less than a year ago, Dr. Amos Martinez, Program Administrator for the State of Colorado, stated, &ldquo;Coaching is an approach that may or may not fall within the legal meaning of psychotherapy or licensed activity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Personal coaches, even those using disclaimers stating they are not providing psychotherapy, may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Regulatory Boards&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.dora.state.co.us/mental-health/trends.htm"><u>www.dora.state.co.us/mental-health/trends.htm</u></a>). Fortunately, in the spring of 2004, the Governor of Colorado signed the following into Colorado&rsquo;s Mental Health Statues: &ldquo;The provisions of this article shall not apply to professional coaches who have had coach-specific training and who serve clients exclusively in the capacity of coaches,&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.coachfederation.org/regulatory/history.asp"><u>www.coachfederation.org/regulatory/history.asp</u></a>). Despite this, the International Coach Federation notes that a March 2003 Regulatory Report rumors that in addition to Colorado, Minnesota, Florida, Washington and California coaches may be required to register as unlicensed professionals.</p>
<p><br>
  At this time, coaching is an unlicensed profession and does not fall under the mental health/behavioral health realm (<a href="http://www.coachingfederation.org/regulatory/history.asp"><u>www.coachingfederation.org/regulatory/history.asp</u></a>). However, as a professional coach, there are three main reasons for understanding when coaching becomes therapy: 1) best practices; 2) legal and ethical standards; and 3) representation of the coaching profession.</p>
<p>I am both a coach and a therapist, and I teach a foundations program for therapists transitioning their practice into coaching. Thus, this topic is very near and dear to my heart.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So why is it so difficult to understand the differences between coaching and therapy? Well, have you ever tried to explain coaching to someone? Ask 100 coaches to define coaching and you&rsquo;ll get 100 different responses. The same goes for therapy. Ask 100 therapists to define therapy and you&rsquo;ll get the same results. Why is this? Even though personal coaching is relatively new compared to psychotherapy, both professions are continuing to evolve. Psychology is moving away from the medical model of seeing someone as dysfunctional or ill and in need of treatment and moving more towards seeing the person as whole, creative and resourceful (does this sound familiar?).</p>
<p>As Co-Active coaches, we hold that our clients are whole, creative and resourceful, and they are&hellip;except for when they&rsquo;re not. Someone with schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorder needs psychiatric intervention. Could coaching help these individuals? Absolutely, but coaching is not used to treat the disorder. On the flip side, feelings don&rsquo;t belong to therapy; they belong to the human experience. Further, just because something might be &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; does not mean you are doing therapy.</p>
<p>So how do you know when you&rsquo;re slipping into therapy terrain? Here are seven major differences between <em>traditional</em> psychotherapy and coaching: </p>
<ul>
  <li>As coaches we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;treat&rdquo; mental health disorders. </li>
  <li>Coaches are collaborators rather than experts. (This is the most difficult adjustment I&rsquo;ve witnessed with therapists transitioning into coaching.)</li>
  <li>Therapists rely on psychological theory, etiology and treatment plans for wisdom; as coaches, we look within the client for wisdom. </li>
  <li>Therapy often asks, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and concerns itself with the client&rsquo;s past; coaching often asks, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; and concerns itself more with the present and future. </li>
  <li>Therapy seeks to fix unresolved issues; coaching seeks to help the client achieve greater fulfillment, balance and be fully in the process of his or her life. </li>
  <li>Co-Active coaching focuses on the client&rsquo;s whole life; traditional psychotherapy targets specific symptoms. </li>
  <li>Traditional therapists withhold intuitive thoughts; coaches blurt intuitive thoughts. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top 10 Best Practices: Coaching, Not Therapy (Jeff Kaplan, 2005)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>During the intake, <strong>clearly define and co-design the coaching relationship</strong> with your client&mdash;identifying what coaching is and what coaching isn&rsquo;t. See <a href="http://www.coachingfederation.org/aboutcoaching/about.asp"><u>www.coachingfederation.org/aboutcoaching/about.asp</u></a>, item #13 for a distinction of coaching from other services, including therapy.</li>
  <li>Ask your new client<strong> </strong>if s/he is in therapy. If so, <strong>get written permission to speak with the client&rsquo;s therapist</strong>, making sure the therapist understands your role and the coaching goals. Yield to the therapist as having primary responsibility for the client&rsquo;s well-being.</li>
  <li>If the client is not in counseling and needs therapy in order to overcome a mental health disorder that is significantly impacting his or her daily functioning, <strong>do not begin coaching until the client is in therapy and is stable</strong>. If you&rsquo;ve already begun coaching, then limit the focus and scope of the coaching to getting the client into therapy as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not agree to provide coaching as a substitute for needed therapy</strong>, regardless of the value you might be able to provide to your client.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure about the potential therapy needs of a particular client, <strong>consult with other seasoned coaches, therapists and/or a lawyer who is an expert in this area</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Document! </strong>For example, record in your client&rsquo;s notes that you gave him or her a handout on &ldquo;Coaching Versus Therapy&rdquo; in the client&rsquo;s welcome packet and/or keep a copy of the signed coaching agreement that clearly distinguishes coaching as separate and distinct from therapy.</li>
  <li><strong>Continually seek out advanced coach training</strong>, especially in ethical practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Continually seek to improve yourself personally</strong>, raising your own level of self-understanding and clarifying your own needs. The more self-aware you are, the more &ldquo;places&rdquo; you will be able to travel with your client and greater benefit you will be able to provide as a coach.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with your client</strong>. Don&rsquo;t shy away from a much-needed conversation because it might be uncomfortable. Share your concerns and ask questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust your instincts</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adhering to this list of best practices will not guarantee a totally risk-free coaching business, but hopefully it has stimulated your awareness and will help you to minimize the risk of crossing into therapy territory. In practice, it is relatively uncommon for coaches to find themselves working with a client who should be in therapy instead of, or at least in addition to, coaching. If it does happen to you, however, hopefully you&rsquo;ll now be more prepared.</p>
