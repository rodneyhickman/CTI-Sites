<p class="style1" style="margin-top:0;">Increasing Diversity of Coaches and the Coached</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top:0;">Diversity is a hot topic these days, as well it should be. The level of interaction between different groups in the world is increasing dramatically. It used to be that when people thought about a nation state, they assumed it consisted of one ethnic group in one geographic location. This is no longer true. Today we have Brazilian Japanese and French Arabs. People move around the globe. A person's culture, ethnicity and citizenship are not all the same. A French citizen may not be European and may not have been raised in French culture.</p>
<p class="style3">Within the United States alone, the oft-mentioned statistic that by 2050, 50% of the country will speak Spanish, is another way to view this change. High schools in most large cities often deal with school populations that speak more than 150 languages. Just the other day, I sat with a group of middle school students in a Boston public school, all of whom were children of immigrants from the following countries: Haiti, Vietnam, Mexico and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="style3">Major corporations have on-going diversity initiatives, realizing that they must acknowledge the diversity of the workforce. We not only have global teams that speak to each other by teleconference across multiple time zones, but we have local teams that are made up of people of different backgrounds, ages, sexual orientations, personalities, communication styles, etc. Corporations now know they must help people to get along across all the differences.</p>
<p class="style3">While most of the time people first think to race, ethnicity or gender when considering diversity, we look at a wider range of dimensions today, such as socioeconomic/class, age, sexual orientation, physical disabilities, language, religion and many more. Even though all these are important, I will focus here on racial, ethnic and cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="style3">The vast majority of people who attend coaching classes have traditionally been white. One could say that coaching is much more available to those with privileges, to people who are able to pay for the courses and to those who are high enough on the Maslow's need hierarchy to be able to pay attention to following their dreams and living out their life purpose rather than worrying about how to pay the bills or keep from being deported. There are also cultural reasons&mdash;mainstream white culture more readily accepts the study of psychology and its resultant therapies. This acceptance certainly helps in embracing the concept of coaching. Not all cultures feel comfortable talking about themselves to others or reflecting on themselves.</p>
<p class="style3">If we are to increase the numbers of people of color (people who are not white) and immigrants who pursue coaching as a career and/or as a service, there are a lot of things we can all do, both from the perspective of the field as well as individually.</p>
<p class="style3">Certainly, the organizations of the field, CTI, ICF, etc., need to market coaching as a service and as a career at venues where we can reach the various racial and ethnic groups. We need to make sure we present in front of diverse groups when choosing speaking engagements. We must plan for the long term, keeping in mind that with some groups, it will take more time to build up coaching as a service that people are willing to pay for, that they consider valuable. For example, the Chinese in China are only now starting to value consulting services. Before, these services seemed too abstract and not something tangible you can pay for. Each coaching organization needs a diversity initiative just like corporations to look at everything from recruiting and hiring internally, to workshop design, to marketing externally. This keeps diversity top-of-mind at all times.</p>
<p class="style3">Individually and collectively, we also need to educate people who have had less exposure to coaching to help them understand the concept and consider it as a career option. It is a newer field and as such has much less of a reputation. For immigrants and people of color, it appears to be a less stable, less established field than, say, nursing, civil service or government. </p>
<p class="style3">Coaches who are white also need to consider how they can be more effective when coaching people of color. As within any group, people in a group represent a range of experiences and perceptions. One needs to be prepared for that diversity. One might encounter people of color who need to talk to someone who can confront and acknowledge the pain, anger and challenge that comes from living in a country that was founded on racism. One might also encounter people of color who do not feel that they have suffered from racism at all. One might encounter people who want to be coached by someone who looks like them and others who don't have a preference. Having the ability to be compassionate and step into a different reality from one&rsquo;s own experience is important in coaching and especially in dealing across race and difference.</p>
<p class="style3">Also, it helps to be better informed about more people's cultures and histories, so one can understand where an individual is coming from. It helps to educate oneself about the impact of racism on America, as well as to understand the different circumstances that have brought people to the United States, since most of us trace ourselves to immigrants.</p>
<p class="style3">If you want to deepen your knowledge and capacity, some recommended books include:</p>
<p class="style3"><em>Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? and Other Conversations About Race: A Psychologist Explains the Development of Racial Identity</em>, revised edition by Beverly Daniel Tatum</p>
<p class="style3"><em>A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America,</em> by Ron Takaki</p>
<p class="style3"><em>The Possessive Investment in Whiteness, How White People Profit from Identity Politics</em>, by George Lipsitz</p>
<p class="style3">And a good book on Asian American History: <em>Asian American Dreams,</em> by Helen Zia.</p>
<p class="style3">These are some first steps to making sure that the people we coach and the coaches that are available represent the racial, ethnic and cultural diversity that exists. Then we can expand to the other dimensions of difference.</p>
