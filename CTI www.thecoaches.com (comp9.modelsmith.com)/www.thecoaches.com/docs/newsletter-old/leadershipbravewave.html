<h1> Leadership</h1>
<h3>What is leadership? What does the world need in terms of leadership? What 
  impact is possible? What keeps us from stepping into leadership?</h3>
<p> As someone who is currently three-quarters of the way through CTI&#8217;s 
  Leadership programme (yes, I&#8217;m English!), these questions intrigue me&#8212;surely 
  I should have some answers by now&#8212;so this article is my attempt to answer 
  those questions, both for myself and perhaps for you.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><b>What is leadership?</b></p>
<p> Well it&#8217;s kind of easier to say what it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not 
  what you think it is. It&#8217;s not about becoming someone else. It&#8217;s 
  actually about becoming yourself&#8212;which sounds kind of easy, doesn&#8217;t 
  it?&#8212;and to some extent, that is true. It can be the hardest thing in the 
  world, too.</p>
<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<p><b>Let me explain&#8212;or at least give you a perspective: my own.</b></p>
<p> I have always known deep down inside that I am on this planet for some kind 
  of reason other than to &#8220;make a success&#8221; of my life as interpreted 
  by a civilised Western economy. I never knew what that reason was until I stepped 
  &#8220;blindly&#8221; into the Leadership programme. It was just so compelling&#8212;I 
  HAD to sign up&#8212;it was as if I knew that this was my chance to discover 
  who I am and why I am here. These are questions we all ask ourselves when we 
  are kids growing up, and then somewhere along the line we think we know the 
  answer or, more likely, we forget to ask the question any more. I found that 
  this strange compulsion to &#8220;show up&#8221; at Leadership was the same 
  for all the other people on the programme. We weren&#8217;t &#8220;leaders,&#8221; 
  we were just ordinary folk who had some kind of extraordinary desire to find 
  out what this leadership thing was all about.<br>
  <br>
  In a way, that is what I think leadership is: a quest for understanding, a thirst 
  for knowledge, a desire to be more, a passion for humankind. It&#8217;s a way 
  of being in the world, and from that &#8220;being&#8221; so much is possible. 
  All you have to be is yourself&#8212;in all your magnificence.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><b>What does the world need in terms of leadership?</b></p>
<p>Well, it would seem pretty obvious that the current forms of leadership in 
  the world are not serving us too well, so I guess the answer is something new.<br>
  <br>
  My dream is that there will come a time when the world will recognise the true 
  nature of what it is to be a fully alive human being&#8212;and respect that 
  in such a way that people and everything that inhabits our planet Earth can 
  truly live in harmony. For me, this is a return to our natural state, the way 
  we are meant to be in the world&#8212;aware, alive, sensing, feeling, spiritual, 
  communal beings. I know that sounds idealistic or idyllic or unreal AND I make 
  no apologies for that. The current state of the world and our way of being in 
  it fills me with fear for our future and for our children&#8217;s futures. And 
  that is where I feel there is a need for leaders to make a stand. This is what 
  the world needs from the new leaders: an alternative, a choice, a different 
  way of being, a belief in the sacredness of humanity and the world.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><b>What impact is possible?</b></p>
<p> That will depend on how brave we are&#8212;and how many of us are prepared 
  to take a stand for an alternative way. Our impact will be felt in the world 
  when we choose to live our lives as leaders&#8212;not followers. And the impact 
  will be felt at home in our families and among our friends and in our communities. 
  It will be felt wherever we choose to &#8220;show up&#8221; as leaders. The 
  impact I want to have is to challenge people to question &#8220;the way it is&#8221; 
  and allow them the freedom to see &#8220;the way it might be.&#8221; I want 
  to allow them a glimpse of an alternative way of being in the world, a way that 
  makes them feel great to be alive, to rejoice in the prospect of abundance and 
  choice and ease. A way that allows them to connect with the &#8220;oneness&#8221; 
  that unites us all in every moment.<br>
  <br>
  My future self is &#8220;Brave WaveMaker,&#8221; and if I am to make waves that 
  impact the world, I need to start by making some ripples. I believe I am beginning 
  to do that. The waves will follow.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><b>What keeps us from stepping into leadership?</b></p>
<p>The crunch question after all the fine words.<b> </b>What stops us from action?</p>
<p> Fear. <br>
  <br>
  Fear of taking responsibility, fear of being wrong, fear of being laughed at, 
  fear of making the effort, fear of losing what we have, fear of fear.</p>
<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<p><b>It&#8217;s not easy, is it?</b></p>
<p> It&#8217;s so much easier to leave it to someone else&#8212;to other people 
  who are more&#8230;more committed than I&#8230;braver than I&#8230;more capable 
  than I am. There&#8217;s always a good reason why now is not the right time 
  to step up and be the leader we yearn to be.<br>
  <br>
  And my final thought on that is something that I learned in the meadow at The 
  Mother Tree. It went something like this: For me&#8212;and perhaps you too&#8212;the 
  thought of &#8220;being a leader&#8221; can be weighed down with thoughts of 
  struggle and effort and of burden and pain. No wonder it can be hard to step 
  into. There is an alternative thought process that can make it light and joyous, 
  easy and painless. It is this: Stepping into my leadership role is as simple 
  as being me&#8212;all of me. When I can do that, I can let go of all the hardship 
  and slowly, step by small step, begin to make the difference that I know the 
  world is crying out for.</p>
