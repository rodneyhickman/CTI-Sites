<h1 class="style1">  Italian Cannoli and the Energetic Secrets of Getting More Clients </h1>
<p class="style6">Most of the tourists in Vernazza on the Italian Cinque Terra dine on the umbrella-laden patios overlooking the harbor. A few lucky visitors stumble, usually by strong word-of-mouth recommendation, onto the Il Pirata Restaurant in its unfortunate location far up beyond the village&rsquo;s train station. However they find it, these fortunate souls are in for a memorable cultural and culinary experience they will not soon forget. And if they were coaches, they might also learn a thing or two about marketing.</p>
<p class="style6">The Il Pirata is a small pastry/coffee shop and restaurant run by brothers Massimo and Lucca. Lucca runs the kitchen, where each day he creates a heavenly array of Italian pastries the way his mother taught him in the family&rsquo;s Sicilian bakery. (His cannoli desserts are worth the trip to Europe alone.) </p>
<p class="style6">Massimo anchors the coffee bar out front where he enthusiastically greets every patron. Each female visitor is met with a sincere &ldquo;H<em>ello Beautiful</em>&rdquo;&mdash;his direct translation of the informal Italian phrase <em>&ldquo;Ciao Bella.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="style6">Enthusiastic doesn&rsquo;t quite capture all of Massimo. In the first minute of contact with any client he has communicated three things:</p>
<ul class="style6">
  <li>He is delighted you are there.</li>
  <li>He finds you beautiful, in a non-threatening, non-suggestive, genuinely appreciative way, that has 70-year-old retired school-marms beaming in seconds and even the most travel-hardened skeptic smiling in minutes. </li>
  <li>His brother&rsquo;s pastries are the best in all of Italy. (If you ever find a better one, call him and he&rsquo;ll give you your money back.)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">It is as much a delight to eat their food as it is to observe Massimo, with periodic back up from Lucca, interact with customers. And even though the local land-owning merchants restrict these &ldquo;Sicilian upstarts&rdquo; to operating well out of the high traffic main drag of Vernazza, their business thrives.</p>
<p class="style6">So what can Italian pastry makers teach us about marketing a coaching practice? Three things: rapport, confidence, enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="style7" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Rapport</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Many of us are still struggling to sell coaching as some intangible, fuzzy service that we assume&mdash;with a zippy description and a little hand-waving&mdash;our potential clients will leap at the chance to spend $300 to $500 a month, on an open-ended basis. (Some may, but most won&rsquo;t.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6">Coaching is still too young for this. Less than 1 in 1,000 people have ever tried it. Too many clients simply don&rsquo;t know how to choose a coach, what you would use a coach for, and what the benefits of working with a coach might be. To spend serious money on a new service, clients really need to know that it is going to give them something of great value. And how do you, the coach, know what your potential clients might value, unless you have developed some rapport with them?</p>
<p class="style6">It is through learning what clients want to change in their lives, careers and businesses (and learning how important those outcomes are to them), that we can begin to package our coaching services as <u>a means</u> to help clients achieve the results they value. </p>
<p class="style6">Everybody has challenges, changes, dreams and goals that are important to them. Many potential clients would be willing to spend a lot of money to resolve these important issues, if they only knew that coaching was the best way to do it.</p>
<p class="style6">To find out what a qualified prospect (a potential client that is open to coaching and could actually afford to hire you) might be willing to spend money on, you need to do some research, and you have to get them to a point where they know, like, trust and value you. You need to develop a rapport with them.</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Confidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Anyone who has experienced good coaching, knows its power. Coaching doesn&rsquo;t just get results; it gets meaningful results. Compared to any other modality of training or development, coaching is hugely successful. ICF studies show that 83% of all clients stay with their coach for more than three months. The average coaching relations last six to eight months. The first client satisfaction survey the ICF ever did showed that 98.5% of clients were satisfied with their coaching experience. By any measure, coaching is a very successful service.</p>
<p class="style6">Yet many struggling coaches timidly engage potential prospects as if rather than offering a opportunity to sample a life- and career-altering experience, they were trying to sell their old Milli Vanilli records. There is often a &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t mean to bother you, but if it isn&rsquo;t too much trouble, I was wondering if you might possibly be interested in my coaching services&rdquo;</em> wimpishness to the selling offer. Doubt- and anxiety-ridden, these Level 1 approaches immediately tip off the prospect that even the coach has doubts about this new service. </p>
<p class="style6">If you don&rsquo;t believe in your ability to create value for a client, forget trying to sell your services. You can&rsquo;t fake true confidence. You actually have to believe. </p>
<p class="style6">Note to Gremlins: One of the most common marketing roadblocks for coaches is the<em> &ldquo;I am not a perfect coach yet&rdquo;</em> gremlin. Please. This may be a legitimate concern in the first few months of your training, but by then most coaches can add a great deal of value to their clients. So stop letting gremlins run your marketing campaign and have a little faith in yourself, your coaching school and your natural ability to be of use. Remember courage is not the absence of fear, it is the ability to do what needs to get done, even though you are scared. And never forget that this world desperately needs more good coaching. </p>
<p class="style7" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Enthusiasm </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Coaches know how badly people ache for the experience of being more engaged in their lives, careers and businesses. And as we all seek to find ways to be more fully alive, we are drawn to those who are full of enthusiasm (from the Greek <em>entheos</em>&mdash;full of spirit).</p>
<p class="style6">Genuine and natural enthusiasm is wildly infectious. It is wildly important in marketing your coaching business. When you finally walk through your <em>&ldquo;not good enough yet&mdash;I can&rsquo;t take rejection&rdquo;</em> gremlins and realize that the service you offer is valuable and will powerfully change the lives of your clients, you might find genuine cause to get a little excited. And moving from the previously described <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to bother you&hellip;&rdquo;</em> approach to one that is the energetic equivalent of <em>&ldquo;Coaching will create value for you&hellip;you really have to try this,&rdquo; </em>makes a huge difference.</p>
<p class="style6">It is the difference between marketing from a place of fear versus marketing from a place of having your heart fully engaged, believing that what you do is important to the world, and really going after the life you are trying to create&mdash;unattached to whether any particular client is going to recognize the value in your offer.</p>
<p class="style6">When you really commit to going after something with enthusiasm, in some mysterious way, the universe conspires to help you. Unexpected people and opportunities arrive in your life. It is as if you are hoisting your sail up into some unseen celestial wind that will push you further toward your destiny.</p>
<p class="style7" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Getting From Here to There</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Few of us possess the ability to change behavior as a result of knowledge alone. We can&rsquo;t just decide, <em>&ldquo;OK, I will now, in all circumstances, act with full confidence and enthusiasm.&rdquo;</em> However, maintaining awareness and intention is one of the most magical and powerful elixirs of the coaching process. If you are struggling with something, like your marketing, it is simply a sign that there is growth waiting to happen. For most coaches that growth entails stoking the forces that pull you forward, say, creating a compelling vision for your practice, or re-establishing a deep connection to the passion with which you are called to do this work. While at the same time managing the doubts, fears and old habits (gremlin stuff) that prevent you from getting where you want to go.</p>
<p class="style6">Successfully managing these forces is a day-to-day process that is helped by any reflective activity that keeps you in touch with your awareness and intention&mdash;meditation, contemplation, yoga, long peaceful walks, hot baths, etc. (Basically, whatever works to slow down your brain and bring you back in touch with the present moment, and the creative and causative power of your passion and intuitive wisdom.)</p>
<p class="style6">If you are present and aware, you are more likely to be at choice, and less likely to get swept away back to old, automatic and counterproductive (from a marketing perspective) behaviors. In these matters, growth is mandatory. It is only the struggle that is optional.</p>
<p class="style7" style="margin-bottom: 0;">SW Cubed</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">Finally, in your training, you probably heard the selling axiom that when you offer coaching to clients in hope of a positive reply, some will accept your offer of service and some won&rsquo;t. So what? If you manage the energy around the rapport you develop with your clients, the confidence with which you offer your services to the world, and do it all with the genuine enthusiasm that is a dividend of doing what your are meant to do in the world, you will see things change in your coaching business&mdash;quicker than you can say&nbsp; holy cannoli. </p>
