<h1>Staff Profile Joyce Wong</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0607/joyce2.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="2" align="right" />Joyce Wong is CTI&rsquo;s Customer Service/Operations  Administrator&mdash;<em>say that 10 times in a row  real fast! </em>Her lovely voice greets many a new student, and her  behind-the-scenes work keeps our whole office running smoothly. In her own words  (and revealing her passion for cooking), Joyce says, &ldquo;If CTI were a meatloaf,  I&rsquo;d be the breadcrumbs.&rdquo; She holds us all together, not only in her sub-role of  CTI mother, but in her operations role as well.</p>
<p>Joyce was born on Tuesday, December 15, which she says, &ldquo;is  a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&hellip;,&rdquo; though ironically Joyce is  actually a San Francisco native and  was born in St. Francis Hospital in the heart of San    Francisco.</p>
<p>The first job Joyce ever had was working for her dad at the  family grocery store, stocking the shelves. She was 8 years old at the time. While  in high school, she worked in a warehouse for a retail department store. After  college, she did a stint as a health educator for a family planning clinic. Eventually,  Joyce made her way to The Sierra Club, where she worked in Member Services under  the guidance of Jim Patterson. When Jim moved on to CTI, he contacted Joyce  when CTI needed some administrative support. At that time, she had just decided  to go back to work part-time after being a stay-at-home mom for three years, so it  worked out perfectly.</p>
<p>At CTI, Joyce works very closely with the database and  making sure the information gets inputted and uploaded for our courses and  student records. She provides backup support for student registrations, and  post course administrative follow-up for our international and corporate course  offerings. She says, &ldquo;That means I have lots of piles of paper on my desk!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Joyce&rsquo;s favorite aspect of the job she does is talking to  different people each day, and having the connections with students and  leaders. Her favorite thing about working at CTI is the staff. She enjoys  knowing that the staff is really happy about working for CTI. She also enjoys  the great location and the free parking! She&rsquo;s an ESFJ on the Myers Briggs  Personality indicator and says that, &ldquo;Being an extrovert helps when I talk to  so many people every day.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  The biggest aha Joyce has discovered about herself since she  started working at CTI is that she doesn&rsquo;t have to beat herself up if she  fails, but she also knows that no one is better than her when it comes to  bottom lining, getting things done, and seeing different perspectives. The  things she can&rsquo;t quite get the hang of?&nbsp;  Figuring out how to set the postage meter and un-jamming the printer!</p>
<p>Joyce brings her job home in more ways than one. She does  work part-time from home, but she also loves to be Co-Active whenever she can.  She says, &ldquo;I love talking to different people in different places and learning  about their lives. I love being Co-Active with my family, especially my nieces  and nephews, who, I&rsquo;ve been told, consider me the &lsquo;cool Aunt.&rsquo;&rdquo; She also knows  how to relax at home. When Joyce has completed a demanding project, she likes  to celebrate by sitting in front of the TV with her latest knitting project and  getting lost in a movie.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  The last and most important thing to know about Joyce is  that she is an Eccentric on the &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; typing scale, which means she enjoys  being different. Could that be why Joyce says, &ldquo;I have a warped sense of  humor&rdquo;? We think so, and we love her for it. She makes us laugh!</p>
