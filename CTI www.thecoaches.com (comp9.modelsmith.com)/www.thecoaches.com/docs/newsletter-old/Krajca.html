<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>The 7 Ways Process: Try-Storming Your Life</strong></h1>
<p>What do you get when you combine engineering experience, Japanese continuous-improvement philosophies and life coaching? About a month ago, I may have answered that question with the same look I had when trying sushi for the first time. (It wasn&rsquo;t very pretty!) As a recent full-time coach, I struggled to find a way to integrate the decade- long education and experience of being a manufacturing engineer with a totally new career as a coach. Many new coaches may be asking, &ldquo;How do we stay true to who we are and yet integrate past career experiences that may be completely separate from coaching?&rdquo; For me, the question became: &ldquo;What would it be like to apply the powerful and playful pre-production workshop experiences I encountered as a manufacturing engineer towards people&rsquo;s lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a co-leader for several product development workshops within the Boeing Company, we received guidance under the Shingijutsu consulting company of Japan. The consultants were lean manufacturing and continuous-improvement gurus from the successful Toyota Production System that began out-producing, out-selling and out-optimizing American-made cars throughout the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s. Looking back on the experience, the pre-production workshops were playful, fun and yielded impressive results in a short amount of time. </p>
<p>The Shingijutsu Company developed a relatively simple formula to bring a team of people together with a specific objective: create a safe environment for creativity and play, allow time to &ldquo;try-storm&rdquo; or develop ideas by playing with full-scale or mock-up sized models, report-out to management, and then continue the implementation process. They encouraged teams to throw out unnecessary rules that added cost or slowed down the process. They encouraged out-of-the box thinking and challenged members to &ldquo;look to nature&rdquo; for creative ideas. They encouraged the concept of &ldquo;moonshining&rdquo; (working under the cover of darkness so that nay-sayers would not interfere) and they also encouraged repeated follow-up for success.</p>
<p>By applying a lot of these very similar concepts, I have found it to be quite enjoyable when applied to Co-Active coaching situations. It can also be applied to any level of the client&rsquo;s agenda or focus, from high-level life visioning, mid-level focusing on major life areas (career, finances, relationships, fun/recreation, personal growth, etc.), on down to detailed focus on specific issues (i.e., I want to make up with my spouse/partner, I want to ask my boss for a raise, etc.).</p>
<p>The 7 Ways Process includes the following basic steps:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li><strong>Create and define an area of focus.</strong> Be as specific as possible so you know what level and area of your life you are focusing on.</li>
  <li><strong>Perspective-storm.</strong> Creatively brainstorm how you want to feel or what you want the results to look like by <em>sketching</em> (you do not need to be an artist!). By sketching and not using words, you are encouraged to be more creative. If you can sketch out your idea and other people can understand it, then it will be very clear to implement later in the try-storming phase. Be as creative as possible and look to nature for solutions. For example, I may want to approach my boss for a raise. One concept could be to approach him as a lion! The most important step is to <em>create at least seven concepts</em>! Why? Because seven is one more than six. Be as creative and wild as possible right now. Don&rsquo;t let that gremlin hold you small!</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluate your seven ways to the top three.</strong> You will actually go out and &ldquo;try&rdquo; these three concepts in your life. I have created my own evaluation matrix and some of the elements include: &ldquo;aliveness&rdquo; of the concept, matching values, matching talents, resources needed, costs to implement, &ldquo;ease&rdquo; factor and more. </li>
  <li><strong>Try-storm your top three</strong>! Try-storming is just that. The idea is that the planning stage is miniscule to actually going out into the world and &ldquo;doing&rdquo; or acting on your top three concepts. You are encouraged to go out and moonshine&mdash;avoid the nay-sayers&mdash;and do what feels right to you!</li>
  <li><strong>Reevaluate, combine, or recreate concepts as you go.</strong> Just keep playing until you get there. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to morph together earlier concepts as you learn by trying.</li>
  <li><strong>Report-out and celebrate!</strong> Let the world know what you learned and achieved. Then determine how you will celebrate what you have accomplished.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous improvement.</strong> This is where the client has the choice to keep refining their area of focus or continue applying this process to a new area of focus.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">The 7 Ways Process is a fun and playful way for you or your clients to implement a vision or change that you want in your lives. I highly encourage anyone that wants to play or learn more about this process to please join the teleconference scheduled for Tuesday October 18, 2005 from 10:30 a.m.-noon. This event is on the Main Community Calendar. Good luck to all of us as we learn to show up genuinely with our clients, combine our broad depth of experience and knowledge, and help others to play and show up big in their lives!</p>
