<h1> How to Build a Thriving Coaching Business: Create Alliances </h1>
<p>When we first start out on the road to success as a coach, we usually walk 
  alone. We have high hopes and a clear and brilliant dream of where we are going. 
  But then the taxes come due, and the computer crashes, and your mother gets 
  ill and your car won't start. All of a sudden that big dream loses all of its 
  air and starts to deflate. You are in danger of heading for the Want Ads, or 
  Monster.com, in search of a tiny but reliable paycheck. </p>
<p>When you own your own business, lots of time, money and energy are required 
  to create a business that is thriving and successful. There may be some new 
  things to handle that may not be familiar to some of you who have not before 
  worked for yourselves. Some things might get dropped in the process—like your 
  family, your finances, your friends, your taxes, etc. You have to find a way 
  to handle logistics in your life as effectively as you handle the critical aspects 
  of your business to ensure both the sustainability of your business and your 
  life. But how? </p>
<p>If you hate numbers, you will hate your own bookkeeping. If you hate schedules, 
  you will lose your Palm Pilot. If you hate to answer the phone, clients will 
  drop through the cracks. I have watched many coaches stress themselves out and 
  work their “fingers to the bone” to create a thriving coaching practice, only 
  to find that they get overworked, underpaid and give up because they run out 
  of energy. Instead of starting some massive self-improvement program, what about 
  asking for a little help? Find someone who loves to do what you hate. Get help 
  by creating alliances in those areas where you have deficits. </p>
<p>So, how many of you out there have a hard time asking for help and creating 
  alliances that support you? I know that for some of you, asking for help may 
  be a challenge. I know it was a challenge for me! I thought I could do it all 
  by myself and didn't need any help. Boy, was I wrong! (OK…I know…“Nobody gets 
  to be wrong, including me” AND I did make a mistake!) What I discovered was 
  that it was essential as an entrepreneur and coach to create and design alliances 
  that would support me in my business and my life. Here are some areas of your 
  business and your life around which you may need to create alliances: </p>
<p>1. Accountant/Bookkeeper—Get someone to help you keep your numbers straight 
  so you can focus on your business! </p>
<p>2. Coach/Mentor Coach—Get a coach to help you work on one particular part of 
  your business with you; get another coach to help you with the life stuff that 
  you need to get a better handle on, such as relationships, for example. </p>
<p>3. Family—Ask your family to pitch in to help get things done around the house, 
  such as shopping, housework, etc. </p>
<p>4. Attorney—Get a list of attorneys for such help with tax accounting, partnership 
  agreements, drawing up incorporation documents, real estate ventures, etc. As 
  your business grows, so will the need for attorneys to assist you in making 
  sound business decisions in relationship to the law. </p>
<p>5. Personal Assistant/Virtual Assistant—Hire a part-time or full-time personal 
  assistant or virtual assistant to help you do all those little tasks that are 
  important but may be too time-consuming for you as the business owner to be 
  taking on constantly, such as: inputting data into your database of potential 
  clients, typing letters and picking up business cards, for example. </p>
<p>6. Web Designer/Graphic Artist—These people are extremely helpful in getting 
  you a website designed, your business cards designed, marketing your website 
  and services, etc. Get referrals and check out a couple of different people 
  before you hire. The time taken to research the designer's ability and expertise 
  will pay off in the end! </p>
<p>7. Accountability Group—One way I know to get the important things done in 
  your business is to place yourself in an accountable environment with people 
  who will support you in moving forward in your business. While your coach may 
  help you focus on staying in balance and deepening your learning about yourself, 
  an accountability group will help you stay on track in your business. Join an 
  accountability group that focuses primarily on you building your business. Myfullpractice.com 
  offers small accountability groups to help you keep on track regarding your 
  business. Email me to find out more about these groups to get your business 
  to the next level! </p>
<p>Lastly, please remember that creating good alliances and hiring the right people 
  to assist and support you takes time. It isn't done just once. The alliances 
  you need will change as your business grows and changes. Start building your 
  team today! Take a look now at your business and make a commitment to ask for 
  support and help in one or all of the areas listed above. Your business will 
  prosper and you will succeed in the long term! <br>
