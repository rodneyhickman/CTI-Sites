<p><img src="http://www.thecoaches.com/epub/theInquiry/0605/oliya.jpg" width="100" height="155" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />Oliya Temnikoff is a Senior Accountant here at The Coaches  Training Institute, and is among those who have been here from the early stages  of the growth of this company. She is extremely charming (a Charm type on the I  Am typing scale), and can woo anyone by batting her eyelashes and smiling her  warm smile. She brings a lot of life and style to the Accounting Department,  and we would not be the same without her. Here&rsquo;s a little more about who she  is.</p>
<p>Oliya was born in<strong> </strong>a beautiful resort area on the Black Sea  in Russia. She was born on September 20, 1973, on the Virgo/Libra cusp&mdash;which  makes her the perfect person to handle our details and do the checking and  balancing that accounting requires! She started her career as an accountant in  1990 in Russia, where she worked in several different corporations before she  came to America in 1996. In the year 2000, she got an offer two weeks from the  time she found an ad in the <em>Marin  Independent Journal</em> about a position in the accounting department at CTI.  She had no idea at the time that The Coaches Training Institute was about life  coaching. Now she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned more about it and taking the courses  helped me in my personal growth. I&rsquo;m so happy that I was able to find not only  a job, but also friends here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliya is an ISFJ on the Myers-Brigg&rsquo;s Personality Type  Indicator, which might explain why she feels that &ldquo;doing accounting is like  playing with puzzles.&rdquo; Sounds like she loves her job! Her favorite thing about  working at CTI is that she loves working for a company whose primary focus is  on goals of a humanitarian nature. She is also going through constant personal  and professional growth, herself, which is very important to her.</p>
<p>Her favorite way to celebrate an accomplished job is with  her department. She says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a tradition in accounting to acknowledge  each others accomplishments. It&rsquo;s great to have support during the time I&rsquo;m  working on the project and also to celebrate completion of it together.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp; </strong>This  is a very Co-Active way to celebrate,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>as far as being Co-Active on the job  is concerned, Oliya feels it is being aware of one  another&rsquo;s needs and personality, and being in constant communication and  creative collaboration with each other.</p>
<p>The biggest <em>aha</em> that Oliya has discovered about herself since she started working at CTI is  that, &ldquo;No one gets to be wrong. This applies to me, too. None of us is perfect  and that&rsquo;s OK. There is always a room for improvement.&rdquo; But that is not how she  feels about her salsa dancing! She says nobody is better than her at dancing  salsa, and she makes a request: &ldquo;Does anybody want to compete with me?&rdquo; But she  is only partly serious and mostly joking when she says this. Be careful,  though, she might just charm you into joining her, even if you have no idea  what you are doing!</p>

  <li><strong>What is your favorite food/recipe?</strong>&nbsp; I       love cooking borsh. I don&rsquo;t like when cooks put too much of strong spices       like cinnamon and rosemary. I like delicate smell and taste.</li>
