<h1> Gremlin! You Mean You Lied to Me All This Time?</h1>
<p> You see, I&#8217;ve had this Gremlin for a companion, lo, these many years. 
  He tells me I&#8217;m not creative. I&#8217;m many other wonderful things, but 
  I&#8217;m not creative! AND I BELIEVED HIM! I admit it, I did.<br>
  <br>
  I spent close to five years taking CTI courses, Certification, Leadership, Business 
  Development Program, BDP Leader Training. I had several wonderful coaches (and 
  still have one, of course) who encouraged me in every way possible to dump that 
  Gremlin. Many friends have told me, &#8220;What do you mean, you&#8217;re not 
  creative? That&#8217;s clearly not true. Look at this, that and the other thing 
  you created!&#8221; But did I believe them? You guessed that right.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, my erstwhile companion continued his annoying murmuring in my ear, 
  &#8220;They were just being nice, after all. No, you&#8217;re not creative like 
  so and so. You can&#8217;t draw, you don&#8217;t think up ideas at the drop 
  of a hat. You should write articles, but really you don&#8217;t want to. Because 
  what would you say, anyway, huh? (Actually, he says &#8220;eh,&#8221; being 
  as we&#8217;re both Canadian.) And who would want to read it even if you wrote 
  something? Oh sure, you won the prize in Grade XI for the best original short 
  story, but that was Beginner&#8217;s Luck. And that was then, such a very long 
  time ago, and this is now!&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  But that WAS then, and this is NOW! And this morning, a magical thing happened. 
  A &#8220;<i>confluence</i>&#8221; of events. (I love that word, confluence: 
  &#8220;A place where two rivers meet; a coming together.&#8221; &#8212;Oxford 
  English Dictionary)<br>
  <br>
  <b>Event #1:</b> I attended The Call Retreat last month, where we learned to 
  &#8220;move energy&#8221; and did so every day for four days in fun and surprising 
  ways. Something shifted in me.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Event #2:</b> I was leading a discussion with a Women&#8217;s Group I recently 
  started (called Women Living Out Loud!&#8230; Hello! I created that!) on how 
  you notice your intuition, how it shows up&#8212;if you pay attention. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Event #3:</b> The word &#8220;muse&#8221; kept crossing my path in different 
  ways the last few weeks, and I chose to pay attention!<br>
  <br>
  <b>Event #4:</b> My day cleared unexpectedly today, and I had already cleaned 
  up my desk and my Outlook Inbox last weekend. No more reasons to procrastinate.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Event #5:</b> I took to my bubble bath, the one place where I have discovered 
  that ideas miraculously pop into my head. <br>
  <br>
  I wasn&#8217;t too sure for awhile where to start, what to write about, who 
  to write it for. And then the idea popped in to write this article just for 
  fun, and not be attached to the outcome. As the bubbles subsided, I realized 
  that ye old Gremlin had been lurking beneath, so decided to let him leave by 
  the drain along with the bathwater. Miraculously, another idea came, and another, 
  and another. <br>
  <br>
  And I am having such a good time now, that I just want to keep writing and writing 
  and writing and writing&#8230;. Excuse me, I have another article to begin.
