<h1><strong>Tools for  Visioning</strong></h1>
<p>Relax, take a few deep breaths and feel the tension of the  day leaving your body. When you are ready, close your eyes and see  yourself&hellip;wait a minute&hellip;if you close your eyes, you won't be able to read how to  use visioning to support yourself and your clients! Please, keep breathing, let  your tension go, and let&rsquo;s explore the benefits of visioning together. </p>
<p>I am a visionary. I see possibilities for myself and my  clients almost effortlessly&mdash;this is intrinsically who I am. I'm a Soul Type 7,  an entrepreneur, a woman that sees many possibilities. I have learned that we  are not all that way. Tools and structures are needed to turn on the telescope.  Because of my passion for vision, as well as my love for variety, I have a toy  box full of fun toys to play with that allow us to see and feel what is  possible. </p>
<p>Why is it even important to see what is possible? As early  as 1492, people were itching for more in their lives. Why did Christopher  Columbus sail the ocean blue? To see what else was out there! Our clients come  to us to see what is out there for them. Whether it is the next career move or  the possibility of being better in their current career, or seeing that there  is more available for them and their team to step into their greatness&mdash;they  sense, even if it is just a tiny itch, that something more is possible for  them. </p>
<p>I want to share a few of the tools that I use as Chief  Grower for <a href="http://www.passionfruitpeople.com/" target="_blank">Passionfruit Creative  Business Growers</a> to support people and business in full bloom. But before I  share those tools, I do want to mention how important it is for us as coaches  to have a clear vision of what we want to create and hold for ourselves. It is  a process to really gain clarity on this question. The process for me began  with getting crystal clear with my values. After that, I created a visual  representation of what it looked like. Yes, my friend, a beautiful collage is  what started the process of knowing what I wanted to create in my life. I build  and add on to this collage on a regular basis to keep me moving in the  direction that I desire. It is one of the many structures used in visioning,  and it is powerful! Whenever I look at my vision board and celebrate the  certainty that I am honoring what is most important to me at my core, my heart  sings. What is the vision you have for the impact you want to make in the  world?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vision boards were the impetus for creating one of my  visioning workshops: Imagine It! Create It! Live It!&trade; This workshop uses the power of  Visioning and Goal-Getting&trade;  to clarify our intentions and our life purpose. By starting with collaging and  breaking it into bite-sized pieces, I find that my clients experience more joy  on their journey of living their intentions and reaching their goals. Along  with the collage, I encourage them to come up with a theme that will be part of  their structure for this process.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the theme becomes clear, we determine what the theme song  will be. This is definitely my favorite part of the workshop! The tears flow  from laughter and joy, as well as the heartfelt melodies that people share with  the group. We dance and sing and truly feel the theme in our heart and soul. I  am conscious of touching different learning styles during this process: visual  collages, audio songs and the somatic part of singing and dancing, as well as  sharing what happens in between gatherings in their Vision Teams. I continue to  weave their themes, intentions and songs throughout the rest of the workshop.</p>
<p>As you can see from the start of this journey, I also use  visualizations. Don&rsquo;t you love the power of a good visualization? Being able to  take your client on a journey and never having their body leave the room&mdash;unless  it does! I find the most valuable part of this type of activity is leaving  plenty of time for debriefing to ask rich questions that allow them to continue  their sensory journey. &ldquo;What did your body tell you about this experience? How  will that support you on integrating this into your life? What will it taste  like, smell like, etc.?&rdquo; We continue to weave these juicy tidbits from this  journey into our coaching sessions. </p>
<p>Often, when I complete with clients, I create a  visualization designed for them. If we &ldquo;go to the beach,&rdquo; I will give them a  shell. If we &ldquo;go to the mountains,&rdquo; I will give them a rock. The feedback I  receive from them regarding this small gift as a structure has been wonderful. </p>
<p>One of my favorite visioning tools in our Discovery Journey  is The Future Letter. I ask my clients to pick someone in their life that they  feel comfortable sharing with. They then write a letter dated one, five, 10 or  20 years from today&rsquo;s date and share all that they have accomplished and become  over that time. It is amazing how we can determine an agenda, intentions and  heart-felt desires from this simple, yet powerful exercise. This becomes a  foundation for our coaching relationship. We review the letter every two months  or so, to not only celebrate successes, but also to reveal the next place to  focus our time and energy in actualizing this vision.</p>
<p>Thank you for allowing me to share some of the toys that I  play with that allow my clients to discover and live their passion. I have  always enjoyed sharing my toys and have been told I play well with others&mdash;have  fun and live your vision!</p>
