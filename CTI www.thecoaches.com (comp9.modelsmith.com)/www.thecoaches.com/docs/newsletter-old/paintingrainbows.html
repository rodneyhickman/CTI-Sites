<h1>Painting Rainbows</h1>
<p>To understand why diversity is important we need look no further than Miss Mother Nature. In nature, there is a smorgasbord of diversity, a feast of difference. Diversity is valuing difference, it is seeing all of the colors of the rainbow and loving and celebrating each one. In the rainbow, the color red has no more inherent value than blue. Can you imagine a rainbow without the color yellow? It would be incomplete. Each color is needed to create the magic called the rainbow. </p>
<p>I think of diversity as summoning rainbows&mdash;as painting rainbows. What do you need to do when you are going to paint a rainbow? Why, you go and get all the colors. You collect them, assemble them and then you begin painting. Sometimes you paint each color individually, and sometimes you blend them. Red and blue, blended together, create a completely new color, a new experience. Have you ever been inspired by the color purple?</p>
<p>Communities of color will respond to the notion of coaching when the coaching community reaches out to them, directly. When the Black Professional Coaches Alliance was first founded, we simply asked the question, &ldquo;Where is the color Black? Where do we find the beautiful shades of brown from pale golden, to the deepest chocolate? Where do we find them?&rdquo; We then took this question to heart, and began identifying large African-American professional organizations. We literally took it &ldquo;to the streets&rdquo; reaching out to our target market of African Americans. We have spoken to thousands of people in our community with a targeted message that helps the audience see the relevance of coaching to their lives. Additionally, we framed our message in a way that spoke directly to the African-American experience. We invoked the 400 years of mental conditioning that has been prevalent in the African-American community. We then described coaching as a lever that would intervene in the conditioning cycle. We continued to refine the message so that it landed in the hearts and souls of our audience. </p>
<p>The BPCA has taken this seed of an idea and created strategic partnerships with several African-American national professional associations. It is our way of gaining access to vast numbers of individuals, in a highly leveraged way. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we took a team of coaches to the largest African-American networking conference in the country and offered free coaching sessions. We coached well over 300 people in a three-day period. What we know is that many of those clients will have their lives transformed, and some of them will join the coaching community. Others will spread the word in the African-American community. We helped one woman jumpstart her business, and by the time she left the conference, she had raised more than $4,000 in startup money. We helped another person figure out the right steps in her career transition. We helped another gentleman get clear that he needed to delegate more of the tasks that he hated to more of his team members. The net effect is that many people were transformed, and our coaches enrolled $30,000 worth of business. Inclusion makes good business sense, too. Communities of color are often large, untapped and underserved marketplaces. Sometimes the color yellow has to go and get the color yellow and say, &ldquo;Hey, come and join the rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can create more diversity in the coaching community by being infinitely curious about all the colors of the rainbow. If I am red, then I must get curious about the color yellow, if only so that I have a more complete human experience. I invite everyone in the Co-Active community to become the co-creators of rainbows. </p>
