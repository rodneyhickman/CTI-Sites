<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Incorporating Ritual Into Our Daily Lives</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I ponder the meaning of ritual in my life, it conjures up a few memories of my times as a schoolchild, participating in church/religion/worship. I was expected to attend mass every Friday with class. We would fast before service and then would have the same breakfast afterward, when we returned to the classroom. Another memory I have is every Saturday morning, I would get up at 6 a.m. and walk an hour to the bus stop where I would catch the transport to the stable where I would attend a horseback riding lesson. At the stable, we would groom, saddle and bridle the horses, walk them to the arena, display them for inspection and mount to ride and practice our latest lesson. This was the ritual the riding master had given us to do. We just thought they were rules!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thinking more about it, I realize that ritual permeates our whole life. For example, Sunday night dinners with family, graduations, scouts, football games, routine workdays, getting coffee before walking into the office, etc. What rituals have been evoked so far for you in your daily life now or growing up as a child? All of these memories involve action, desire, intention. By what force or inspiration are we motivated into this kind of action? Typically they are so much a part of us, we do not realize the habitual way in which we live our lives</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, what makes a ritual a ritual and why do we have it? We create it all the time! We do so to create a memory, a routine and perhaps a way of life, but for me, the answer to that question is passion and the desire for connection. It is also the desire for the spiritual aspect of life to be brought into the physical realm through ritual. Passion is an intense driving force, motivating me to create and enact certain actions to create a certain environment or desired result. For example, I may light a candle and incense at the beginning and end of each day to draw separation of night to day and day to night. This also serves to signify beginning and end of work-day routines giving rise to more focused time with family, friends or self. The purpose of passion and ritual is to supply one with an unwavering, driving force toward the union, reunion or realization of one's divine being and the courage to look deep within oneself without judgment. Its purpose is to clearly see the motivation behind one's actions and thoughts, so that one can attain the best step forward toward the realization of enlightenment in this present lifetime.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my daily routine, I use sage and incense for a specific purpose of cleansing. Before I get out of bed, I claim the day with intention. There is an altar in my home on which I place items of interest to me or my clients. These act as intentions placed within the altar space. Before I begin my coaching day, I focus on these items, these intentions and requests and the humans or the souls who contributed them. I then connect and offer them to the higher power (insert your desired higher power here). What results, for me, is a mindfulness and connectedness with my clients which has me in greater service to them and the whole of life, daily!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to Wikipedia, A ritual is a formalized, predetermined set of symbolic actions generally performed in a particular environment at a regular, recurring interval. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual) Some smoke a ritual pipe upon gathering with friends. Some share fruit, bread and/or wine as a symbolic ritual for the purpose of connection, community and sharing. Tools, such as the aforementioned altar or ritual pipe, are commonly used. Many have origins in the martial arts or warfare, such as athames or purbas. Many tools are found in everyday living landscapes like flowers, plants, wooden branches for wands, or crystals found in the earth. One could also use the form of water flowing as expressed in art. The placement of items on an altar, breathing intentionally and meditation are other actions that can be used in ritual. With every breath and step we take, we create the opportunity to reach inside toward the indivisible and visible wholeness of our divine being. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ritual causes one to embrace all of life, including its challenges, rather than suppressing them. It creates intention, mindfulness, focus and purpose. This passion and desire begins or continues to inform us of the life lessons that need our attention. Pull the lesson out and examine it thoroughly without judgment. Utilize passion and desire as the driving force to come face to face with the illusion on your path toward enlightenment. What rituals do you create for yourself? What results when you participate in your created rituals? And, if you did not participate, what effect would there be in your life and in your being-ness? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I invite you to experiment and play with your own ritual&hellip;with passion! What you choose and how you choose to create your ritual is totally up to you.</p>
