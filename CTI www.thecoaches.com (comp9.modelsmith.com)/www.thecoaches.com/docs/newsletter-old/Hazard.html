<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Assessments: Stereotyping or Self-Discovering?</strong></h1>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><em>Mary Jo Hazard, MS, CPCC, PCC,</em></strong><em> has been using assessments in her life and her work since the mid 1980s and is a huge advocate of them and their value in coaching. This article describes her four preferred assessments and their benefits.</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Some naysayers dismiss the value of assessments: &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s gonna stereotype me!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unique, how can they put me in a box with a bunch of letters to describe me?&rdquo; I see assessments as a way to better understand ourselves so we can learn to live and work with others whose preferences may be very different from our own. Once we see more clearly, we can choose how to be proactive and how to respond to life. It&rsquo;s all about awareness and choice.</p>
<p>The MBTI&reg; (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&reg;) is the assessment I use most frequently. It measures people&rsquo;s preferences on four scales:&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
  <li>How we derive our energy (Extraversion/Introversion). </li>
  <li>How we gather information (Sensing, iNtuiting).</li>
  <li>How we make decisions (Thinking/Feeling).</li>
  <li>How we deal with our outer world (Judging/Perceiving). </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">When I start a coaching relationship, I ask in the welcome packet what the person&rsquo;s MBTI is and if they don&rsquo;t know, I ask them if they&rsquo;d like that to be a first step in our coaching. </p>
<p>Knowing someone&rsquo;s MBTI helps me serve them better and helps them with the self-discovery process. The Extraversion/Introversion score gives me clues about their desire for silence during a call, about their wanting to think out loud by talking things through and about how they renew themselves if they&rsquo;re feeling burned out. The Sensing/iNtuiting score gives me clues about communication: Do they prefer details or big picture? Do they prefer concrete or metaphor? Do they access their intuition? The Thinking/Feeling score is beneficial when the client is making a decision. What will work best: a logical and rational approach with a list of pros and cons, or looking at their values as a key decision factor and the impact of the decision on the important people in their lives? The Judging/Perceiving score suggests whether the client will want more or less structure in the coaching session and whether s/he will want to explore possibilities for several sessions or want more immediate closure on one option to select.</p>
<p>The MBTI is also a tremendous tool for those in career transition. Based on the client&rsquo;s type, they can access the research on which jobs/careers are best suited to their preferences. I typically suggest the book <em>Do What You Are</em>, by Paul Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger. Clients who use this resource find themselves responding with statements such as &ldquo;No wonder this job sucks,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeful that I can choose a career path that&rsquo;s more &lsquo;me&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other books I suggest for clients who want to learn more about type and its impact are short booklets with practical applications for the workplace. These books include <em>Intro to Type and Teams</em>, <em>Intro to Type and Organizations</em>, <em>Intro to Type and Conflict</em>, and <em>Intro to Type and Coaching</em>. All can be ordered for a nominal fee from Consulting Psychologists Press at <a href="http://www.cpp.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.cpp.com</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/" target="_blank"><u>www.myersbriggs.org</u></a> website has additional information on the assessment and its uses. A Myers-Briggs training program is required to administer this assessment, and there are many qualifying organizations from which to choose. My choice was Type Resources, <a href="http://www.type-resources.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.type-resources.com</u></a>. </p>
<p>A companion assessment to the MBTI is the FIRO-B&reg;, the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior&reg;. This assessment is particularly useful for individuals to discover how they relate with others in the areas of inclusion, control and affection. Unlike the MBTI, which indicates innate preferences, the FIRO-B is situational.&nbsp; Sometimes clients are baffled as to why they are not clicking with people at work or people in their personal lives, when it is often differing needs that is the issue. Once they are aware, they can choose behaviors that better suit both their own needs and the needs of the relationship. The FIRO-B, like the MBTI, is available from Consulting Psychologists Press, <a href="http://www.cpp.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.cpp.com</u></a>, and also requires a training course in order to administer.</p>
<p>The combination MBTI and FIRO-B assessments generate &ldquo;The Leadership Report.&rdquo; This is an extremely practical document that gives clients specifics about their leadership style and behavioral areas, such as communication, problem-solving and decision-making. By now you can probably surmise the contact organization for &ldquo;The Leadership Report&rdquo;&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cpp.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.cpp.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>The MBTI and FIRO-B can be used effectively in both life coaching and executive coaching. Another assessment that is a critical foundation for launching executive coaching is a 360 feedback tool. As its name implies, the 360 tool is given to multi-raters:&nbsp; supervisor, direct-reports, peers and the client him/herself. This tool measures an executive&rsquo;s performance in multiple areas, typically communication, leadership, strategy, decision-making, teamwork and problem-solving. Once I debrief the results of the tool with the executive, we look for patterns to emerge to populate a development plan, also referred to as a learning plan or action plan. This identifies two areas of focus for our coaching:&nbsp; a strength to maximize and a development opportunity. Much of the coaching post-360 is looking at successes and challenges with these focus areas.</p>
<p>These 360 assessments are produced by many organizations and require a certification program in order to administer. Two certifications I have earned are: Team Management Systems&rsquo; Linking Skills (<a href="http://www.tms.com.au/" target="_blank"><u>www.tms.com.au</u></a>) and The Hay Group Emotional Competence Inventory, which measures emotional intelligence skills (<a href="http://www.haygroup.com/" target="_blank"><u>www.haygroup.com</u></a>).</p>
<p>Over the years I have taken a variety of assessments and each time I learn more about myself and how I show up in the world, which I enjoy discovering! The four assessments I have detailed in this article are the ones I believe have the greatest reliability, validity and, most of all, greatest value for both my clients and me. </p>
<p>Isabel Briggs Myers sums up the benefits of assessments: &ldquo;Whatever the circumstances of your life, the understanding of (assessments) can make your perceptions clearer, your judgments sounder, and your life closer to your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
