<h1><strong>Product Development Land&mdash;Fasten Your Seat  Belt</strong></h1>
<p>What a wonderful  feeling to wake up, check your email and find messages declaring that you&rsquo;ve  just made a sale. Woohooo! That&rsquo;s one of the joys of passive income. Creating  your own product (or product line) is one way to bring in an additional revenue  stream. For those of you bursting with creative ideas, this may be the perfect  business strategy for you. The benefits go beyond profit to include branding,  reach and impact. Although the process to get there is far from passive, the  time, energy and money you invest are worth the effort. </p>
<p>I personally  favor products that you can hold in your hand. While tangible products  generally require a bigger investment of time and money, the end product is  highly portable and interactive. You also have a broad range of distribution  channels. Your product can, literally, go anywhere that your target market  hangs out: schools, businesses, hospitals, army bases, corporations, anywhere.  They can have amazing reach. Just to be clear, tangible products include such  things as card decks, board games, CDs, calendars, toys, books, magnets,  accessories, etc. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been  immersed in product development land for the past three years, and I want to  share a few of the important lessons I&rsquo;ve gained along the way. However, before  I go there, I want to invite you to take a moment to dream a little. Imagine  turning your passion into a product. Who would you like to impact? Imagine many  people interacting with it. This isn&rsquo;t just any product, but one that takes on  a life of its own and has broad appeal. Experience the excitement of creating  something that is so popular that trendy specialty shops have trouble keeping  it in stock. Imagine that it is so hot that mass-market retailers pick it up.  What an amazing way to bring coaching concepts to a huge audience. When it  comes to passive income, that level of distribution would be very healthy for  the bottom line. Visioning is actually an important step in the process. The  vision and passion you bring to your product idea has power and will get you  through the bumps along the way.</p>
<p>So now, let&rsquo;s  get down to the nitty gritty. For those venturing into creating products for  the first time, fasten your seat belt and expect big growth as you face some big  gulp moments. Investing in your idea and parting with your hard earned cash is  one of the biggest obstacles many face. Your success will absolutely require a  sufficient investment, whether it comes from you or an investor. Bottom line:  scrimping or cutting corners can actually cost you in the long run.</p>
<h2>Investment</h2>
<p>There are  investments to be made throughout the journey. You will need to invest in legal  protection, good design and adequate production. Parting with your money will  be easier if you have done some research and planning. It&rsquo;s so easy to get  enamored with a new idea and just dive in. As hard as it is to slow the process  down, it is really important to do so. Research your market, find out if they  want what you are creating, test your concept with them, test your design and  test your pricing. It&rsquo;s going to be way easier to invest if you know there will  be buyers. The other important thing to do is plan your marketing and  distribution strategy before you print or manufacture. Don&rsquo;t wait until you have  a living room full of product before you think about how to get it out into the  world. </p>
<h2>Hire  a Designer</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s really  smart to invest in a talented designer even if you have artistic ability  yourself. An experienced designer will be able to execute a variety of styles,  know what is expected in the marketplace and bring an objective eye to help you  build your brand. Even with my background in fine art and print advertising, I  knew enough to hire someone. Your best choice is to find someone who is both a  graphic designer and an art director. Art directors have relationships with  printers, illustrators and related professionals. They will be able to suggest  alternative formats and packaging options. They will know about standard  template sizes, available paper stock and press sizes. All of these things can  help you create your product in the most cost-efficient way. It&rsquo;s good to have  their input early in the process. I&rsquo;ve seen really great concepts fall flat  because of lack of design. Design really impacts perceived value, and if the  perceived value is low, the marketplace won&rsquo;t buy it or at least not at the  price you want to charge. We have a product on the Coaching Toys site that went  through a recent packaging re-design. The investment the author made has really  increased sales. To be honest, it wasn&rsquo;t selling at all before the new look,  even though it&rsquo;s a great product. Design matters. </p>
<h2>Take  Advantage of Price Breaks</h2>
<p>Great learning  comes from mistakes and we all make them. The mistake I made with my first product  was in not investing enough, even though the amount at the time seemed huge. I  didn&rsquo;t scrimp on quality (although this is a mistake many make); I did hold  back on quantity. I didn&rsquo;t print enough to take advantage of the price breaks  you get with quantity. </p>
<p>The cost of each  unit was so high I didn&rsquo;t have enough margin to sell wholesale. The biggest  wake up call came when I was contacted by a coach training program that wanted  to offer my product to their students and I didn&rsquo;t have enough margin to make  it worth their while. A tough lesson learned, and I don&rsquo;t want you to make the  same mistake. Fortunately for me, that product is a bestseller on the website.  My recommendation is to think bigger early in the process and explore what&rsquo;s  required from different distribution channels. For example, listing your  product in a catalog that has a large distribution might require you to have  1,200 on hand ready to ship. Could you meet that kind of request? Such a  catalog also takes 50%. Do you have the margin to allow you to do that? Think  of the visibility that kind of exposure will give your product. </p>
<h2>Creating Products as a Catalyst for Personal Growth</h2>
 <p> As you create products, be prepared for some interesting challenges to show up right on your  growing edge. Your product will call you to take a stand for something, to  become visible, to claim what you know, to trust your decision-making process,  to take risks, to accept feedback, to work through fears and limiting beliefs,  and the granddaddy of them all: to invest your hard earned cash. You will  stretch your capacity for confidence, creativity and courage, and it will bring  up lots of good stuff to work on with your coach.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Are you feeling  excited? Overwhelmed? A little scared? Can&rsquo;t wait to get moving? All of these  are normal responses along this journey. Although there is a learning curve,  there is help out there and a pool of people who have gone before you. Remember  to do your research, create a plan and invest enough to insure profitability. I  think we have barely begun to scratch the surface of what&rsquo;s possible in this  arena. You could be the one to create that product that takes coaching  mainstream. It&rsquo;s definitely do-able and well worth it!</p>
