<h1>Assessing the Team as a System</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Coaching a team is different than coaching individuals, and the difference goes well beyond the added complexity of numbers. The coach is working with a dynamic system with a life of its own that is greater than the working of the individual parts. This systems approach is at the heart of CTI&rsquo;s Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching curriculum, and the Stellar Team Diagnostic is built on an ORSC foundation. The theoretical background and interventions from ORSC are complemented by a practical team performance model, assessment tool and development support from Team Diagnostic. The two team resources are an ideal, synergistic match. </p>
<p><strong>What the assessment reveals</strong></p>
<p>The Stellar Team Model clearly defines the necessary strengths for sustainable, high-performing teams. Ultimately, teams exist to produce results. Research shows that the most successful teams have the means in place to take action (productivity) and they build effective relationships to motivate and maintain action (positivity). The Stellar Team model is built on these two fundamental axes: factors that optimize productivity and factors that promote positivity. Having the resources and expertise, or the tools and material is not enough to achieve outstanding results without a high level of positive engagement. The model defines seven separate productivity factors and seven positivity factors. Together, these 14 strengths represent a complete constellation of strengths that are essential in order for a team to be both high performing and sustainable. </p>
<p>A high productivity team with low positivity is a team focused on tasks and results with little attention to the impact on people and relationships. It will produce results in the short term, but burn-out is almost inevitable. A high positivity team with low productivity will have good will and caring, and the business might go completely down the tubes in that kind of spa resort atmosphere. You get the picture; maybe you&rsquo;ve been there. Both productivity and positivity strengths are essential.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">The Stellar Team Diagnostic is an 80-question, confidential, on-line instrument that takes participants about 15-20 minutes to complete. All of the questions are presented from the team point of view. For example, &ldquo;There is a high level of accountability and follow through on our team.&rdquo; We also customize each assessment with at least three open-ended essay-style questions to give each team member a personal voice in the process. The results are compiled in a report that describes the model&mdash;so team members understand the context for their results&mdash;and includes graphics that literally paint a portrait of the system. Because the team assesses itself, there is strong buy-in. This is not an outside consultant evaluating the team; it is the team rating itself. </p>
<p><strong>How it is used</strong></p>
<p>We use the assessment with teams of all varieties and at all stages: intact, project, cross-functional, virtual teams or non-profit boards, newly formed teams, long-standing teams, teams in transition. The strength of the assessment is its ability to reveal the system to itself in a way that is equal parts discovery and benchmarking. So no matter what form the team is in today, the assessment creates the basis for coaching conversation. &ldquo;This is who you are and where you are as a team; where do you want to go?&rdquo; The scores provide a clear sense of direction for this conversation. The picture is in front of everyone on the team and they drew that picture by their responses. They now have a consensus view and the coach is in an ideal position to work out next steps. A two-day off-site is our preferred approach to go over the results with the team and begin the on-going coaching. The process can be done in less time but we prefer a longer session initially because there can be a seduction to analysis of scores and graphs (the &ldquo;consensus reality&rdquo; in ORSC terms). The coaching of the picture revealed, not the numbers themselves, is, after all, where you will have the most impact with the team.</p>
<p><strong>How you can use this tool</strong></p>
<p>Team Diagnostic International (TDI) is the vendor for the Stellar Team Diagnostic instrument. You, as coach, arrange to work with a team; you provide TDI with basic information, such as team name, team member names and email addresses, your selection of open-ended questions. The assessment goes out under your name. When all of the team members have completed the assessment, a report is sent to you. You present the results to your team. To utilize the assessment, you need to be an experienced coach, consultant, OD or HR professional, or have extensive corporate experience working with teams. Graduates of the ORSC curriculum are ideal candidates. </p>
<p>This is a tool designed for coaches who understand the value and want to work with the team as a system. The model is built on the ground-breaking work of Marita Fridjhon and Faith Fuller and their approach to relationship systems. This approach to long-term team effectiveness also utilizes Emotional Intelligence, Appreciative Inquiry, Positive Psychology and team research from leading universities. The end result is an assessment that is a practical tool for coaches and others working with teams and a tool that meets the organization where it wants to be met. In our experience, organizations love metrics. We believe this is a tool that will help coaches get in the door to work with teams. We also know that people on teams want relationships that work and a work atmosphere that is positive, productive and life-giving. We believe this tool provides the navigational aids to guide teams to that inspired place. </p>
