<h1 style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Networking Is Magic...Except When It Isn&rsquo;t</strong></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;">Ask any successful coach how to go about building a thriving coaching practice, and you are likely to hear that networking is one of the most powerful strategies you can use. But newer coaches often say they put a lot of effort into networking without seeing much return. Why are these two answers so noticeably different?</p>
<p>First, let's define the kind of networking that builds a practice. It's not just about circulating through a room exchanging business cards. A broader view of networking is creating a pool of contacts from which you can draw clients, referrals, resources, ideas and information. Your business network can and should contain not only prospective clients, but colleagues, competitors, a wide range of business people and personal friends.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on how many people you can meet quickly, your attention should be on who it is you are meeting. Rather than trying to move people quickly along the path from contact to prospect to sale, your focus should be on building relationships. The stronger your relationships are, the more clients eventually result. But it does take time&mdash;and repeated contacts&mdash;for relationships to grow.</p>
<p>Recently, a woman became my client who I had known for a couple of years. We first met at a networking meeting for self-employed professional women. We seemed to have a few things in common, so we agreed to meet for lunch. We exchanged some ideas and resources, and got to know each other better. She wasn&rsquo;t interested in becoming my client at that time, but now that she knew more about my business, she thought she might refer people to me occasionally.</p>
<p>I added her to my mailing list, and she added me to hers. We ran into each other again a couple of times at other networking meetings. She never did refer me a client, but I ended up referring a client to her awhile later. Months passed. Then one day, she emailed me, and said she had an issue perhaps I could help with. We had a phone conversation, and about a week later, she became my client.</p>
<p>If you look through one lens, it might seem that this was a random sequence of events. I met her by accident; luckily, we had something in common, we happened to stay in touch, then somehow, magically, she became a client. I&rsquo;ve often had new coaches tell me that the only clients they got through networking were purely due to luck.</p>
<p>But to quote the Roman philosopher Seneca, &ldquo;Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.&rdquo; Looking through a different lens, this client came to me not by magic, but due to a series of acts and choices I made. Let&rsquo;s look at them together and see how it is that networking works to create clients:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <p><strong>1. I chose a specific niche of clients to serve.</strong> Because I had decided that my clients would be self-employed professionals, I chose a networking group made up of people who fit this description. That dramatically increased the chances of finding clients and referral sources within this group.</p>
  <p><strong>2. I got out of the house and went to a networking meeting that night.</strong> Networking doesn&rsquo;t have to take place at in-person meetings, but organized events are one of the easiest ways to meet new people in a specific category. By not just joining this group, but attending their meetings, I was pretty sure to meet many prospective clients.</p>
  <p><strong>3. I engaged in meaningful conversation with someone I met.</strong> Instead of just telling my new acquaintance all about my coaching practice, I asked questions to find some common ground between us. Then we had a thoughtful conversation about a topic of interest to us both, which led to the idea of lunch.</p>
  <p><strong>4. I made myself available to deepen the relationship.</strong> Without knowing if she was likely to become a client or not, I agreed to a lunch date. The fact that she was in my target market and we had some common interests was enough for me to think this would be worthwhile. During lunch, I offered freely of my ideas and resources, and she did the same. As a result, we built a bond of trust.</p>
  <p><strong>5. I told her who my ideal clients were.</strong> When we met for lunch, I made sure to tell her about the type of clients I was interested in finding and how I could help them. That way, she could determine if she would be a good client for me herself, as well as refer others. I asked her about her ideal clients also, to see what further connections there might be between us.</p>
  <p><strong>6. I looked for ways to make the relationship reciprocal.</strong> Because I felt as if she was someone I liked and trusted, I didn&rsquo;t wait to see if she would do anything for me. Instead, I found something I could do for her&mdash;I referred her a prospective client.</p>
  <p><strong>7. I found ways to stay in touch.</strong> We had multiple contacts over the months between when we met and when she hired me as her coach&mdash;at the networking group we both attended, through our respective mailings, and when I referred her a client and she thanked me. When she had a problem, she thought of me first, instead of any of the dozen other coaches she knew.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>8. I offered help before she hired me.</strong> When she contacted me with her issue, I first offered assistance, then asked if we might work together on it. I didn&rsquo;t offer her free coaching, but I listened to her problem and gave her some ideas on how to approach it. It helped her see how we might work together and decide if I was the right person to hire.<br>

<p style="margin-top:0;">Building relationships like this one does take time and effort. It requires a lot more than simply waiting for the magic to happen. But reciprocal relationships are the core of true networking. If you read through the eight steps I outlined above, you&rsquo;ll see that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one networking&mdash;my client was doing it too.</p>
<p>This is the true secret of effective networking&mdash;the one that separates the successful coach from the new coach who wonders if it is all worthwhile. Networking is about relationship building. You need to put in the effort now, and trust that you will see results later. The coaches who followed that rule when they were new are now the successful ones who tell newcomers how networking is magic...except when it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
