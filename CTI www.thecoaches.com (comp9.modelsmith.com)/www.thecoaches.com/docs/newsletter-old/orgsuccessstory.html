<h1> A Coaching in Organizations Success Story</h1>
<p> Coaching inside an organization provides benefits, challenges and rewards. 
  If the coaching service is well defined and positioned, the coach is never at 
  a loss for clients. My employer, Fairview Health Services, has provided a welcoming 
  and supportive environment for Co-Active coaching. To launch this internal benefit, 
  my colleague, Mary Stultz and I simply contacted senior leaders within Fairview, 
  told them about the work we were doing and asked to do some sample coaching 
  with them. As you all know, the Co-Active model works! Our senior leaders not 
  only appreciated the coaching they were receiving but started sending us more 
  clients. They also spoke at Fairview forums about the benefits they were receiving 
  from coaching, and we quickly had more clients than we thought we could handle. 
  As a result, we brought the Co-Active curriculum inside and have since added 
  50 coaches to our ranks. The demand for internal coaches keeps growing. <br>
  <br>
  Constant self-management is critical to our ongoing success. We have learned 
  that maintaining confidence is key in sustaining the reputation we have achieved. 
  The coach needs to forget many things that are brought up in a session, and 
  when subsequent announcements are made, the coach needs to act as surprised 
  as everyone else. <br>
  <br>
  We do not advertise or in any way make known who is receiving coaching. Our 
  reporting consists of numbers of clients being coached, without including names. 
  We encourage our coaches to keep minimal notes on clients, typically listing 
  only assignments. <br>
  <br>
  In some sessions, clients raise issues that have a direct impact on the coach&#8217;s 
  job or on a close friend of the coach. Maintaining Level 2 and 3 listening and 
  being over there with the client can be especially challenging at those times. 
  Having your own coach to &#8220;clear&#8221; with has proved to be extremely 
  advantageous. <br>
  <br>
  Because we all understand the business we are in and the politics in our organization, 
  it is easy to slip from role of coach to consultant. Being clear with our clients 
  about the role we are filling is important to the ongoing relationship and the 
  reputation of coaching in the organization.<br>
  <br>
  Since we know our clients&#8217; agendas and see them in action, we have the 
  opportunity to design our alliances to incorporate specific observations and 
  feedback for the client. <br>
  <br>
  Ongoing development and learning is also critical to the spread of coaching 
  within Fairview. Our internal coaches meet quarterly to practice existing skills 
  and learn new ones. We have &#8220;liaison coaches&#8221; who are available 
  to answer questions, provide guidance or coaching to a coach with questions 
  or concerns. We recognize and appreciate that the ability of the individual 
  coach influences the organization&#8217;s perspective on coaching. <br>
  <br>
  We presently have approximately 250 employees in coaching relationships. They 
  range from front line to senior level executives. Our organizational vocabulary 
  now includes words and phrases such as: designed alliance, dancing in the moment, 
  landing the plane, perspectives and being in choice. And of course, we fall 
  in love with our clients. Can you imagine the awesome beauty of being in love 
  with your co-workers, knowing them on a deep level, seeing who they are and 
  who they are becoming and being able to be a part of their amazing journey? 
  That is exactly what internal coaching, the co-active way, is about.</p>
