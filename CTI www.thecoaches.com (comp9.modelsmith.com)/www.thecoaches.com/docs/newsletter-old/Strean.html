<h1><strong>Somatic Coaching:  Rethinking the Body</strong></h1>
<p>I probably couldn&rsquo;t have articulated it when I began my  coach training, but I got into this gig largely because I wanted to help people  feel the rapture of being alive. During my Co-Active Coaching and Leadership  programs, I had an inkling that there was something quite powerful about  working with and through the body that would crank up people&rsquo;s joy, wonder and  connection with each other. When I attended my first ICF conference in  Vancouver, I went to a workshop where David Martin from the Newfield Network  told us that his experience was that one session working with the body was as  valuable as 10 of talking. My hunger to learn about the body grew. I knew there  was more to it than &ldquo;Where do you feel that in your body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you are reading these words, notice that you are having  some thoughts&mdash;you are engaged in some story or narrative. You may be thinking  about how damn cool it is to have these great little articles available via the  Internet. Perhaps you are wondering about what a greater somatic sensibility  could bring to you and your clients. Also check out that you are currently  experiencing some mood or emotion. Maybe you are excited because you love to  learn; you might be calm or happy and you may not be sure why. You are also  having some sensations: tingling, pulsing, tension, relaxation, hot, cold. All  of these thoughts, moods and sensations are embodied. It is this perspective of <em>soma</em>&mdash;the body in its wholeness&mdash;that creates new possibilities and new  directions for coaching. </p>
<p>We all grew up in some form of a world that has mind-body  dualism embedded in our language. We speak about &ldquo;your body&rdquo; as if it is  distinct from your self. When we reconstruct the body not as an object, but as  a domain of action and a domain of learning that has a history, the concept of  &ldquo;body&rdquo; and the concept of &ldquo;self&rdquo; become virtually one and the same. </p>
<p>As I searched to learn more about coaching the body, many  paths and conversations led me to Richard Strozzi-Heckler and the Strozzi  Institute. My approach to coaching has deepened and expanded through somatic  coaching. The &ldquo;self that I am&rdquo; has shifted greatly though doing somatic work  and becoming a Certified Somatic Coach. I credit most of the ideas here to  Richard and can tell you he is the most impressive human I&rsquo;ve met.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of why I think a somatic approach to coaching is  immensely valuable and transformational: We live in a culture where most people  are disembodied. The body has become an object that carries us from our  computer to the next meeting. When coaching brings people to greater awareness  of feeling and sensation, their aliveness begins to grow. The fact that so many  clients live in their heads makes it relatively easy to make a big impact with  some simple somatic practices. It&rsquo;s amazing to see how a basic centering  practice can have clients &ldquo;feel into themselves&rdquo; like they haven&rsquo;t in years.</p>
<p>It seems to me that our Co-Active Coaching training taught  us the importance of &ldquo;being.&rdquo; We recognize that the &ldquo;being of coach&rdquo; is essential  to the work that has clients shift.&nbsp;  Decent coaching is transactional&mdash;the client can do some things  differently as a result. Great coaching is transformational&mdash;the &ldquo;self that the  client is&rdquo; shifts. Although these breakthroughs can happen through conversations,  somatic approaches are like a super highway to altering how people show up in  the world. </p>
<p>A somatic sensibility enhances each step of the coaching  journey. During intakes, in addition to exploring values, goals and beliefs, we  begin to observe clients: What is the story the body tells? How are they  carrying themselves? What strengths do they embody? What areas of learning and  development do our assessments suggest? As we work with clients, we may move  with them and learn about how they &ldquo;extend, receive and blend&rdquo;&mdash;or not. We may  notice where they are &ldquo;armored.&rdquo; When working with a couple or in an  organization, we might have two people move together, such as in a &ldquo;two-step.&rdquo;  We will learn more in a few minutes about how they coordinate and where the  relationship breaks down than we would in an hour of talking about it.</p>
<p>When we are clear about what clients are committed to and  the shifts in being that will support them, we can then see the enormous value  of somatic practices. Perhaps the greatest lesson I have learned as a client, a  coach (and in other work with individuals and groups), is the importance of  practices. Insights are like flatulence&mdash;they tend to evaporate. In the same way  that structures keep ideas in place, practices are crucial to clients shifting  who they are. For example, if I want to be playful in my life, I may develop a  practice of putting on some upbeat music that inspires me to shake my booty  before I start my work. Or if I want to be grounded and focused, I may take on a  sitting or meditation practice. I have found that somatic practices expand the  learning and growth that clients experience between coaching sessions.</p>
<p>Anatole France once said, &ldquo;Do not try to satisfy your vanity  by teaching a great many things. Awaken people's curiosity. It is enough to  open minds: do not overload them. Put there just a spark. If there is some good  flammable stuff, it will catch fire.&rdquo; If there is a spark, I recommend <em>Anatomy of Change,</em> by Richard  Strozzi-Heckler. </p>
