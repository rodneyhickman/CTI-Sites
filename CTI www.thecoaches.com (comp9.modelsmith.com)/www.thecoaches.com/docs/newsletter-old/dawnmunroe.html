<h1>CTI Staff Profile--Dawn Munroe </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dawn Munroe is the events coordinator for The Coaches Training Institute. She handles the entire leader scheduling for our public and corporate offerings and all of the logistical details involved in that process. She figures since the start of her career here at CTI, she&rsquo;s scheduled over 3,000 courses with more than 60 hotels and made arrangements for about 70 leaders over time. Whew! It&rsquo;s pretty clear that we&rsquo;d be lost without Dawn in the office&mdash;especially because she is also the one who organizes our staff events, such as the company picnic, safety and ergonomics presentations, various and sundry Theme Days in the office and all holiday dinners. Those on staff here at CTI would agree that we have good associations with Dawn&rsquo;s name and presence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I asked Dawn how she got here, she said, &ldquo;A little over two years ago, my best friend Heather, who worked in Certification, notified me of an opening at CTI as an event coordinator. At the time, I was working part-time at three different jobs, one of which was in a booking agency. I was a week away from graduating from college and thought that the offer was right up my alley. I gave my other jobs notice and applied for the position. It was the only resume I submitted to any company. After several phone and in-person interviews I was hired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best part of the job, in Dawn&rsquo;s opinion, is the detail and complexity. She is constantly challenged to hold and juggle a plethora of particles. She uses her creative abilities to design new systems and procedures to manage and execute her work. Dawn says that as an eight soul type she lives in the world of structure, organization and synthesis. And I say that being a Capricorn doesn&rsquo;t hurt either! She&rsquo;s such a Capricorn in fact, that when I asked her place and date of birth, she said, &ldquo;San Francisco, California, 8:23 a.m. on December 31&mdash;just in time for my parents to get the deductions on their taxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dawn notices that being an ENTJ (Myers-Briggs type) also complements her job skills. &ldquo;Being an extrovert is vital for this position because I am not only required to work with my peers in the office environment but with the leader body, hotels and occasionally participants with logistical inquiries. This is not a job for the timid or ambivalent. This job also requires me to be innovative and confident in my insight, kind of a shoot-from-the-hip mentality. And while one must have a feeling nature when such tasks are in need of attention, this position is built and depends on fact- and detail-oriented judgment that can be rationalized and not just defined by an emotional response.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Does all that thinking make Dawn a dull girl? Hardly! She likes to celebrate the completion of a demanding project by &ldquo;doing a little dance like football players perform after a touchdown.&rdquo; When asked what Co-Activity looks like in her life, Dawn says &ldquo;It is a gigantic and progressive dinner party where everyone is host, cook, guest, maid and entertainer.&rdquo; Sounds like fun. Can we come over?<br>
