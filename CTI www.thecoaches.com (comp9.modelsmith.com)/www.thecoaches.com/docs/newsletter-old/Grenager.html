<h1><strong>The Body is the Way In&mdash;to the Soul, and  to a Life Worth Living</strong></h1>
<p>If body is the temple of the  spirit (and what else explains it really?), feelings, which come through the  body, are surely the voice of the soul. Life coaching, to make a significant  difference, must teach people to listen to that voice, <em>their</em> voice, and trust it enough to live in accordance with what  they hear. My experience suggests we humans can best heed our unique voices by  paying close attention to the body, home of the heart and its treasure-trove of  emotions and sensations. Understanding that is the basis of somatic coaching.</p>
<p>The mind is, by nature,  corruptible. It tends to believe and internalize what it hears, especially the  negative. It cannot help but tell us lies about ourselves and what&rsquo;s happening  around us. Conditioned as it&rsquo;s been by our often unenlightened elders and  dysfunctional culture, mind alone is not a reliable tool for developing  self-awareness, trust or a worthy life. To be effective life coaches, we&rsquo;d do  well to encourage clients to spend more time at home in their bodies. </p>
<p>By having clients tune in and  attend to sensations in their hearts, throats and guts, we can help them find  and express their voices. Unlike mind, body doesn&rsquo;t lie. It tells it like it  is, if we&rsquo;ll but listen: <em>I like this, I  really don&rsquo;t like that.</em> (Sometimes of course, we don&rsquo;t like something for  reasons that don&rsquo;t serve us, but that&rsquo;s another story.) Because the body is  such a generally reliable barometer of our state of being, somatic awareness is  fundamental to creating a life that&rsquo;s right for us and, so it seems to me, to  great life coaching.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to coach somatically,  we must first learn to listen for and pay attention to the signals of our own  bodies. What am I feeling&mdash;physically, emotionally, and spiritually&mdash;as I think,  do and say this or that? What is my body trying to tell me? What life choices  am I willing to make on that basis? Once we&rsquo;re in the habit of practicing  somatic awareness, we will naturally invite our clients to pay similar  attention to what somatic practitioners call our &ldquo;body wisdom.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This<em> seems</em> simple enough. But attending to body wisdom is not so easy.  I&rsquo;ve been at it for 30 years, first as a Kripalu Yoga student and teacher,  later as a body-mind therapist. Since 1999 as a life coach, I&rsquo;ve been using  what I learned&mdash;and am still learning&mdash;about body wisdom, to encourage clients to  look to <em>their</em> bodies for guidance in  creating authentic lives. But there is a second compelling reason to coax  clients out of their heads and into their physical beings. </p>
<p>We CTI coaches know that,  important as it is, creating a life they can enjoy is only part of our clients&rsquo;  happiness equation. They must also be able to enjoy the life they create&mdash;they  need to be <em>fulfilled </em>in the <em>process</em>. And to be fulfilled, our  clients must be able to take life in, here and now, and be nourished by it  (that&rsquo;s Process!). Their capacity to do that rests again in the domain of the  body. We can think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fulfilled&rdquo; till we&rsquo;re blue in the face. But since life  comes to us through the body and its five senses, until we let ourselves <em>feel</em> it, the joy of life will elude us.</p>
<p>How do I integrate these  powerful somatic principles into life coaching? I suggest clients do what I do:  make time often during the day to stop what they are doing, sit or lie down,  and close their eyes. Put one hand over the belly, the other over the heart,  and take long, deep &ldquo;yoga breaths&rdquo; (which I sometimes teach clients over the  phone, and which a well-trained yoga teacher, or even a good book, can teach  you). I urge people to stay supine, breathing, for a while, till the powerful  steadiness of the breath can work its magic on their monkey mind.</p>
<p>Deep, steady breathing is, in  fact, the closest thing I know to a magic bullet for teasing mind back from its  endless and usually useless past and future machinations, to the real world of  body and its feelings. Such breathing can calm us completely down, so our  awareness can drop from the head to the heart and gut. There&mdash;here!&mdash;in touch  with our source, we are able to sense who we truly are and what we want, <em>and</em> we can better appreciate what we  already have.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Before calls, we coaches can  take a few moments to deepen our breath and tune into our bodies. We can stay  self-connected while on the phone, which also helps us know how our clients are  doing. Watching the quality of our own breath, we are reminded to take note of  theirs. Alert to our own tensions, we can&rsquo;t help but pick up on theirs. We want  to listen too, of course, for the words, tones, sounds and silences that  suggest we may both have gotten lost in our heads. We can decide to stop  talking and check in together at the level of gut and heart. </p>
<p>This can be as simple as the  centering exercise described above&mdash;leading us both to close our eyes, become  quiet, breathe and feel. What does the client <em>know</em> now that they didn&rsquo;t know they knew when we were busy talking?  What do I know now about how better to support them? In the silence, the gaps  between words and thoughts, which such a &ldquo;mini-meditation&rdquo; provides, fresh  insights are likely to come to us both. Body wisdom has room to play.</p>
<p>We all like to coach our  clients to lofty life goals. But I&rsquo;ve noticed my most satisfied customers are  the ones I&rsquo;ve helped get to know and embrace themselves from deep inside out&mdash;in  mind, body and spirit. In touch with their joyful, radiant core, these people  are not only doing what they love, they also love what they do. That is the  sweet fruit of &ldquo;somatic coaching.&rdquo; </p>
