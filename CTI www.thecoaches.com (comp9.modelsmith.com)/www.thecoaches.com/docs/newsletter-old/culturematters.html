<p align="left" class="style1" style="margin-top:0;">Culture Matters</p>
<p class="style2">Why is it important to pay attention to culture in coaching? The following story gives you the context. </p>
<p class="style2">As often happens, the call for coaching assistance came when an organizational leader, Alice, was at her wits end. Alice was the director of a public housing and community development agency with a staff of 28. A Japanese American, she had 23 years experience in a different jurisdiction. Her staff was made up largely of two groups. An older &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; crowd was mostly White, many within three or four years of retirement. The other cluster was young &ldquo;activists,&rdquo; many of them people of color recruited from social change organizations. They worked in a poor community with high unemployment and with many undocumented residents. The community had changed dramatically since the older staff had begun working there. Some of the staff &ldquo;problematized&rdquo; the community, but Alice came in with a very different perspective. She had grown up in a neighborhood much like this and had first-hand experience creating a wonderful sense of &ldquo;home&rdquo; in communities that bureaucrats had written off. Her agenda was to create an environment where families could thrive.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style2">After three days on the job, the &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; gave her a list of their demands. They didn&rsquo;t want to have to do extra work, be responsive to the concerns of the community, nor engage the community in decision-making. Alice began to identify people on her staff who grew up in the neighborhoods where they now worked. She decided to work with them and to let the old timers wait for their retirement. It didn&rsquo;t work. They felt threatened and called for her resignation. </p>
<p class="style2">A few weeks after starting coaching, Alice got a pink slip from the County. She felt blind-sided. The coach invited Alice to consider the cultural assumptions about what kind of leader she should be. Her staff was looking for a charismatic, take-charge &ldquo;big&rdquo; leader. As a Japanese-American woman, this was not the leader-self that Alice had cultivated. In one coaching session, Alice wrote down all the leadership qualities she considered important and which she embodied. Her list consisted of words like honoring, consensus-building, humble, competent, empathetic. As a coaching assignment, Alice wrote a letter outlining these leadership skills. After sharing this with her bosses, they rescinded the pink slip. Alice is now in her third year, and she&rsquo;s seeing the results of staking her claim to her culturally based leadership style and NOT trying to make herself into something expected by the dominant culture. Her leadership style is transforming the culture of the department. </p>
<p class="style2">How was coaching helpful in this situation? It helped Alice identify the cultural elements contributing to the dynamic. She worked to articulate them so that they became visible to her supervisors and her staff. It gave her permission to explore her strengths and to engage in a dialogue with those who might not initially recognize them as strengths. She had an increased sense of herself as an effective leader. </p>
<p class="style2">To be an effective coach, culture needs to be on the radar screen, and we need to understand that culture is multi-layered (racial, ethnic culture, living culture in organization or system, or community historical culture). A culturally competent coach understands how each layer impacts the capacity of the organization to heal and change.</p>
<p class="style2">What can coaches do to become culturally competent? </p>
<p class="style2">An important first step is to develop a practice of paying attention to culture as one of the core competencies of coaching. Currently, White is the primary/dominant cultural lens within the coaching world. The challenge is that the dominant culture isn&rsquo;t perceived as a culture at all; it&rsquo;s just understood as &ldquo;the way we do things.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style2">Start by exploring your own cultural awareness. Try this exercise now. And don&rsquo;t peek ahead! Answer these three questions: </p>
<ol class="style2">
  <li>What cultures do I belong to?</li>
  <li>What are the attributes of that culture?</li>
  <li>How does that culture impact my way of being in the world? </li>
</ol>
<p class="style2" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;">For example, if your cultural lens is White, it&rsquo;s highly likely that you use linear thinking. What is the impact of that when you are coaching someone whose life paradigm is a circle? It&rsquo;s easy to fall into judgments about one or the other, if they are not seen as equally informative elements of our experience. If you are coaching someone else whose paradigm is linear, it&rsquo;s equally important to honor that. </p>
<p class="style2">When groups are asked these three questions, women overwhelmingly say they are part of the culture of women. Men don&rsquo;t consider they are part of the culture of men. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender (GLBT) people usually identify GLBT as a culture, while heterosexuals rarely identify their own culture. When our culture is dominant, we think we don&rsquo;t have a culture because we are swimming in it. </p>
<p class="style2">What are you swimming in? A coach who is culturally aware can recognize the water s/he is swimming in and that of their client, and hold that as one element of what influences their interactions.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style2">How do we train coaches to be culturally aware? </p>
<p class="style2">Diversity needs to be a thread that runs through the whole of a curriculum, rather than a &ldquo;module.&rdquo; At CTI, there is a cornerstone that holds all humans as naturally creative, resourceful and whole. This is a powerful lens that honors the differences and contributions of all humans. When CTI first took coaching training into prisons, the training did not consciously include culture. Once inside, the trainers discovered that the dynamics of the prison system include purposeful division of cultures (better to have groups against each other than against the system). In CTI coaching courses within the prison, there were Native Americans, African-Americans, Whites, and Asians and none of these groups had ever had a conversation with anyone from the other groups. Over time, these divisions broke down, in and out of the classroom. This was done on the shoulders of &ldquo;naturally creative, resourceful and whole.&rdquo; It was powerful. One wonders how much more powerful it might have been if there had been an understanding of the layers of culture, including the culture of the trainers. What if there had been understanding of the learning styles of different cultures? What if there were these threads of diversity in the training curricula so that the prisoners could understand culture in their coaching work inside the prison?</p>
<p class="style2">We invite you to explore your own cultures, and the waters where you swim all the time. What is the impact of your culture on your own coaching? How aware are you of the cultures of your clients? What is the overall awareness shift of the coaching profession that will create richer and more diverse students and clients?</p>
