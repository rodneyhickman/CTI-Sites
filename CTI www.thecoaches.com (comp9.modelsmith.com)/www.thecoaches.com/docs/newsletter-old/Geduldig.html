<h1>A  Body in Motion Stays in Motion</h1>
<h2>How an Active Lifestyle Generates Zest for Life </h2>
<p>Is there a connection between moving your body and having a  fulfilling life? This life coach says YES!</p>
<p>Remember being a kid and running around with your friends  until your parents made you come in? That sensation in your body&hellip;how alive you  felt&hellip;as if nothing could stop you? As adults, most of us are completely out of  touch with that high level of life force. But where did it go&hellip;and how do we get  it back? Have you noticed how life in 2006 is filled with so much sitting?  Sitting in traffic, sitting at the computer, sitting in front of the TV, and  even sitting while engaged in the process of coaching. What would it take for  you to STAND UP and start living in motion again? What impact would this have  on your clients? What if you got them engaged in this process for themselves?</p>
<p>I was recently hired by <em>Fitness  Magazine</em> for their &ldquo;You Can Do It Challenge!&rdquo; to be on a team of experts  that included personal trainers, nutritionists and life coaches (see <a href="http://www.fitnessmagpromo.com/experts/index.html" target="_blank">www.fitnessmagpromo.com/experts/index.html</a> for more information). We worked with corporate clients over the course of  eight weeks to support them in creating change in their lives through the  framework of a healthier lifestyle. Each week, we met with the clients for  10-minute sessions, holding them accountable to small action steps, like taking  a walk outside for lunch, drinking more water and less coffee, biking to work  or eating fruit as a 4:00 snack. I was blown away by the effectiveness that  these mini-sessions were able to have. I believe that the key to the success of  this program was that all of the participants were committed to engaging in a  new level of physical activity and awareness of their bodies. By the end of the  program, they felt rejuvenated, invigorated and empowered to take on the  challenges of their high-powered lives. </p>
<p>Before becoming a life coach, I was the Associate Director  for the California AIDS Ride. This was a 700-mile fundraising bike ride from  San Francisco to Los Angeles in which non-cyclists committed to training for  nearly a year to be able to complete this monumental physical event. I  supported thousands of people in taking on one of the biggest challenges of  their lives. And I had the honor of witnessing the power of the human potential  through the stories of each rider crossing the finish line. Sure people lost  weight and got into great shape, but that was just the surface of what transformed.  I remember being at the closing ceremonies, giving hugs to rider after rider.  You would think these people would be beat and ready to crash, but the  sentiment that I heard more than anything else was, &ldquo;Wow, if I can do that I  can do anything&hellip;what&rsquo;s next for me?&rdquo;<br />
  And you know, I felt the same way when I completed my AIDS  Ride and other physical challenges that I&rsquo;ve participated in. How about you?</p>
<p>In my private practice as a life coach, I am dedicated to  working with all of my clients on creating an active lifestyle and finding  movement that they LOVE. Each week, my clients commit to some form of physical  activity as a supportive framework to the other areas of their lives that they  are working on. At the beginning of each session, we do a quick wellness  check-in, where they get to report back on how they are feeling in their body  and the impact that their movement practice is having on their lives. I&rsquo;ve  found this to be a wildly successful tool in moving clients forward towards  their larger life goals.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another inroad into the connection between coaching and the  body is a coaching technique that I have developed called Optimystical Movementsm  or Change-in-Motion (haven&rsquo;t fully landed on a name yet). This is an in-person  class in which the participants literally have a coaching session through  movement. I play music and coach people through a series of powerful questions  and they non-verbally move the answers. It&rsquo;s amazing what can be discovered  without words. My students have found that so many of their deepest answers  don&rsquo;t come from their heads but from their hearts, and that physical movement  is one of the best ways to access this part of themselves. I had the  opportunity to present this material at the 2005 ICF conference. The overall  feedback was that we need more movement in coaching if we are going to bring  our clients to their truest selves. </p>
<p>As CTI coaches, how do we tap into the power that the body  has to offer? The following are some ideas that I&rsquo;ve had great success with. My  recommendation is that you try these on for yourself in addition to seeing if  they could be helpful for your clients. Have fun!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tip One:</strong> <b>Find a  movement that you LOVE</b>&mdash;dancing to fabulous music, hiking in the redwood trees,  swimming in a local lake, training for your first marathon or simply walking  around your block. Keep trying new ideas until something really clicks. </p>
  <p><strong>Tip Two</strong>: <b>Do  something physical every day for a whole week</b> and see how this transforms your  perspective on your life. </p>
  <p><strong>Tip Three:</strong> <b>Don&rsquo;t  fall into the trap</b> of having this just be about losing weight or getting into  shape. These things can be wonderful outcomes but make sure to check out what  is underneath them. </p>
  <p><strong>Tip Four:</strong> <b>Encourage yourself </b>to work towards creating a positive body image, and let go  of negative gremlin voices that are holding you back from feeling great about  your body. </p>
  <p><strong>Tip Five:</strong> <b>Ask  your coach to play</b> with geography and getting you out of the chair. </p>
  <p><strong>Tip Six:</strong> <b>Play  music </b>in between coaching calls and dance around the room. Notice how this  impacts you as coach. </p>
