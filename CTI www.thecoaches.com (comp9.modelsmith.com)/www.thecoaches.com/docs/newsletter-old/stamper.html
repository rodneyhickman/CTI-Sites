<h1 class="style1">  Good Coaching Is Good Marketing?  </h1>
<p class="style6">Every semester, I tell my marketing students that I see two main reasons why businesses fail, especially new entrepreneurs. Ears perk up by those taking the class because some are also wanting to start their own business. So pay attention here coaches, because if you charge for your services, you are also in business. </p>
<p class="style6">And those two reasons that businesses fail? They are: 1) the lack of a sound business plan, and 2) no marketing plan. </p>
<p class="style6">Many coaches ask,&ldquo; Does marketing pay off?&rdquo; Kraft Foods attributes a 6.4% increase in net revenues due to the impact of higher marketing spending. Monster Worldwide, the parent company of the leading global online career property, grew its 2004 fourth quarter revenue an incredible 45% and expects 2005 revenue to increase significantly because of their strategic investments in marketing.</p>
<p class="style6">These are large corporations, you say, how can that be compared to a small coaching operation run by the sole proprietor? Ruth Iyorbo, a Rochester, MN, woman, combined her knowledge of herbal remedies with some scientific and manufacturing experience to come up with Nature&rsquo;s Silk. The company now has 13 products, all created by Iyorbo out of her Rochester kitchen. Her marketing plan backs up her business plan, which has a first-year goal of breaking even.</p>
<p class="style6">Coaches, just like Kraft and Ruth Iyorbos, want to be successful. We want our clients to experience the reality of knowing they are creative, resourceful and whole. On page one of <em>Co-Active Coaching</em>, by Laura Whitworth, Henry Kimsey-House and Phil Sandahl, it says that &ldquo;&hellip;coaching focuses on what clients want.&rdquo; However, the best coach in the world keeps their value to themselves unless they are able to market their service to their audience (in marketing terms, <em>target market</em>). There are exceptions, yes, but that is the general rule.</p>
<p class="style6">OK, Mark, you&rsquo;ve energized me into wanting to incorporate more effective marketing, but how exactly how do I do it? Where do I start?</p>
<p class="style6">You start with the coachee, who is also the customer. Focusing on what clients want is also good marketing. Meeting the needs and wants of customers/clients/coachees is both good coaching and good marketing. All business people, not just coaches, sometimes have trouble linking meeting needs with marketing.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6">What I notice with coaches is, when the reality sets in that knowledge of business principles are an essential part of having a financially successful coaching practice, that reality often gets pushed down in priority, and confusion can set in.</p>
<p class="style6">I belabor that starting point so that it stays a priority from a marketing perspective. But that&rsquo;s only the starting point. To build a successful business, there must also be emphasis on product/service, price, promotion and distribution. That&rsquo;s the standard marketing mix.</p>
<p class="style6">I find that each business person refines that mix to make it work best for them. It&rsquo;s kind of like taking a standard box recipe and tweaking it so that it&rsquo;s your own special blend, and you finally get it to come out so that it&rsquo;s so good that others want to copy your recipe.</p>
<p class="style6">So here&rsquo;s my recipe for successful marketing:</p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="style6" style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>A strategic plan that looks at your company&rsquo;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.</li>
  <li>A set of written business ethics.</li>
  <li>Some marketing research, especially on your target market.</li>
  <li>A dose of understanding consumer buying behavior.</li>
  <li>Target marketing and positioning of your service/niche.</li>
  <li>The right price (profit).</li>
  <li>The right promotion (communication messages that reach your target audience).</li>
  <li>Customer service&mdash;the business accelerator.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style6" style="margin-top:0;">You won&rsquo;t find yours unless you experiment a little in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="style6">Where will marketing take business in the future? Let&rsquo;s look at consumer broadband adoption, still new, like coaching. Forrester Research, an independent technology research agency, says that marketers will spend $26 billion in marketing activities by 2010 to influence that broadband adoption. Will something similar be written about coaching as the branding catches fire? We all should hope so.</p>
<p class="style6">One final thought. I know we all know this, but gremlins will do the same thing to coaches that they do to our clients. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a business person, so what makes you think you can make this successful?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you know about marketing?&rdquo; Etc., etc. Gremlins, you can read this, but your opinion is not going to be allowed today, unless it helps move things forward. </p>
<p class="style6">Coaches, don&rsquo;t let your fear of marketing keep you from taking no action. Think of it this way: a sound marketing plan should be as important to your business plan as the intake session is to designing your alliance with a new coaching client.</p>
<p class="style6">Coaches, go forth helping your clients to create their wonderful world, working with the tremendous resources they already possess to find out what it&rsquo;s like to dance in a space of wholeness. Go meet the needs and wants of your customers.</p>
