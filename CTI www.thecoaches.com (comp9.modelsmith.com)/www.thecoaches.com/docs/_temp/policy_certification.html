<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman';"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><strong>General Information Regarding Pricing, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds</strong>: If you choose to cancel your enrollment in a course, and if it is 21 or more days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of the course, you will receive a full refund, excluding the $50 non-refundable registration fee. Written notifications to cancel a course received must be postmarked 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the course start date. If you cancel less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of a course, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 non-refundable registration fee.&nbsp; <strong>Discounted Package Withdrawal:</strong> If you withdraw from a discounted program package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The $50 non-refundable registration fee will be applied if written notice is received less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the next course date. The full individual course fee is $725 for Fundamentals and $1200 each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.&nbsp; <strong>Individual Course Withdrawal:</strong> If you withdraw from an individual course after the course has already begun, you will receive a prorated refund, minus the $50 non-refundable registration fee, based on time completed in the course. For example, if you attend the Fundamentals Course and cancel 12 hours into the course: $725 (Fundamentals Tuition) - $50 (non-refundable Registration Fee) = $675 (Course Fee less Registration Fee) $675 divided by 18.75 (Total Fundamentals classroom hours) = $36.00 (Amount per classroom hour) x 6.75 (Classroom hours not attended) = $243.00 Student Refund Amount.&nbsp; <strong>Transfer Fees:&nbsp; </strong>You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed), are assessed a <strong>USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</strong>. Certification program transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.</span></p>
