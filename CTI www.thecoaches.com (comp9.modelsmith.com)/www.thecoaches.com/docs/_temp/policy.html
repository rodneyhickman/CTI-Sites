<h4>REFUND POLICIES (For All Course Participants except Minnesota Residents):</h4>
<p><strong>General Information Regarding Pricing, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds</strong>: If you choose to cancel your enrollment in a course, and if it is 21 or more days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of the course, you will receive a full refund, excluding the $50 non-refundable registration fee. Written notifications to cancel a course received must be postmarked 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the course start date. If you cancel less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the start of a course, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 non-refundable registration fee.&nbsp; <strong>Discounted Package Withdrawal:</strong> If you withdraw from a discounted program package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The $50 non-refundable registration fee will be applied if written notice is received less than 21 days (60 days for Certification) prior to the next course date. The full individual course fee is $725 for Fundamentals, and $1350 each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.&nbsp; <strong>Individual Course Withdrawal:</strong> If you withdraw from an individual course after the course has already begun, you will receive a prorated refund, minus the $50 non-refundable registration fee, based on time completed in the course. For example, if you attend the Fundamentals Course and cancel 12 hours into the course: $725 (Fundamentals Tuition) - $50 (non-refundable Registration Fee) = $675 (Course Fee less Registration Fee) $675 divided by 18.75 (Total Fundamentals classroom hours) = $36.00 (Amount per classroom hour) x 6.75 (Classroom hours not attended) = $243.00 Student Refund Amount.&nbsp; <strong>(For all Certification Program participants, except Minnesota Residents) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><em></em></p>
<p><strong>General Information Regarding Cancellations, Withdrawal<a name="_GoBack"></a>s, and Refunds</strong>: If you choose to cancel your enrollment before the beginning of the program, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 non-refundable registration fee. If you cancel after the start of your program, a refund will be pro-rated for the unused portion of the program. If you withdraw from the program, after the 5th business day of the start of the course, you will receive a pro-rated refund, minus the $50 non-refundable registration fee, based on the time completed in the course. The refund is calculated from the postmarked date of the written notice. For example, if a student&rsquo;s cancellation is received after completing 50 program hours and paid $5,375, the refund would be calculated as follows: $5,375 (Program Tuition) - $50 (non-refundable Registration Fee) = $5,325 (Program Fee less Registration Fee).&nbsp; $5,325 divided by 92 (Total Program hours) = $57.88 (Amount per Program hour) x 42 (Program hours not attended) = $2,430.98 (Student Refund Amount).<strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>Transfer Fees:</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed), are assessed a <strong>USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</strong>. Certification program transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.</p>

If a student gives written notice of cancellation after the first lesson is completed,&nbsp; but before completion of 75 percent of the period of instruction, then the student is assessed a pro rata portion of tuition, fees and all other charges based on the number of days in the term plus 25 percent of the total program cost (25 percent not to exceed $75.00) Any notice of cancellation shall be acknowledged in writing within 10 business days of receipt of such notice and all refunds shall be forwarded to the student within 30 business days of receipt of such notice. This refund policy is not linked to any student conduct policy and any promissory instrument shall not be negotiated prior to the completion of 50 percent of the course. <strong>Notice of Cancellation/ Withdrawal and Refunds</strong>: Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the letter of cancellation is postmarked or, in the case where the notice is hand carried, it shall occur on the date the notice is delivered to the school.&nbsp; The date of execution of the enrollment agreement shall be presumed to be the date of delivery of the notice of acceptance; and if delivered by mail, the postmark date of the letter of acceptance. <strong>Discounted Package Withdrawal Pricing: </strong>If you withdraw from a discounted program package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The full individual course fee is $725 for Fundamentals; $1350 each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy; and $5375 for Certification. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates. <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Individual Course Withdrawals</strong><strong> </strong>Programs not exceeding forty (40) hours in length shall be subject to the regular refund policies herein, except that once such a program has commenced the refund shall be prorated, based on the hours of the program as stated in the school catalog or advertisements and the number of hours attended by the student.<strong> </strong><strong>Transfer Fees: </strong>You may transfer from one course date to another two times without penalty, provided the request is made more than twenty-one (21) days (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed) before the course start date. Subsequent transfers, or transfers that occur within the 21 day window (60 days for Certification once your application has been received and confirmed), are assessed a <strong>USD non-refundable $175.00 fee</strong>.
