CTI students may use materials presented during their course work, including materials on CTI&rsquo;s Learning Hub, in their work with their coaching clients only.&nbsp; Any use of CTI Intellectual Property beyond one-to-one coaching is not allowed without the specific written approval of CTI.</p>
<h4>PAYMENT AND ENROLLMENT</h4>
<p>You may pay by cheque, Visa, MasterCard, Visa Debit. Your signature on the Registration Request Form authorises CTI to automatically charge your credit card. Balances due will be automatically charged 21 days prior to the course date.&nbsp; All course enrollments are subject to availability. If there is no space in your &ldquo;First Choice&rdquo; Course(s) you will be placed on a Waiting List for your &ldquo;First Choice&rdquo; and, subject to availability, enrolled in your &ldquo;Second Choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will receive written notification of your enrollment status. If neither course is available, we will contact you to discuss other options. Your enrollment in a course is based on the receipt of funds for both the deposit and balance due. Your balance is due 21 days prior to the start of your course. In the process of enrolling you in your requested course(s), CTI will notify you if there are insufficient funds. If we do not hear from you within 48 hours of our notification, your requested space in the course(s) may be released. If enrolled in the Discounted Package and payment has not been received by the start of the course, the discounted package price is forfeited and the full Ã la carte course price of Â£1,400 + VAT per intermediate course is due.</p>
<h4>BUYER&rsquo;S RIGHT TO CANCEL </h4>
<p>You have a right to cancel your enrollment and receive a refund by delivering a written notice to: The Coaches Training Institute, 39-41 North Road, London, N7 9DP, United Kingdom or UKRegistration@coactive.com.&nbsp; You do not have the right to cancel by telephoning the school, or by not attending a course you are registered for.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>RIGHT OF REFUSAL </h6>
<p>CTI reserves the right to refuse a student participation&nbsp;in courses and/or programmes.&nbsp; In addition, upon the recommendation of both CTI Course Leaders, CTI reserves the right to remove from a classroom a student who&nbsp;is negatively impacting other students and/or the learning environment.</p>
<h4>REFUND POLICIES: </h4>
<p><strong><u>General Information Regarding Pricing, Cancellations, Withdrawals, and Refunds</u></strong><u>:</u> If you choose to cancel your enrollment in a course, and if it is 21 or more days prior to the start of the course, you will receive a full refund, minus a Â£30 non-refundable registration fee + VAT. Written notifications to cancel a course received must be postmarked 21 days prior to the course start date. If you cancel less than 21 days prior to the start of a course, you will receive a full refund minus a Â£30 non-refundable registration fee + VAT.&nbsp; <strong><u>Discounted Package Withdrawal:</u></strong> If you withdraw from a discounted programme package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The Â£30 non-refundable registration fee + VAT will be applied if written notice is received less than 21 days prior to the next course date. The full individual course fee is Â£475 + VAT for Fundamentals, and Â£1,400 + VAT each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.&nbsp; <strong><u>Individual Course Withdrawal:</u></strong> If you withdraw from an individual course after the course has already begun, you will receive a pro rated refund minus the Â£30 non-refundable registration fee + VAT based on time completed in the course.&nbsp; For example, if you attend the Fundamentals Course, and cancel 12 hours into the course: Â£475 + VAT (Fundamentals Tuition) minus Â£30 + VAT (non-refundable Registration Fee) = Â£445 + VAT (Course Fee less Registration Fee) Â£445 divided by 18.75 (Total Fundamentals classroom hours) = Â£23.73 + VAT (Amount per classroom hour) x 8 (Classroom hours not attended) = Â£189.87 + VAT Student Refund Amount.<br>

Certification programme transfers are not allowed once you are confirmed into a pod.<br>
  <strong><u>Notice of Cancellation/Withdrawal and Refunds:</u></strong> Written notice of cancellation shall take place on the date the cancellation email is received, or the date the letter of cancellation/withdrawal is postmarked, or if hand-delivered, the date delivered to the school.&nbsp; Refunds will be made within 30 days following the receipt of written requests.<br>
  <strong><u>Discounted Package Withdrawal Pricing:</u></strong><strong> </strong>If you withdraw from a discounted programme package, you will be charged the full individual course fee for any completed courses. The full individual course fee is Â£475 + VAT for Fundamentals; Â£1,400 + VAT each for Fulfillment, Balance, Process and Synergy. You will be refunded or charged based on these rates.<br>
  <strong><u>Individual Course Withdrawals:</u></strong><strong> </strong>Programmes not exceeding forty (40) hours in length shall be subject to the regular refund policies herein, except that once such a programme has commenced the refund shall be prorated, based on the hours of the programme as stated in the school catalog or advertisements and the number of hours attended by the student.<strong> </strong></p>

Why do we use electronic course manuals?
 
In keeping with our Green Business Certification, we evaluated our printed course manuals and have made the following changes:
 
1.  We eliminated mass printing of the manuals and instead offer the manual in electronic pdf format.
2.  We had many requests from students for electronic versions rather than the hard copy forms and tools we provided in the manual. In response, we have created all new electronic versions of these forms and tools for your use with clients.
3.  We are delivering these new materials from course webpages that will provide greater clarity on what to do to sustain your learning before, during and after each course.
We hope that this new approach will both serve the environment and enhance your learning.
 
Thanks again and welcome to CTI!
 
Best regards,
Coaches Training Institute
