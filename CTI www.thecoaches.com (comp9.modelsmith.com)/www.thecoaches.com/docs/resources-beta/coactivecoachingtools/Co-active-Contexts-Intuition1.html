<h1 style="line-height:24px;">Co-Active Contexts: Intuition</h1>

<p>By Beth Follini<br><i>&rsquo;Intuition&rsquo; is the second in a series of articles written by CTI trained coaches which focus on the five contexts of the Co-active coaching model. Each context represents a point of contact with the client.</i></p>

<p>I was chatting to the receptionist at the practice rooms where I do my face-to-face coaching, and as she was talking to me about her life, her philosophy of living and where she was heading, I suddenly had an urge, a feeling in my heart and I interrupted her.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Have you ever thought about becoming a coach?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me a bit wide eyed and said yes, she had been interested in using coaching in her work but didn't know much about it or whether it was right for her.</p>

<p>So I started to talk to her about co-active coaching and the model. She was listening politely and then, I had another feeling coming from my heart. </p>

<p>&rsquo;And the unique thing about the co-active coaching model - the thing that sets it apart from other coaching schools is that using and trusting your intuition is key to the whole thing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Well, my intuition was spot on that day. She was now engaged and excited. She told me about how all of her life she believed in the power of intuition and how she used it in different areas of her life. She was so intrigued that intuition could be part of a formal coaching training programme - that it would be legitimised in such a way.</p>

<p>What my intuition had told me was that here was a person who was longing to use her intuition to serve others - she was longing to find a creative and true expression of something that was very important to her. At the time, I didn't know this fully - but my intuition did. </p>

<p>In Co-active coaching, we use intuition in so many ways. It is that feeling which gives us the knowledge of what is happening in between the lines and in the spaces, of a coaching call. It allows us to blurt out what we feel is going on for clients beneath the surfaces of their stories. </p>

<p>Some people describe intuition as being a &rsquo;gut feeling&rsquo; - literally they get a feeling in their stomach that propels them to make an observation to a client, to blurt or to use a metaphor. I always describe my institution as coming from my heart - the heart for me is the home of the emotional, the &rsquo;irrational&rsquo;, the unknown. For you, intuition may live somewhere different inside you or you may experience it as an energy that flows through you. </p>

<p>Crucially, intuition cannot be over-thought or over analysed. If you are coaching, and think oh, my intuition might be saying this, then it is likely that the moment has passed. Intuition is a feeling or an urge that comes to us and needs to be acted on in the moment. </p>

<p>One of the things I always say to clients is that I will be using my intuition throughout the coaching - and sometimes it will land and resonate with them. And sometimes it won't. I always say to them that I am unattached to what I say when speaking with intuition - they don't need to accept it as the &rsquo;truth&rsquo;. That's because when we use intuition we can't always know exactly what we are intuiting - it's not an exact science. </p>

<p>Allow yourself to play with intuition in your coaching - blurt things before thinking about them too much. Notice what lands and what doesn't. And trust, trust that you have the gift of intuition and can use it legitimately, in service of your clients. </p>
